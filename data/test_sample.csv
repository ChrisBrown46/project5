5,GREAT MUSIC FOR EVERYONE !!!!,"In this cd it contains GREATNESS!!! TRUST ME THIS IS A MUST HAVE!!!If it's to be uplifted by the inspirtational ""Optimistic"" to the great smoothness of ""Everything is going to be alright"" , As Ann Nesby and Sounds Of Blackness take it home with ""I'm going all the way"". The most perfect song on this album is during Christmas time when you have family and they come to celebrate the great ""Soul Holidays"" that makes you want to have Christmas in the middle of the year it just dosn't get any better then that!BrandonLove the album!"
4,Quite pleased,"Great sound, easy installation. Only negative is Mic and audio in share the same port."
5,Great movie,"Had this movie forever on dvd, we figured it was time to upgrade to blu ray viewing and glad we did, you cant beat the quality of blu ray for picture and sound. Best Austin powers movie made. If you haven't seen it, definitely need to watch it."
3,PUDDLES WATER,"IF YOU, PUT THIS DIEVICE ON LOW OUTPUT IT WILL CONDENSE WATER AND PUDDLE UNDER THE MACHINE. IT WORKS WELL ON HIGH OUTPUT WITH NO PUDDLING."
2,Horrible tech support,"I can't comment on the quality of the game because I was never able to run it. I have a very common configuration (Dell PII-450mhz with 128 velocity video adapter)running XP. This game is not compatible with this system. I have been attempting to contact their technical support for weeks but have received no response. I only recently learned that my particular video adapter (very common) is not compatible with this game in XP. It is amazing that they would have not worked this out prior to release. If you buy this game, I hope you don't have any technical problems because you will not receive adequate technical support."
1,Smells like cheap alcohol,I smelled Tomato at a boutique a number of years ago and loved it. This stuff is hideous. It smells more like the carrying medium than tomatoes. It's the worst thing I've ever bought on Amazon in the past 14 years. Wish i could return it but I can't because it's a flammable substance.
4,easy to understand,This book has been a great help for me to understand the basic's of my digital camera and how the different settings work and how changing the setting can produce pictures with different feelings. I would recommend this book to all those new to digital photography.
3,"Just Flowers, No Leaves","These molds work as advertised and the molded butter pats I made came out very nice. Since they are made of silicone the molded butter was easy to pop out with no loss of detail and the molds cleaned up in the dishwasher (I used the top shelf) with no problem.However, they are supposed to be a two piece set consisting of one rose mold and one leaf mold. They are not. They are prepackaged as 2 rose molds, not a leaf in sight. Someone got the item description wrong. Bit of a bummer since I wanted to use the leaf molds for Thanksgiving dinner."
2,Difficult to hear,"I own both a Motorola T730 and a LG VX4500 and have used the MX150 with both phones. Used in conjunction with the Motorola it is basically worthless due to low volume. It is slightly better when used with the LG, which seems to have better amplification on the handset when compared to the Motorola, but I still don't feel it is an ideal solution."
4,Nostalgia of DO iT!,"Historically speaking the book has value... for understanding an ideology the book is worthless as there is no ideology, only anarchy. It's fun read and suitable for anyone wanting to learn about the climate back then. A little revolution now and then is healthy."
4,a good read,"I enjoyed this book. It was a good, warm book between a human and a dog. I like dogs!J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
2,"Good, but NOT excellent","If you are into AMATEUR mediocre video's, buy this one, if not, DON'T and buy the BEST MOTORING DVD and VHS videos"
3,"ok, but","its alright. the unit generation system could use some work and some of the more famous merc units are not even mentioned (where's the 15th Dracon, or big MAC). however, listing of wages and expenses is very useful."
3,IN ALL THOSE OLD FAMILIAR PLACES,"Mistress of suspense Mary Higgins Clark churned out another of her well-crafted if somewhat predictable and implausible thrillers with I'LL BE SEEING YOU. Reporter Meghan Collins is stunned while covering a hospital incident when a dying victim brought in is her identical double! In trying to identify this mysterious doppelganger, Meghan investigates an in vitro fertilization clinic and tries to piece together the events surrounding the mysterious death/disappearance of her father. Clark's narrative is terse and she's reminiscent of James Patterson in her choppy style. I'LL BE SEEING YOU will set no standards for suspense literature, but it's professional work from a smart and prolific novelist."
5,Wonderful change of pace,"I loved their first album, but I also love the folky overtones of this release. Only a band of major talent can pull off such a switch in styles. The Delgados have become a band to watch closely with great delight."
2,Didn't fit my B&D CS1030L,"Description says it fits most B&D 7-1/4 models, but it certainly doesn't fit mine. Just a few MM too wide..."
4,Baron Munchausen meets Dark City,"This is a very interesting film. It has the dark and ominesence type of story, and environment, of Dark City; while still maintaining the more family friendly feel of a film like Baron Munchausen. It actually works quite well. A movie to be recommended to anyone above 8 years old (although it may be a bit frieghtening to some children), this is a well balanced story that captures your attention with a tale of morality, life, and love.As far as the movie itself all aspects are par, nothing jumps put as being particularly special, but you don't notice anything wrong with it either. However, the acting is above average. An important note is also that I have only viewed the French audio version with subtitles, so I cannot comment on the dubbed audio."
2,The fumes really worry me!,"Maybe in ten years I'll know if this is a good product (if I don't have some weird obscure cancer from the fumes). I would have expected them to dissipate after I left it lying flat for several days and using it several times over the last month, but they're still as strong as ever. The mat works well, though, and if I don't have some weird obscure cancer from the fumes in ten years' time, I'll edit my review to give it a higher rating. To do so now would to be premature, though!!"
4,Gets you where you want to be,"Overall, I am very happy with this product.It gets you where you want to go, and that's what it's supposed to do, right?It's very easy to use, which is important for me because I don't read manuals. You get you rchoice of languages and voices, which I thought was entertaining and chose to be given directions with an Australian Accent.Every now and then, it makes interesting choices, like leading you off a highway, making a few turns and then directing you back on the same highway for no apparent reason. If you travel with locals, they may point out how wrong the suggested way is, but in the end, it 'knows' where it's going.I only wish you could password-protect the device so you wouldn't risk it being stolen.I like how portable it is, so once it got you to a city, you can pocket it, change its setting to 'Pedestrian' and it will lead you to the sights better than any paper map."
4,"Fun to play, and gives a small view on money","Monopoly is a game that almost all ages will like. The game lasts a long time, and never gets old, or tireing."
5,Excellent!,"Classic! Musical, comical, boy meets girl. This movie makes you feel good and happy. It seems to pull you in and makes you feel as if you are really in Havana! Great costumes, great musical numbers. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys the classic musicals of the 40's."
4,"Interesting insight, and fresh ""views"" of the breast.","Perhaps not quite what we expected. We (my girlfriend and I) are both interested in what roles the breast plays in sociology and in culture, and hoped this book would grant us some fresh perspectives.There are very interesting and provocative (but I certainly wouldnt call them erotic by any means) images in this book, as well as some fascinating art. Some of it we really would love to have framed.The images are suitable for anyone to look at, with only a few being tantalizing or vaguely... scintillating. It's the kind of book that is good to read sitting down with company and see how you and others react. Perfectly suitable for a bookshelf or coffeetable."
5,Gorgeous and Easy to Assemble,"This mobile is very nice looking, we have the 5 piece bedding set as well and it goes perfectly with that. We are still 6 weeks away from our daughter's due date, but it seems like she should really enjoy the teddy bears and nice music. Big bonus: the music has an on/off switch! I got it up and on the crib in under 10 minutes I'd say, and that was even with changing my mind on which side I wanted to put it on :D."
3,smaller than I thought,"It will work but I guess I wasn't carefull about reading the specs because it's much smaller than I thought -- the whole length handle and blade is 8"" long."
5,Revealing Historical Info,"The Author who was in Hitlers inner circle states that he believes his account is ""Honest""Much of the account details events before and during WWII as well as the Authors personalinteraction with Hitler that presents Hitler in Person and many of the circumstances thatinfluenced Hitlers decisions and Hitlers ideas that were truly shocking not usually related inother WWII Historical accounts.The underlying message of Mr.Speers writing that is not contained within the context of the written format is the consequences of Political Corruption that can be exploited by anyone with enough determination to pursue political means and the power that can be manipulated to any deviant and destructive inventions."
4,Great film,"This is a great film to watch the wonders of nature that God has created for us. It is informative as well as inspiring. I would recommend it, especially for kids and young adults."
5,"Loved this movie, some people are too critical.","If your a sci-fi fan, you'll like this one. It's fun. I feel people are being way too hard on this film. It's no masterpeice, but I liked it. Bai Ling is fantastic and super sexy. It's action packed. I liked it alot."
5,Great Book,A non cynical and practical view of how Machiavelli's principles of statecraft are applicable to everyday life. The author's use of modern figures lends credence to his arguments.
4,Really great tool,"I bought this to replace my Pampered Chef can opener because the plastic handle broke, leaving only the metal frame. I'm used to the 'vertical' type can openers and have tried the 'horizontal' variety like this Oxo before, but to my dissappointment. I found them difficult to use. I bought the Oxo because I like the brand in general and read some good reviews about this product. It works great. My only problem, and perhaps it will resolve itself, is that I find it difficult to intially place the canopener on the can, and also I don't know when I'm done cutting - there's no change in feeling or no noise when you go all the way around the can. I'm still reccommending it though."
1,Sloppy Journalism,"This book is awful. Lee Strobel interviews philosophers who completely deny the Sovereignty of God, and he completely ignores the Protestant Reformers views on these very same issues. The Philosphers he interviews are so eager to push there views and without even using scripture to back them up, like Peter Kreeft trying, but struggling to answer one of the big eight questions in the book called""Since evil and suffering exist, a loving God cannot."" I think this book would completely confuse the reader. I do not recommend this book and I'm glad that I only checked it out from the library and didn't buy it."
5,I remember reading this one,"I loved this one as a girl! I appreciate the fact that Dahl doesn't coddle his child readers and that scary things happen in the book.I only wish it were still running with the earlier illustrations. I am very fond of Quentin Blake, but the first paperback version, which I still own, has more detailed illustrations and more uniquely drawn characters."
2,Not a favorite,Not a whole lot of substance and no action. I stopped reading it after the first 75 pages.
3,Celia deserved to have her story grip you from beginning to end.,"This story should have been one that grips you from beginning to end instead of a chore to wade through. Many names and dates and events could easily have been left out. I love history and usually appreciate a picture of what's going on on all fronts throughout the story, but I'm sorry to say here it seemed tedious and unnecessary."
3,A good read,"I have really enjoyed the Mediator series with Susannah Simon. The books blend mystery, a ghost story, romance, and suspense! I usually read author, Sherry A. Mauro but this writer is just as good. Now I want to read ""The Princess Diaries"""
2,used book,I knew I was buying a used copy of this old book but it's falling apart so is very hard to read. Too bad they didn't repair it or send a better copy. I know the author so really wanted a copy of his book.PEG
1,Heath Zenith Lighting Has Major Problems,"I bought four sensor activated, dual brite lights. One lasted about a month. Took it back to Lowes. Heath Zenith had discontinued the light. None available. Talked to Heath Zenith. They do not repair lights. They do not build lights. They import from offshore and sell to dealers. Warranty is worthless. You can get a refund for a light if you don't mind having lights that don't match. Have looked at number of forums. The Heath Zenith product line is giving a lot of people major problems."
3,Quick read,"I always liked Bob and thought this would be a good read. I did enjoy the background. Not as much laugh out loud as I expected, but a fun read non the less."
5,Great book for every Harry Potter fan,New Clues to Harry Potter Book 5 is simply a must read for every Harry Potter fan.
3,hunger for healing book,I rate this book as ok. It was pretty shop worn. I have gotten other used books on amazon in very good condition that truly were like new. The pages were yellowed.
2,pointlessly unpleasant,"Fincher's a good director, and the film is visually impressive. It very successfully shocks and upsets the audience. Problem is, it is totally meaningless, totally devoid of substance. After the perfectly predictable but nonetheless disturbing finish, you realize that you have allowed yourself to get worked up about nothing at all.The film has plenty of stuff in it that could earn it 3 stars instead of 2, but the net effect of watching the film is negative. (I have nothing against upsetting films, but if they have no real reason to upset you, I'd rather steer clear. I was better off before I rented this thing than I am now.)"
4,Good Stuff,"I love my new Zen MicroPhoto...everything is good about it except the fact that I can't listen to music while looking at my pictures at the same time, and that it says that it has 8 gigs of memory but really when you look at the information screen on the player it says that the total memory is only about 7600 MB of memory...other than that a great product...highly recommended :-)"
3,ok sci-fi thriller,"most of the actors Ive never heard of before, dialog and plot were confusing, special effects were great, the conclusion showed the twist ending"
3,"Ok, but....","Indeed, I received what I asked for, and even though the shipping fee was as much as the cost of the sealing rings, I agreed to pay so I cannot complain about that. The problem was that it took forever to receive it. I ordered on dec 28 and was expected to receive the rings no later than January 7. On the 8th, I contacted the seller and had to do it again because they did not respond right away. Three days later, they contacted me, apologized, and told me they would resend the sealing rings. About a week later, I finally got them."
1,FAILED...10 months,"Got mine as a gift from a neighbor. I used it intermittently to charge my 2 motorcycles. Last week I hoohed it up, there was a hissing sound and smoke. I pulled the power plug out immediately. It's fried."
2,Reader beware,"A glorified cut & paste job, replete with factual errors, clumsy paraphrasing and garbled information. In terms of the book's title, the central error is the continuation of the ""first SEAL"" myth first promulgated by this author and Roy Boehm. Boehm was not the first, nor did he originate SEAL teams. Readers seeking the documented facts should read the article ""What A Tangled Web We Weave"" by retired Navy Capt. David Del Giudice (1st CO, SEAL Team One) in the 2nd Quarter, 2002 BLAST, magazine of the UDT-SEAL Assn.Otherwise, I would suggest that readers consult Sasser's bibliography and read the original works for required information."
3,"Good size, ill-fitting lids","We have two sets of these for our 16 month old boy. They're a great size for sending food with him to daycare -- one filled bowl holds enough for his lunch, another for fruit, etc. However, we have found that, after several months of use, the lids to NOT fit tightly and they constantly leak. The lids are so loose on some that if I try to pick it up solely by it's lid the lid will come off. And only 3 of the lids are useful -- the fourth has vent holes for use in the microwave.In summary, these are ok for dry snacks/foods, but not so great for liquids. The lids loosen with wear to the point of not sealing at all. Still, we got enough use out of them that I feel we got our money's worth."
2,Well,It's a compilation of videos. Non 16x9. Standard stereo. It's good for a view. I bought it for King Diamond video and sold it promptly.Don't waste your time!
5,Potent! Great product as long as it is taken in moderation!,"I had used another ginseng liquid product for years with average effects/results. I bought this on Amazon just to try another ginseng product. Action Labs Ginseng Power Max 4 X, 2-Ounce exceeded my expectations. It is quite potent---one dropper is enough to eliminate fatigue at the end of a long tiring day. On days when I take it in the morning, it gives the extra pep required to manage the stress of the workplace. On the downside, when I tried two droppers full, it made me over-stimulated and I was unable to get a proper sleep. Great product as long as it is taken in moderation. I am currently on bottle 2, and I have a third bottle in stock. I will most definitely buy when all my bottles run out."
3,Fair,"Tried this because Baldacci was recommended by a friend and this is the first in his ""Sean King/Michelle Maxwell"" series. Characters are appealing, if not very deeply drawn. Plot is improbable but interesting. Good enough that I'm going to try next in the series."
3,hard core gamers only need apply,I bought the game after playing the demo version. If I had known how truly hard it is to be good at this game I probably would have selected another.I was looking for a slightly more simple game where details didnt have to be quite so demanding.
4,perfect card holder for playing Hand and Foot!,"This is a very ""handy"" and neat card holder. Just slide the whole contraption up and down the table for the next person to reach!"
1,Glamorest Life? Is this really a word?,"Someone should have checked the dictionary for the correct usage of the word glamour. GLAMOUR AND TRINA IN THE SAME SENTENCE? Even though Trina's attempt to dress up her image may work with the core fan base, she fails to dress up her lyrics and subject matter on this record.Nothing alluring here folks. Just another airbrushed, female rapper.I would like to know why Kelly Rowland would even agree to sing on this project? Next time, say no!Overall, it doesn't deserve a rating."
4,great beginner glockenspiel,"Great beginner glockenspiel but with the rubber mallets the volume is not as great. Plastic mallets work better. I have the acclaimed Angel AX-25 glockenspiel which works as great and has plastic mallets. The CB has the size of a more adult instrument (but more for teens than adults) but for sound you can't beat the Angel, but it is not better than the CB when plastic mallets are used. These 2 glockenspiels are conveniently small and light, and great for any age. The bars for the CB are white and black and aluminum, those for the Angel are steel and all silvery. This instrument is wrongly called bells or orchestra bells--it is a glockenspiel and the German name means ""bells play"" but not because they are bells, but because bells were used before the bars. It is also wrongly called a xylophone, xylophone bars are made of wood."
4,Trying to decide.,"I'm trying to decide wether I should or shouldn't buy this product due to the other reviews?But, I think I should it looks like a great product!"
3,Not too bad,"I happen to like several of the songs on this cd, but what gets annoying is that they all do sound very similar. I have read reviews saying that her voice in this cd is much more adult but I strongly disagree. Her voice is so distorted and high pitched in most of the songs that she sounds like a little girl. Also, the ""uh"" at the end of every word (as an attempt to add sexuality to the songs) gets annoying after awhile. I like the beat of the songs and am glad I bought this cd, but there is just only so much you can take. I would recommend this cd to anyone that enjoyed her last one."
3,Delightful music,"The music from this movie is wonderful, but I can only give it three stars because it came to me with a cracked case, and a scratched disc. If I hadn't lost my paperwork, I would have returned it for another."
3,Quiltagami,"The finished items in this book look fantistic. However, the illustrations are done in line drawings and it is difficult to see the actual turn of the fabric. It would be much better if there were actual photographs used so that the visuals actually matched the end result. Inside the book it says you can contact the published, which I did, but I have not recieved any communication back from them. I would still like more information and better photos to complete the projects in the book."
3,My daughter would love this,"toy if you would make the parts bigger...Yes I know this is geared for older children. I however have a daughter who is will be 4 next April...She wants toys like this but has a sister who won't be 2 even until next February...My daughter cannot and does not get toys like this because for one she is irresponsible about picking up toys like this and for two because her younger sister loves all this barbie and swan lake stuff as well too...It would be extrememly nice if the manufacturer of mattel and barbie products would start making toys similar to the swan lake and barbie, etc, etc...for toddlers and preschoolers to be able to enjoy as well...I don't need any choking happening so I refuse to purchase this toy, let alone hearing the arguments and tantrums that will come of it...For me and parents like myself this would cause only headache is unfair to the younger who are also fans of barbie and barbie accessories as well....."
2,Written by a man telling women how to think to win,"It's a book written by a man telling women how to change their mindsets to become successful. Don't think that since it's written by 3 PhD's, there are lots of researches with statistics to back up the claims. Instead, those insights sound more like his believes (""their"" believes if you count the other two authors, his daughters) and anecdotal stories.The tone in this book sounds like a man lecturing women on how they should live their lives and how they had been doing it wrong. That's why I felt that it's more like a book by 1 author than by 3. I rarely hear women talking to other women that way."
1,Sorry that I let my son purchase this camera!,"I cannot say how very disappointed I was when my son opened the box that contained this camera! The viewfinder was broken, and the quality of this camera, even for the money spent, was pitiful. Please do not waste your time, effort, or money on this camera. The only bright side of this was the lesson learned by my son... you get what you pay for, or in this case... less."
2,Romance Novel,"I picked the book up at the store based on several criteria.1. Science Fiction2. Publisher - Bantam Spectra usually publishes good work.3. Babe on the picture. (I admit not the best criteria)What did I get? A 453 page romance novel. I guess the hottie on the cover should have given it away but the back blurb did sound interesting ""independent trader"" rescuing a ""Zafharin military officer."" But what you get is a strange mix of Star Wars, Moonlighting and Privateer. Female Han Solo and genetically engineer super soldier, for some reason, fall in love and out of love and in love and out of love and guess what at the end they fall back in love. Keep in mind that this creche raised Alexander has never shown emotion in his entire life and after a couple of minutes with Han he is going to through it away for her love. Maybe it was the knock on the head. The main plot of interstellar war, betrayal and trading all vanish in this syrup of true love.Too bad it wasn't a paraody."
5,the best toy ever,I love it. it's so cool and fun. i love watching it grow and i love the games. it's much better than the first one
4,Interesting,"Although not quite what I expected, this book was far from being a disappointment. It is not solely focused on women dressed as angels, it is mainly an erotic Fantasy Photography book. 9 photographers from North-central europe are featured, with more than 10 photographs from each. Styles differ, from body-painting (for a comic-book effect) to completely photoshopped settings and landscapes, to a contortionist/dancer - but always the theme remains, the female in ways you probably have not seen before."
1,whoa,"I. Rockwell must have looked up his 10-dollar word in his 10-cent dictionary. ""Quandry"" is not a word - ""quandary"" is, however. All of this goes directly to the problem with this disc, as well as most other rap discs and their listeners. All of them must be forced to pass literacy exams: otherwise, the whole enterprise amounts to nothing more than stupid people hanging out all day listening to the utter vacuity spilling from the gaping maws of other stupid people."
1,Not worthy of the Close Combat legacy,"If I were Eric Young, I wouldn't want my name to be associated with Squad Assault. Suffice it to say that I am a huge fan of this kind of games and of WW2 in particular and I couldn't get interested to finish one battle. Not only is it far from anything comparable to the CC series, this is supposed to be an improvment over GI Combat which itself was a major flop. It turns out to be inferior to GI Combat in many ways, particularly the battle graphics. This game is not worth its price, save your money and look for something else. I wish I did."
1,Edgar Winner???,"I am always looking for new authors and was drawn to this book because of its status as an Edgar Winner. As I was yawning into page 250, I was wondering exactly when this book was ever going to be interesting, or, in fact, if there was a plot. This book was a waste of time and money. What in the world were the Edgar Award people thinking."
3,Good- but there are better war films,"This film had good cinematography- but it was still both intellectually unstimulating and badly acted. The characters had little depth, and the plot was slapped up to fit the imagery. Want a brutal, intense, horribly true-to-life war film? Get ""Come and See""- miles above SPR. Worth the price- skip this one"
1,Blah.,Great. A bad band puts out a bad album of their old bad release just to remind people how bad they are. NEXT!
3,Good but not Great,"Al Pacino does and excellent acting job in this movie. It is also a well written piece about character and ""choices"". It just gets a little lost towards the end and not as suspenseful as it should be. (A near car accident is scarier than the confrontation with the killer etc)The biggest problem is the casting or maybe the interpretation of the role by Robin Williams. He is so likeable that it's almost like Mr. Rogers the killer. It does not work and ultimately makes this a film that doesn't work. There is no menace to him - someone like Kevin Spacey would have been much better. (altho no one has ever really beaten Anthony Perkins' incredible acting job in Psycho as a likeable killer)Rent or buy this because it is much better than the ""paint by numbers"" suspense movies we usually get. You know the ""Killer goes after the investigators wife and kids"" etc plot. It was actually written about choices of loyalty, Honesty and what matters the most. (Do ends justify means etc)"
4,Fit Grandma,"This is one of 4 new Firm videos I recently purchased - I've tried two now and am pleased with both. As noted by another reviewer Amazon is not listing this right, this is not the ""old"" Time Crunch with Susan Harris and Kai Soremekun. This is a ""new"" Time Crunch with Rebekah Sturkie. She does a great job, cuing and sound are good. It is a nice balance of aerobic bursts and weight work. I did up the weights for me and by my second go at the DVD I had the moves down as they are not too dancy and complicated as some DVDs have been. I'm 60 years old, working out about 1 hour each AM and have been looking for DVDs that have less high impact in them now and this works well for that - some high impact but not too much. I have two more new Firm DVDs to review - hope I like them as well. It is always disheartening to order an exercise DVD and play it to only find out it is a lemon."
3,It's Ok!,This is not a toy that my daughter really responds well to. When I first bought it (2mos) she couldn't even really hold on to it. It was too thick. Now at 6 mos she can hold on to the ring but it isn't one of the toys that holds her attention very long.
3,Book missing CD,"This book is now classified by the publisher as ""out of print"" and this is a reprint. I just got off the phone with Prentice Hall, and the CD-ROM does NOT come with the book, regardless what the Amazon listing says.My lowered rating does not reflect the quality or content of the book, rather a gaping omission on the part of the publisher. The CD is integral to the material in the book.Luckily - it is rather easy to download most of the tools that the book references."
4,It is a great read loaded with incredible descriptive language and fabulous content.,It was great and I would recommend it to someone else interested in the leadership of sir Winston Spencer Churchill.
4,Not just my gut feeling!,"A compelling informative guide to the concept of ""Big brain and little brain"". This book is super And its not just my gut feeling. Readers may also look up ""Natural Stomach Care"", and ""Your Gut Feelings""."
4,Great book...,"This is probably my most favorite book of Jo Ann's and I've read all but one. The book came in good condition, but the service was sloooowwww.Took almost 3 weeks!"
4,Delightful,"I think this is a delightful little book. It is intended for a general audience and fairly accessible. I enjoyed learning more about such things as Japanese aesthetics, waka, Lady Murasaki, and kabuki."
4,"Witty, engaging, clever","This book had me laughing out loud every few pages. It was a fun read -- I was looking forward to each next chapter.You can feel Howard's dripping insecurity, the rut his life is in, the corner he's painted for himself. The characters are all vivid and believable, with the exception of Sidney perhaps.This is not a heavy or deep book -- just a ton of fun and really clever."
2,Disappointing,"I hate to give this case a bad rating, because I was really looking forward to getting it--but it's going to be mailed back on Monday. As I have experience with portable hardware (I'm an animator) I am very discriminating about cases. While this case is very pretty and the acrylic is very strong and can take scratches, it's not a very functional case. A good case should protect your hardware when it takes a fall. While this case protects well enough against scratches (and shows them very well) it has *no* insulation for shock absorption and the front cover pops off *very* easily. This means if you drop your Ipod, it'll be toast or it could get scratched up really nicely as it pops out of the case. It's a shame, because if Belkin made the top lock securely and added a thin layers of foams inside, it'd be perfect. I have a Case Logic case like that for my PSP and it rocks. Too bad nobody makes one like it for the Ipod."
4,"Great event, but dont pay to much for it","I just wanted to let everyone know that my local Wal-Mart has just put out a huge display of old wwe wrestling dvds. Unforgiven 2004 was one of them. The price?? how about $3.88 brand new unopened!!! So, for old those sellers selling this for $7.00 to $8.00 used, you better come down, cause Wal-Mart has it for $3.88 NEW! oh, and there is no shipping charges at Wal-Mart..The used price for this should be around 1.00."
5,Good Music,I like the fact that this CD has so many of Ben E's top hits. Great music that brings back memories of when music was about the heart in love :) Reasonably priced.
5,Great resource for remote temp and power sensing,I have a cottage in northern Michigan of which I do not stay in year round especially in the winter months. I installed the Freeze alarm to keep me informed of any power failure or temperature drop. It is easy to install and setup and make calls for periodic temp and power checks. I plan to add another unit at a different location. Just what you need if you have multiple properties.
3,"Hawkwind - 'Acid Daze,Vol.3' (Receiver Records)","Pretty much like 'Acid Daze,Vol.1' and 'Acid Daze,Vol.2' discs,the trilogy ends here.Another CD compilation with cutting floor material(as some might call it).Has three pre-Hawkwind blues cuts by a solo(?)Dave Brock when he was apparently playing as a street musician,""Dealing With The Devil"",""Bring It On Home"" and Came Home"",plus some vintage Hawkwind gems like ""Space Is Deep"",""You Shouldn't Do That"" and ""Silver Machine"".Obviously aimed toward the completist."
5,Nice WWII mini series,This is an enjoyable World War II mini series about a bomb disposal unit in London. I watched it when it was on PBS in the '80s and have enjoyed seeing it again. Money well-spent.
2,Doesn't last more than a year,Worked fine when we first got it although radio has poor reception as others reported. After about a year one of the display LEDs must have burned out since I was no longer able to set the screen on bright. Next the buttons that turn on/off the 2 alarms started to act flakey -- would need to press them multiple times to get any activity. I'm trying to get a replacement but there doesn't seem to be much choice except GE.
4,Easy to use.,Great little item for storing small screws and nails etc. Easy to see what you have and is a good basic organizer.
5,"Love it, never going back to pads or tampons!","I absolutely love this cup! It is so much more convenient than traditional methods. I have been using it for 2 cycles now and have yet to have any leaking. Once you put in place you can feel it suction and it stays there until removed. And it holds a lot! Even on heavy days, I just wash it in my morning shower, once during the day, then before bed. It is wonderful. Can do all daily activities with it in, just as a tampon, but no worries of leakage down the string. The only negative is that the bottom part is hollow and the very base is a hole, so sometimes if it is not in all the way the small ring can suction on your skin down there and you might feel a slight pinch until you move to where it becomes un-suctioned, then just make sure to place the cup further in next time."
3,Not what I was looking for...,"I wasn't very happy with the layout of this book. It seemed to be a collection of testimonies and ramblings about the authors experiences. What I was looking for was a guide to the cleanse and some hard facts as to what was happening during the cleanse. Not just some guys experiences? Anyway, I found what I needed to know online, and the book is headed to the thrift store..."
3,My New RC -CD,"I was thrilled to listen to this Album-Its quite something and when I opened up the packaging from the thick cardboard box the case was damaged and the CD cover fell apart.So far though, the music from the CD seems alright. I guess you get what you pay for.RS"
5,Best day-to-day knife I've owned,"Owning several (maybe 20-25) small folding knives throughout my life, this by far my favorite on the bases of looks, function, and ease of use. The blade is spectacular, the finish makes it easy to hold, it can be very easily and quickly opened and closed with one hand, and the shape of the blade ends up being more convenient than curved blades for many simple daily functions. I really, really recommend this knife."
5,Practical scholarship that fosters human healing,"Great. Rather than the typical pop psych or dry as dirt theory here you will find a practical approach to human/ spiritual development grounded in readable scholarship.Blends humanistic and Jungian psychology with Native American and Eastern spirituality and proposes the use of imagery (picturing/thinking via internal sensation without external input) to aid human healing. Important notions include: the need to move beyond dualistic views of the human, the need for a balanced view of humans as body-mind-spirit-emotions (and the Western neglect of emotions and spirit), the import to spiritual growth of being fully human, and the power of images to move one beyond the defenses of the conscious mind into the unconscious. Exercizes offered to practice ideas presented."
5,"At Long Last -- The Great Mr. Moto, and Peter Lorre!!!","At long last, the people at Fox video are opening the vaults to release the classic Mr. Moto films starring the great Peter Lorre. If Fox is releasing the films in order, the films in the set should be THINK FAST, MR. MOTO (1937), THANK YOU, MR. MOTO (1938), MR. MOTO'S GAMBLE (1938), and MR. MOTO TAKES A CHANCE (1938). Since none of the Moto films have ever been offically released (with the exception of 1939's MR. MOTO'S LAST WARNING, for some reason in the public domain), this deluxe DVD debut of the Japanese detective/adventurer is a cause for celebration. Hopefully, Fox will show as much care with this set (and as much care with the set of four Charlie Chan films that are also finally coming out from cold storage) as they did with the recent release of their Laurel and Hardy films, with excellent commentaries, notes, and extras. Please Fox, give us the rest of the Moto films soon!"
3,Slow down sister!!,"The exercises are great and all, but towards the middle of the workout she starts to pick up the pace, I simply can't keep up. I don't know if it's just me being out of shape or what, but this is supposed to be a beginner's set. As a beginner, I can't go from plank to cobra to down dog as fast as she can, I need a few more extra seconds and I find myself falling behind out of exhaustion and unable to continue."
1,Liberated!!,"I've read several reviews and see I'm not the only one who felt Uhtred's devotion to back stabbers is not only unrealistic, it's bad writing. As my past review of The Pale Horseman details Cornwell lost me as a fan, and now entirely as a reader, by making his main character so unworthy of respect.I listen to these audio books during my commute. I DON'T want to get aggravated by the masochism of a dunce. Uhtred may not be capable of standing up for himself but maybe he'll swing Serpent Breath against the cobwebs in the library book return box. I'm through with Cornwell."
4,I liked this book a lot,It revealed how some sectors of society are well off. I realize that business ruin themselves from the top down.
4,Harry Potter,I think they are good reading as long as you make it clear that these books are pure fantasy and are just reading books.
5,practical transformation,I found this to be one of the best practical transformational books I have found in thrity years thanks you
2,BAD BUSHING DESIGN,"The bushing is oil lite which is soft. Putting it in the door it fit fine but putting the pin in it crutched it up. There is no need for that type material there. A regular brass bushing would have been better. Now, I'll have to get one made at a machine shop around here, somewhere. I am not sure if Dorman's is the same as or a replica of Chevrolet's version but whether it is or not I am not putting that back in.Oillite works in places such a drive chains, ( motorcycles, conveyors and such ) but the door moves 30 - 40 degree slowly. It's not necessary. I not bother to send it back. Another waste of time and money, either way."
4,Paramours and internal politics.,"Engrossing inside stuff. Strong on all JFK's paramours and sturdy history of the big events; ex, Bay of Pigs, Missile Crisis. The sections about Jackie, particularly redecorating the White House might more likely be skimmed over by the boys."
3,Certainly not a masterpiece.,I'm not a Tyrone Power fan but I don't denigrate him either.It is just that Blood & Sand is one of his lesser movies. For one thing he is just to damn pretty. The techicolor is marvelous & gets a star.There are several actual bull-fighting scenes in the movie. When they go into the studio to do Power's close up it is obviously fake. The whole effect is rather cheesy.The good news is that this is the break-out film for Rita Hayworth. Linda Darnell is beautiful as she always is. It was fun to see a young Anthony Quinn in a supporting role
2,norteamericano-centric,"The maps of the U.S. states and Canadian provinces are very good -- which makes one wonder even more why the entire country of Mexico is limited to a single page in this road atlas (and one that it shares with Puerto Rico, at that!). It's such a pathetic showing that Rand McNally really should take ""Mexico"" out of the title of this volume."
4,A Very Good Historical Book,"I've enjoyed God's Generals II very much. There is a lot of history contained within it's pages. I have learned a lot that I didn't already know so I can say it is definitely worth reading. I did, however, enjoy God's Generals I more, but I think much of that has to do with the fact that it was more modern generals. Anyway, I recommend you get it."
4,Great Player,"GREAT Player am ordering several for Christmas gifts for family, GrAndchildren and friends. EASY TO USE AND EASY TO CARRY."
3,A good book,"I liked most of this book. I have a male chocolate lab and wanted to know more about the breed. It covered every area from showing, to the breed standard to lab behaviors. The only subject I was dissapointed about was the lack of information on breeding a male labrador. I wanted to know more about the basic steps to take when breeding my male lab with a female. For example, when can I breed him? How do I get the word out that I have a male labrador to breed? If you're an owner of a female labrador, this book covered those areas. However, there were only a few lines on breeding a male."
1,Not what I intended,"Be warned the title of the book is mis spelled. After doing months of research I found that due to the lack of room on the front cover of the book they left out a word towards the beginning of the title. It must be read ""How NOT to avoid huge ships"". Apparently after weeks of reading ( and months or research on the internet) it turns out that this book is not intended for the light hearted for it will give you chills down your spine or break it into two later on (literally). You want to avoid ships? Then you're better off reading MAD magazines. The instructions within this book taught me how to crash a ship rather than how to avoid it. I didn't notice this until I crashed into a huge ship, and then later realized that my ship was my car and the HUGE ship was an an ice cream truck. I ended up paying over 9,000 dollars (in CASH thank you) for broken ice cream cones and smashed twinkies. Thanks for the help guys you were all I could count on.."
3,Ok for what we use it for,"We got this monitor specifically for using when we visit my parents. I wouldn't want this to be my every day monitor at home but for occassional use when visiting the parents, it's fine. We have an AngelCare monitor at home but didn't want to spend another $150 for something we're only going to use a couple times a year. This is a good little basic sound only monitor."
5,Fast food at the best level,"I have gone through a couple dozen boxes of these cereal bars, using them on weekend mornings when I have to get up early and run, with no time for preparing a breakfast or grabbing vitamins. These serve me as instant food at work when I simply have no time to get away for a meal. I have got use to their dryness and the peculiar strip of sugar meandering across the top. Someone suggested the sweet strip activates saliva. Ok, an excellent idea, since I don't have time to grab water either. I recommend these bars for people on the go, definitely."
4,Life stories recorded,"Mya Than Tint, a Burmese writer, traveled around Myanmar (Burma) interviewing common people about their lives. Their stories are incredible, even though they seem to represent average Burmese people. He interviews a fortune-teller, a pick-pocket, a photographer, a laundry man, an elephant trainer, a flower seller, several actors, a waitress, and many others (35 altogether). They tell about their parents, childhoods, jobs, hopes for the future, loves lost, struggles to survive. People interested in modern Myanmar can't do better than reading this book. Sometimes it can be exhausting, because the stories are so moving and thought-provoking. If it were more well-written, it would truly be great literature. As it is, it's pretty darn good. Read it, learn, laugh and nearly weep."
3,"Goofy, but Entertaining","""Mutant Man"" is a completely ridiculous, over the top horror comedy. The movie beigins in the 50's, as we witness a woman giving birth to a malformed, demonic baby as some crazy blonde woman and two kids(and a dog) look on in eager anticipation. From this odd start, the action moves to the present wherein an extended family of campers break down in the middle of nowhere. Obviously they soon meet up with the title character and his wacky, cannibalistic family.What could have been a completely stupid movie is saved by its own self mocking humor as well as some interesting characters. The Mutant Man clan are possibly the most memorable family of psychos since Leatherface and his kin first buzzed on the scene.Despite the low budget, this is a pretty well made little flick. It doesn't take itself very seriously, yet still manages to deliver some good scares and graphic gore. If you like offbeat horror ""Mutant Man"" might just be your cup of blood."
5,WOW!!,"I'm impressed! I thought by looking at the size of the book it would take me quite a while to read it. It did not. With each sentence, each paragraph, each page that I read I was pulled deeper and deeper into the story and characters. I found myself hating and feeling somewhat sorry for Thomas Bishop and speaking of-- the ending totally blew me away. I read the same page of the ending three times all the while saying to myself ""OH MY GOD"". After getting so caught up in the cat and mouse chase and into the personality of each of the characters, if the ending doesn't shock you to pieces--nothing will. I am most deffinately looking for more Shane Stevens books. To all the people who reviewed this book and gave it such a high rating - THANK YOU. You are the ones who made me decide to read it and I hope many more Murder Mystery readers will pick it up, also. You will not regret it at all!!"
2,Second failed La Crosse Weather Station,"When my first La Crosse Ws-7014CH-IT Weather Station arrived it did not work. I sent it back and got another one. This one failed after 1 month. I'm generally happy with the station when it works, but it seems as though La Crosse has a quality problem. If you are lucky enough to get a good one you will probably be happy."
1,Completely useless,"I bought the Belkin F5U514 Firewire 800 ExpressCard to work with a new MacBookPro. The card doesn't connect ANY drive, though a single drive gets enough power to spin up. Total waste of time and money. Stay away from this product. Belkin's customer service is almost more trouble that it's worth. No help there.Best,Erin QLos Angeles, CA"
2,"Can't imagine why this was chosen as a ""TODAY SHOW"" book choice",So incredibly boring. The story went nowhere slowly. I could not stand the selfish and often cruel main character (although there was certainly tenderness toward her aunt). Issac had many good qualities but the story itself just dragged on and on.Would not recommend.
3,"The best Saxon effort since ""Power and the Glory""","Saxon really found his way back with this one, although the music is simply 80's metal, nothing new. But it has compact, intelligent and good songwriting."
5,military detox!,"I have completed this fast twice - the first time with my soldier husband before he deployed and the second time with a soldier friend before she deployed! The biggest challenge for me was having to prepare meals for our children while not eating with them! So I have to admit, misery did love the company! Both times I did the fast using just the website for advise but I ended up ordering the book for myself and another friend who is wanting to do the cleanse! This book is so practical, easily read and understood! Knowledge is power and having everything explained will help give the motivation to keep on with it and see it through! My husband and I plan to do this again when he gets home from Afghanistan, and I will be so glad to have the book to refer to the next time around!!!"
4,Saving Dinner,I Received my book Saving Dinner and it came in very good condition. I looked over it briefly until I get more time but I bought it so I could save time on making dinners It looks like a very good book
3,So-So Trike,"I bought this tricycle eventhough I read the mixed reviews. The positives: Good price, good brand name, looks adorable, folds and hangs for easy storage. The negatives: It says it's for 18 months+, but my 2 yo twins are having problems with it tipping over and haven't figured out the whole peddling thing yet.Overall, it's just okay and didn't break the bank."
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!,"A complete and total waste of time and money. Ten more bucks and I could of bought a real ice cream maker. I tried to make ice cream twice, following the instructions precisely and each time I ended up with chocolate milk. It is obvious the unit is designed poorly and the paddle is too cheap and flimsy to churn anything, let alone ice cream. A colossal waste of ingrediants. Wasn't worth the money I ""saved"". In this case, you truly get what you pay for. I am returning this product and never buying VillaWare again. Don't make the same mistake! Save your money or buy a better product!"
1,Does not work with eTrex Venture Cx,I wish I read some of these reviews before I purchased. The battery lid does not fit on the my eTrex Venture Cx although it claims to be compatible. I've also heard it doesn't work with the Legend.
1,Much too hard,I was hoping for an age appropriate work out with Jane Fonda but found it way beyond my capabilities even though I am an able 75 year old woman. But I quit after the first run through and was very disappointed with the video.
3,It's just not for my style.,"When I purchased this Canon case, Amazon did not have a picture available yet. So I gambled.Here is my personal verdict. The case is made of good leather quality and looks elegant. From distant one might think it is a purse for the ladies. Inside it has two pockets for storage of memory cards and another for a spare battery.This case lacks a shoulder strap (duh!). To substitute the shoulder strap the wrist strap of the camera (mine is a S-10) is then used when the camera sits tightly in the case and its strap hangs outside at one side of the case. The flap, when closed, leaves its sides uncovered. In my opinion, dirt or water splashes can easily enter here and damage the toy.I'm looking for a new product."
4,Statistics without talking down,"I have just begun as a consulting statistician, and have found this book invaluable both as a review, and as an aid for explanations for the people that I help. The book goes beyound the bare basics, with very useful discussions of statistical package use."
1,AAAAHHH!!!,"This album is truly terrifying. When I first saw the cover of it, with Hilary looking as if she's about to pull a chainsaw out of one of those ribbony boxes and kill us all, I knew I was in trouble.I'm sorry to say, but I don't think that our queen Hilary Duff has quite the type of talent for the music business. If she insists on staying in the spotlight, I really think that she should stick to acting (though apparantly the only character she knows how to play is a ""dorky"" girl that the hot guy has a secret crush on) and stay faaaar away from singing. It's just that she can't carry a note, and she seems like she's talking a whole lot more than actually SINGING. Not to mention that her voice is entirely computerized throught the whole bloody album!Come on, is this the best that anyone can come up with anymore?? The world really is coming to an end......But if you're looking for a good CD for Christmas, I highly reccomend the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. Now THAT'S some holiday music."
4,Totally cute,"This is a great little romantic comedy. Ashley Judd is adorable and Hugh Jackman and Greg Kinnear are perfect. The most hilarious part of the film is the fake psychologist Judd creates to put forth her comparison of humans to cattle, comparing man's polygamous mating drive to that of a bull. Some genuine laughs and a heartwarming romance. Recommended."
3,It's ok.,I liked a few of the ideas in this book very much. Mostly though the ideas seemed very simple and designed for a younger crowd. I guess I was just looking for something a bit different.
4,Great Album,"If you like The Carpenters, this is a great album. Every song is good, Karen Carpenter had a wonderful voice and this album showcases her talent wonderfully."
5,Buy It,It is hard to believe that an artist this talented could be overlooked.This is a fantastic cd that is full of great RnB songs and smooth jazz vocals.It reminds me of the sound of Sade and Barry White mixed with the pop ballad sound of Hall and Oates.If you like these artist buy this cd you will love it.
2,Even the fish look bored,"This is a wonderful example of what is wrong with 3D television programming. This video consists of nothing more than fish swimming around aimlessly inside of fish tanks. No adventure, no plot, no excitement. This is a great video if you are having trouble sleeping. It will put you into a state of unconsciousness faster than a lobster which has been thrown into a pot of boiling water. Probably the worst 3D Blu Ray I have ever seen. My wife makes fun of it and I certainly would never use it to demonstrate the potential of 3D television to my guests."
1,Problems with Rio - Buggy!,"Save your money, save your time. Search the web for ""Rio"" and ""upgrader"" and you'll quickly realize that this device (like all Rio MP3 players) is buggy and prone to failure after only a few months. We've had ours since Christmas 2003, so it's dead after 9 months.Unfortunately, Rio offers one of the shortest warranties, and their customer service is terrible. The ""fix"" they offered was to replace my Cali with a refurbished model - at a cost of a hundred dollars! Well you can see here at Amazon that a new model doesn't cost much more, so that's hardly a good solution.Avoid the Cali, avoid Rio, save up your money and get a reliable player like an iPod instead.P.S. You may find some methods posted in web forums for fixing the upgrader bug in Rio Chibas, but I could not get my Cali to work using the same methods. I also reformatted the device and reinstalled the firmware but nothing has helped."
5,Basis - the best makeup remover!,"I have used Basis gel for years... not only as a face wash, but as a shower gel and even a shampoo when I am traveling the world. I have skin sensitivities and find that if I use something other than Basis, I get itchy. Basis removes eye makeup beautifully - even waterproof masquera.One note: If you buy in bulk, refridgerate the tubes you are not using, as the product can go bad after a time in warm climates."
5,One of my favorite books,"I think everyone should read this book at least once. It is more than just a sci-fi book, it is a novel, an interesting look at human thought and interaction. It is one of those books you can not stop thinking about, even years after first reading it. The main character interacts with fellow humans in a way that others have never even considered. People around him are either mesmerized by him or repulsed. His ""condition"" is the result of being raised on Mars after his parents had landed their and eventually perished. The story takes place at his return to Earth. Unbelievable that it was written when it was. Many of the subjects examined in this book are edgy or downright taboo even in our modern times. This is a truly timeless book."
2,Aspect Ratio 2:35 is Horrible,"There are few things I hate than popping in a DVD and watching a two-hour movie go by while trying to watch it with two huge black bands on the top and bottom. Okay, maybe it's too much to hope for full screen versions of movies, but how about a more realistic ratio, like 16:9, where you can see what's going on? People with high definition are going to be ordering in in Blu-Ray, and converting the movie to one's MP4 player is a waste of effort (if the movie was worth the effort in the first place).In short, either produce the movie in full screen edition or at least have it available in both. Or just use a 16:9 for everything.They can keep their product. I'll rent it if I feel like watching it."
2,Poorly translated,One of the problems with foreign language books translated into English is the poor way in which they are translated. I'm sure this book in its original form is very good but the translator has turned it into a lifeless monologue. This is the 2nd translation I've read this year (the other was an Allende book) and I've vowed never to read a translated book again (unless it comes strongly recommended by a friend.)
4,Good low budget shredder!,For an economic and cheap shredder it meets the needs of home paper shredders
5,nice putter,"For the price, this is a great putter. Long line on the back to help you line up you put. For $35 and free shipping you can go wrong."
1,POS,"I was looking for a cheap microscope for simple plant observation... Item was received received quickly cheap plastic, switch very flimsy, after wrestling with it a minute and finally getting the 2 AA batteries in the light doesn't even work. Although it was only $6 plus another $6 for shipping I feel I overpaid. Waste of money, I suggest paying the $20 at least to get a reliable product."
3,"Works great, but doesnt sound great","The retractable wires are awesome, i always have problems with getting my wires tangled. But the speakers dont sound as good as other Sony phones."
5,one of the best yet,"Dear potential readers, This book is one of the best yet. So if you are a fan you won't be disappointed. The bad news is this is definatly the end. For now anyway. Everyone is gathered together. You'll find out just who is going to stay on planet Earth. And who will end up together. One of my favorite parts. There isn't much more that I can tell you without ruining it for you. All I can say is that if you are a Roswell fan this is a must read."
3,Great Price Compared to Others - Disappointed In the New Look and Feel,"I just bought a brand new computer with all of the bells and whistles on it, and so I needed to upgrade the software that came with the computer. I looked around and this by far and away was the best deal available.So far so good, but it's a big difference from using the old Microsoft Word and Excel versions of 2003. I'm dissapointed in Microsoft for designing something that seems like I have to learn all over again. I work remotely so I don't have the advantage of sitting down in a class and having someone explain the new features. I use both word and Excel extensively, and I feel like I have 2 new programs now. I wish Microsoft could keep things simple, and make updates to their products without requiring people like myself to take a class or re-learn something that I've been using for years."
2,Disappointing at best,"With Tom Siebel's reputation as a visionary of One-to-One marketing and a software innovator, this book was obvious, fundamental, and predictable, with very little that hasn't been said better and more astutely by other writers i.e. Evans and Wurstler, Shapiro and Varian. This is a collection of the same old success stories culled from the same old interviews and the same old articles. If you're really interested in the underlying changes in the business world that the Internet brings, read ""Information Rules' by Shapiro and Varian or ""Blown to Bits"" by Evans and Wurstler. Heck, even Bill Gates' book ""Business @ the Speed of Thought"" had more insight and better stories than this."
3,"students,sex and acting","New Love in TokyoTwo girls who are working in the sex-business are having fun with there job and with there acting class.One is a dominatrix.You could see very well what she is doing with a Yakuza boss and some other guy who is thought a lesson.At the same time(in the movie) they are having fun with some guys they are dating.I must say the story is part of there(real) live,so don't expect to much action(like in movie-action)but rather pleasant and interresting moments with a lot of laughter.During the film there is also a lot of nude pictures of the two main actresses .Suzuki sawa is very beautiful who also won an aword for this movie."
1,Dull read - stilted language,"I haven't read Curtiss Ann Matlock in a while, and I have to say I was very disappointed. I had to force myself to finish this book. The characters were two-dimensional, the language used was unnatural and the book was just plain boring. There were too many characters thrown in and side stories. The religious quotes that were thrown in were irritating, because they sounded cliche and were used to support whatever viewpoint the character wanted to justify."
4,A Defense Brief for McClellan,"Be warned. This is not a narrative of George B. McClellan's roller coaster ride in command of the Union Army. Instead, Thomas Rowland offers an interesting number of chapters taking aim at historians who have highlighted what they consider McClellan's character flaws. Rowland shows that McClellan was not delusional or mentally unstable and guides the reader through studies on McClellan and the Union war effort. Rowland compares McClellan to Sherman and Grant the entire book and it can get a bit repetitive. Rowland also reminds readers that McClellan faced the Confederate army in its prime. The book is dry and legalistic; more concerned with reviewing other works on McClellan instead of offering a portrait of ""Little Mac."" Readers will leave the book conceding that McClellan was not as incompetent and as unstable as the likes of Stephen Sears make him out to be but still agree with Grant that McClellan is one of the leading enigmas of the war."
4,"Really useful, almost worth the ridiculous price","I got this book as a gift and was shocked when I found out the cost as it is suprisingly thin and looks like it should cost less than half as much, but it really is a brilliant book and I can find no other way to critisise it. The examples are superb and the definitions for every command are concise and accurate. A good idea if you can afford it!"
1,What did EA Games expect to happen?,"A digital rights management that allows a total of three installations? Well, you can install the game but you can't play it until you activate it online, and you can only do this three times. After that, the game is worthless. Even if you change anything in your computer like, say, adding a new video card to improve your system performance, this thing will demand to be activated again. I'd actually prefer SecuRom over this, or to register on-line every ten days (that was the original plan). I will be returning this game and if I see the EA Games logo on a game from now on, I will NOT be purchasing it. I hope Electronic Arts rots!"
3,The Watson go to Birmingham,"I think this was a prety good book it was funny espescially when Byron was talking to Larry Dunn with his deaf language. It to was a very interesting book especially when the watson family got to birmingham and when Kenny went to coillers bay and saw the whool pool,but this book was sad and scary when the church blew up but overall this was a good book."
1,not formated for american dvd players,"i cant use it, its not formated for american dvd players, i wish u guys had made it clear that it was for an british country only"
5,Fits like a glove and looks great,"I really do love the way it makes the revolver look, and it is like it was molded to my hand. I know I will have no problems gripping my weapon even if the grip gets wet, and or (God forbid), bloody. A good investment."
3,ok but not great need some gaskets,Item came with all the listed items on the package. but they need GASKETs.. as they leak like a sieve... I tried this on my water broom and I got soaked....... water spit in my face and all over me..Get some gaskets before trying this item.
5,Finally a real news story,"Finally somebody gave us some truth about what happened, this documentary gives us the news the mainstream media failed to give us about the war in Iraq and how the Bush administration failed us."
5,A Visual Masterpiece,"If your child likes to look at art, this is the book to buy to introduce him or her to the story of the Exodus in the Bible. It will definitely capture their attention. Brian Wildsmith is a great illustrator with his rich colors and incredible detail. I bought a copy of this for our church's library and recommend it for any public or private library. It will surely become a classic."
4,"MF snakes, MF plane, MF great!","This flick was good. Yes it had cheesy lines and of course the action was predictable but I had fun with it. It also appears the actors didn't take it or themselves too seriously just the same. It's not the best movie I've seen, but probably one of the most entertaining movies I've watched this year. Samuel L. Jackson played a role that really reminded me of ""Deep Blue See"" & Julianna Marguiles who's just plain hot. A couple of beers might probably help the plot but as long as you don't watch it expecting too much top shelf acting or a serious movie you'll enjoy it."
1,complete crap,"What's truly horrifying is how many drooling idiots actually believe this is non-fiction. Go read a science book, you morons."
4,Square produces yet another masterpiece!,"For almost a decade Square has delighted us with the mind-blowing series known as Final Fantasy. Final Fantasy 7 is no exception, it has phenomenal music scores composed by ""The Great"" Nobuo Uematsu, stunning graphics, character development, at least 40 hours of game play,and an intense, emotional story line. Although certain areas of the series have changed due to advancements in technology, this game still retains the characteristics that made the Final Fantasy series loved by millions."
1,Total rip off!,This item was not even close to the product I orderd!! It came on time. Butt It was an item that was supper cheap. Not more than a buck..Total trash! I returned this Item!! Be careful when purchasing from this seller!!
2,"Ok for a text book, but there are better books out there","This was a required text for a MBA management class I was taking. While I enjoyed the class, the book itself was disappointing, and even the authors point out that many of the surveys and self-analysis tools are limited because the better tools are all proprietary. Most of the book is a re-hash of standard managment philosophy, with some statistical justification thrown in.If you are looking to improve your management skills, I recommend going straight to the primary sources, which includes most of Stephen Covey's books, along with other management and self-improvement books like Emotional Intelligence, Execution, One-Minute Manager, etc. This book tries to cover the same ground, but ends up being far less informative or interesting then the popular management books it emulates."
4,Perfect picture and sound!,"Elton is a legend with lots of hit singles. This Blu-ray edition has excellent picture quality and sound in the top level.Unfortunately, the show is a bit static. Elton is an amazing singer with a good voice but a bit boring to see on stage. Some lifting will be here and there with personal drive and a great backing band. Congratulations on your 60 years since Elton.You were the best in the 70s.Greetings from SwedenGunnar"
1,Suckfest!!,"A movie so incredibly bad, IMDb does not even acknowledge it's existence! (Go ahead, try to find it!! I went there to gather any kind of insight into why this horrible thing actually made it to any kind of screen anywhere. I still have no idea!!"
5,Excellent Book,"Travis' book is funny, sensitive, to the point and full of words of wisdom. He made me stop and think about my own life and my actions. I would recommend this book in a heartbeat. Whether you're a fan or not, Travis' book is worth reading."
5,You bet I'm talkin to you!,"This is a fantastic DVD...it sets a standard for how other DVDs should be made. There are plenty of extras on the special edition release, including an hour long documentary about the making of the film, complete with interviews with Robert De Niro, Martin Scorcese, Harvey Keitel, Cybill Shepard, and Jody Foster (to name just a few). The picture and sound quality are excellent. A must have DVD!"
2,Bad interferiance,"I got this product as a baby shower gift because it had the ""extended range of 400 feet"" so I could easily walk my dog while the baby was sleeping in the apartment. But I cant get past the front door with out the thing going static crazy and buzzing!! Also at night when my 7 month old daughter is sleeping the reciever in my bedroom lets out this squeal that makes you turn it off and back on for it to go away. Also only one channel works. Dont even spent the money (little that it is) to get this product. You will loose sleep, not get the security and sound sleep you need..."
3,un-ultimate,"Don't get me wrong, I'm a big Guess Who fan, but this collection does not include their very best recording, ""Nashville Sneakers"". If anyone knows how to find this recording, please let me know.Recommended: ""Pentatonic Scales for the Jazz Rock Keyboardist"" by Jeff Burns."
1,Cracks after it dries,It was easy to apply but was hard after it dried. Then it cracked and fell apart. I wouldn 't recommend this to anyone.
4,Autobiographical explanation of forensic entomology,"Goff is a forensic entomologist, basically someone who figures out how long someone has been dead by the insects on, in, or under the body. The book is a tale both historical and technical about the subject: historical in that it provides many examples of his work over the years, and technical in that he provides a good overview of just what he's looking for-which insects he expects to appear at what time.His style is clear and frequently understated, as when he relates that some of his colleagues were somewhat put out when it was found that one of his labs did not vent to the outside as it was supposed to.Anyhow, this is a fascinating if somewhat grisly read about an unusual but surprisingly significant subject. Just don't read it when you're eating!"
3,"This is a STRETCHING DVD, no strength excercises at all.","I think I'm done listening to these reviews on here, this is like the 3rd product where the reviews have RAVED about it and it ended up being not accurate. So Rodney Yee is cool and all, it's a great product to improve flexibility and provide general stretching, but I was actually interested in a back STRENGTHENING DVD. He provided no strength exercises but rather a bevy of different stretches. Don't get me wrong, they felt good and I always felt relaxed afterwards, but it simply was not what I was looking for. Also, be aware: to do many of the exercises you have to have a lot of yoga paraphernalia: blocks, bolster, stretchy band, blankets. For only doing stretches, I would have preferred something a little more simple. Oh well...back to the search for a good back STRENGTHENING dvd!"
4,OPI Pedicure Foot File,It is the best foot file I have ever used it smooths out the callouses on your heel to a very soft smooth feel.Diane from Tumwater
4,Don't see the movie!! Read the book!!,"I read this book about 5 or 6 years ago and have been waiting for a sequel ever since! The first two chapters left me laughing like a lunatic on crack and completely entranced. Read the whole thing in one sitting. The description of the deputy in the jail nearly made me wet myself.On the more serious side, this work flew along and was action packed until you got into the scenes retelling the tale of the female protagonist. I found it rather blah for about 15 pages, then it picked right back up in the same hell-bent-for-leather style that made it so much fun to read.I recently saw the movie and brother....did that massacre a good book. I almost walked out half way through! I was ashamed the plot of the book was not upheld and that I had subjected my friends to such an awful defamation of a wonderful book.I recommend the book heartily!"
3,pretty good,"i watched the first five minutes of this and it looked pretty cheesy so i stoped it.then about a month later i decided to live through it and i dont know why,it started getting pretty scary!not the best in the series,but could be number 2 or 3.less gore in this one"
5,"A show for any age. This is how you make smart, funny television.","This show is a pure unadulterated joy to experience. If you have not given this show a chance, don't miss out on one of the best shows out there. You will not regret it!"
4,Courageous Truth from a TRUE Journalist,"What did CBS journalist Bernard Goldberg do that caused him to be ostracized by ""tough investigative journalists who celebrate whistleblowers""? He blew the whistle---oops--it turned out he blew the whistle on the wrong people though. The ones who dish it out can't take it. What big secret did he reveal? Something anyone with a modicum of objectivity (or even common sense) knew already, i.e., that TV network news is blatant biased.Dan Rather, Andrew Heyward, Eric Engberg...the list of ""tough news people"" who come down hard on others are revealed for the thin skinned hypocrites they are. All Goldberg does is report the facts. He details accounts of meetings, interactions, conversations. Ironically, in his concluding analysis, Goldberg show how Dan Rather became the very thing he hated. I won't spoil the surprise. Hint: it involves Rather's nemesis President Richard Nixon."
4,It s ok,The product is good. I ve hanged 4 winter jackets and work fine.Be carefully with the ranger - they can damage the plastic bag.I ve opened and closed 2 times without problem.Let s see how long does it take to desinflate
5,Gay erotica at it's finest,"What a great book, this is one that you just will not be able to put down once you have started it, Luc Milne does a great job on introducing the characters and you will find that there is at least one that you can identify with.The 2 main characters could not be different at the start and it was quite a twist as to what happened to them at the end !His imagination runs wild throughout the book and he touches on what seems to be part of what every guy fantasises about at some point, be he straight or gay, the book does tend to lose it's way towards the end though, coming across as though either he rushed the ending or that he has left it open for a sequel.I for one will be looking out for Cocksuck Academy II !"
1,Zodiac or a gimmick to the Zodiac,"When I first seen this movie on the shelf at the local Movie Gallery/Hollywood Video I was thinking Zodiac movie that might help piece together the mystery of the serial killer. After watching this I was like, 'what the hell was that all about? that's not the Zodiac it's some gimmick pretending to cash in on a big thing from the 60s & 70s'. I don't know how this movie even got greenlighted, cause the Zodiac seemed to be like a juvenile teenager and not a man like portrayed in documentaries or other movies based on the Zodiac Killer. I give this movie 1 star out of 5."
2,"Sappy, pretentious and soft.","I was suckered in by the buzz from friends. I buy lots of records and can afford to chance getting burned once in a while.This is farty and overblown. The best moment is a Morrisey derivative that is not half bad. I wanted this to be successful since I live in Vermont and Montreal is about as local as it gets outside Burlington. But wishes don't make it so! This really sucks if you like your music hard, edgy, idiosyncratic, wierd or just plain balls-out rock'n' roll (Of recent stuff, I like the new Lou Reed, Mos Def and Le Tigre, to give you an idea of where I am coming from). I imagine there are some old time sorority types who listen to this seriously. After ten tries, I have still not gotten through the whole record at one time (It's that bad). Don't be disappointed; have a friend dub you a copy. Better still, take mine!"
5,Great Quality Replacement for Floyd Rose Trems!,"This was the only trem arm I could find that was constructed like the original arms on my REAL Floyd Rose trems. It fits perfect, tightens up as it should and feels great! I liked the first one so much, I bought more! A+"
1,Blurriest camera I've used - Beware,"Either the rave reviews here are from people shooting still lifes and landscapes, or roughly a third of these cameras are defective.If you plan to take pictures of people or other non-stationary objects, be prepared to throw out about half your shots - this camera has an extreme tendency to take blurry photos. One of the other reviewers set up myblurrycamera.com to document his experience with this camera, and he captures what you can expect quite accurately.One other thing - the box it came in seems cleverly designed to be impossible to close properly once it's been opened, making returns more difficult. That's just annoying."
4,A convenient accessory,If your car didn't come with one of these from the dealership its a great thing to have to keep your glovebox organized.
1,My wife bought it by accident,"I would never have bought this, and I hope it is not a popular version of his song. I don't particularly admire James Blunt's work, but the clean version of this song seems to be popular for the skill of it's making. That I would give it credit for."
4,Wife loved it!,I got this for my wife as an early birthday present. She liked it a lot. The digital copy will be nice on her iPod on vacation next month.
2,Well Arranged but Overproduced,"This is a novel concept for opera lovers and fans. There are some original songs and also some classic arias and ensembles with a modern update. Most of the pieces have been ""enhanced"" with additional voices (e.g. an aria sung as a two-soprano piece, with three male voices as backup).Unfortunately, this album has so much echo and reverb that it is almost impossible to hear the artists' actual voices. If you just like opera music, this is a wonderful album, but if you are a student of the operatic voice, look elsewhere."
4,Good Value,"I've bought two other Benson compilations but I think this is the best collection on the market. With 2 discs, this is good value for the money and it covers a lot of ground; from his early CTI recordings (nothing from the Verve period, however) to his better known hits (""Breezin'"" and ""This Masquerade"") from the late 70s Warner era. If you haven't heard his version of ""White Rabbit"", don't wait any longer; mighty fine guitar playing and a very interesting composition."
5,Fun for All!!,"Although I'm not a comic book fanatic, this book was recommended by a friend so I checked it out. It's amazing! The variety and originality in each story is incredible, and I found myself enjoying each one in a different way. The art is also fantastic, and I recommend that everyone should pick this one up. Definitely a must have!"
5,Awesome Card,"First of all, this card is not a lot more than the 59 block one. The average game requires 3 blocks or more. And there are also many modes of gameplay that require WAAAAAY more than 59. For example, the Dynasty Mode in NCAA Football 2003 requires 216 blocks. To create a player of your own and to save it is 53 blocks. Profiles and settings are another 5 blocks. So if you have this, you can comfortably save big files. I saw this a week ago and thought, 5 bucks more for 4x the memory is not a lot. This is a great deal. Buy It!"
3,Interesting story but hard to follow...,"Christine Wicker has written an objective book about the unusual community of Lily Dale. I am interested in all things supernatural, paranormal and spiritual but I really struggled to finish this book. While the material is fascinating it is poorly organized. Stories start in one chapter and pick up and finish in chapters much later in the book. There are too many people covered and keeping them straight is difficult. Overall, I'm glad I stayed with the book to the finish but I feel it could have been a much better book with a good editor and some organization."
4,Well written; entertaining; amusing!,"I've been a heavy metal, rock-n-roll fan since I was in junior high (late '60s). I liked KISS when they came upon the scene in the early '70s but never enough to really buy their albums. Again, I would listen to them on the radio and like some of their music but not all of it. Nevertheless, after reading this book, I've come to appreciate their music more than before.Simmons has written an honest look at the lives of KISS. His writings come across as sincere with respect to the problems KISS experienced with Ace and Peter. This is what makes rock-n-roll books interesting. I've come away with a greater appreciation of Gene Simmons as an entrepreneur. I never would have expected that by looking at him while playing in KISS!Not that I'll go out and by their albums now, but I will listen to them on XM Radio with a greater interest. The book is very entertaining and certainly worth space on your music library shelf."
5,Absolutely essential historical reference,"This book is quite simply the best book on the 16th & 17th century witchhunts that I have ever read. Well researched and easy to read (no plowing through dry academic treatises here!) it is one of the few books (besides Leonard Shlain's The Alphabet vs. the Goddess) to link the witch persecutions with the decline in status of women in the 17th century and the decrease of women's contributions to society. Also, many of Barstow's points regarding the scapegoating of poor women are all too relevant to 1990's society (witness ""welfare mom bashing"".) A must read not only because of the subject matter but because it is well written."
1,worthless for the price,"It seemed like a great idea, but the ""shower"" flow was more like a leaky drip. The shower head button was difficult to hold in w/out messing up the little water flow that did trickle out. I also felt the tub itself was too short, and my 7 month old is small for her age. Lastly, the handle that is supposed to be used to hang it up on the shower rod to store/dry the tub, did not fit over my rod. It might fit yours though.For being the more expensive tub out there, I definately do not think it's worth the extra money."
4,Pretty good so far!,"Bought it at Target for about $32 and used it for the first time last night. I have a bad cold as we speak and for the first time, I did not wake up with a sore, dry throat. We used it on low speed throughout the night and the definitely lasts for over 12 hours. Unexpectedly quiet, too, even on high speed, compared with old-school humidifiers. I haven't cleaned it yet, but so far, I'm pretty impressed."
2,Very dry and disjointed but interesting,"About the only reason I finished this book was to learn more of the fascinating life Hickok led. I had given up on finishing it up twice. It was really hard to follow as Jospeh G Rosa would jump around in time to much. You'd would lose of when things happened and what order they happened in. The sense of time and place was missing. It was more organized in terms of themes rather then a straight forward chronological account of Wild Bill's life. Nothing wrong with this if your already familiar with Wild Bill's life, but very confusing to somebody that doesn't know anything about it."
1,Definitely DeMille's worst,"I have read and enjoyed most of DeMille's other books, so I was surprised at how poor this was. I honestly thought it must be some sort of parody; the characters are lazy caricatures and the plot is nonsensical and uninteresting. Overall a terrible reading experience. Go read one of his other books instead!"
3,"Good fun, but not his best Burglar IMHO","While Lawrence Block's Burglar series is a bit formulaic (some of the scenes are virtual repeats, at times), his characters are simply a riot. The plot is probably not the best part of these books--the characters and dialog are. So, if you are looking for a hard boiled or serious mystery, read Block's Scudder series or an Agatha Christie. While there is fun in this book (I would prefer to give it 3.5 stars) and a great quote for my collection: ""I swear, if jumping weren't allowed she'd never get to a conclusion"" on page 180), this is not, IMHO, his best Burglar/Rhodenbarr book. Try ""The Burglar Who Traded Ted Williams"" or the new ""The Burglar on the Prowl,"" for instance. Still, I'd recommend reading them all as light entertainment, similar to Block's Tanner series. I must admit, I like the Scudder ones better."
1,defective battery,"not as pictured (no labels), would not charge, fit phone too loosely, the two cover pieces are not even sealed closed."
4,forthegirls,"This video I can recommend to all women who enjoy watching men exploring each others naked bodies. It's not first rate porn, but gives good insights to gay male sex any girl would find well worth watching. And the guys in it look fairly O.K, too."
5,you can FEEL this album,"I gave this album to my future mother-in-law for Christmas (she lives a high-stressed life, thanks in part to me). She put it in her CD player and curled up on the couch. An hour later, I wandered in the room when the album had played through. She was so mellowed and deep in thought that she could only say ""could you press play again?""Later, fire crackling and drinks in hand, the whole family sat down for a chat and listened to it again. And again. And again. All I can say about this album is that it will really transfix you. It captures you, loses you in thought. This is what music should be - pleasant to your mind as well as your ears. I think that nearly anyone on earth could appreciate KIND OF BLUE in some capacity, and it doesn't get any better than having John Coltrane and Co. backing Miles up."
4,A book not unlike a spell,"What makes a book great IMO is when the story keeps you so completely hooked, you are unable to put it down until you've finally finished it in the wee hours of the morning. Prey met that criteria for me. Sure it wasn't perfect. The store became increasingly implausible and fantastic, some of the characters nothing but props, and I sure didn't like how they got ""rid"" of his wife so he could end up with the Luan (or whatever her name was) - hence 4, rather than 5 stars. Nevertheless, a fantastic read. I highly recommend it."
4,The Eagles Farewell Tour 1 From Melbourne,This two disc album is just great music and presentation. Disc one approximately 2 hours is slower paced with great music and performances. Disc two is phenominal with audience participation upbeat and fast past. You will not be disappointed in this purchase.
4,DeLonghi ESAM3300 Magnifico,"Capable of preparing espresso, coffee, cappuccino, latte drinks, and more, this super-automatic machine features a unique beans-to-brew system that grinds coffee beans right before brewing for exceptionally aromatic espresso. The appliance comes equipped with two stainless-steel boilers that provide excellent heat distribution, as well as an instant reheat function, which keeps the machine at an ideal temperature, no matter how long the interval between cups.Likes:Superb coffee!! Great crema, better than coffee housesEasily adjusted cup size & coffee strengthFAST warm-upEasy to cleanEverything works perfectlyDislikes:A little noisy.One of the Best Super Automatics Out There for the Price"
3,Ron Contour?,"I'm not sure what exactly makes this disc the return of Ron Contour.....it seemingly has no connection to the original R.C. album. But whatever....regardless, this is a departure from the norm as Moka did not take care of his own production here. I'm a big fan and really enjoy his work but on occasion it's cool to hear his rhymes in the context of someone else's production. That said, the production here doesn't blow me away. It's decent but there really isn't much depth to the mix.....so the end result is a collection of nice beats and enjoyable melodies with some nice Moka flows on top. Cold Outside is a really cool track borrowing it's title from an earlier Moka and Ishkan song. Anyway, if you're a fan you probably already have this....if you're new to the man start with Flood or Lime Green."
3,worth buying for me,"The first CD, The Sands '61, is the best live performance for that time period I've ever heard. The band is great, horns and strings.The next CD recorded in 65 with Basie is good, but you can hear the voice fading in excellence. Basie band is great. If only Frank never smoked.The third CD is a DVD. 1981. Good but no longer has the voice. Worth a listen. It is Frank. My first live show was '80, great band, great show.The next 2 are in his later years. You decide. I will listen to these recordings from time to time.Later."
1,It stinks!!!,"This album stinks. This is by far their worst album. I'm a huge fan and have seen the band live five times. I listened to this album over and over again, truly trying to give it a chance... to no avail. Sorry. Go out and buy ""Up on the Sun,"" ""Mirage,"" or even ""Huevos."" They are all head and shoulders above this disaster!"
3,BoxWave Stylus,"I bought this stylus to replace the Griffen sytlus I thought I had lost on the recommendation of a friend. Colors are great - not as easy to misplace but like the Griffen weight much better. What is the string thing attached to the end for, anyway?!"
2,Beware Skin Allergy Sufferers,"Within a day of using this wrist rest, I developed a serious skin rash. It was most likely caused by the ingredients contained in the gel of the wrist pad. If it was not for the rash, I thought it was pretty comfortable to use. Instead, purchased a bean-bag type of wrist rest and have not looked back since."
2,wow,Had this sent to afganistan to play around with our throwing knives and after juss a few hits the metal around the edge was destroyed. The target is falling apart after only one day of use. Not that great in my opinion
2,This Madison is kinda ugly,I love Madison but not this one.She is kinda ugly.Do you know what???I saw Bling Bling Nolee at ebay and she is so (...) beautiful.I dont want this Madison but my scene goes Hollywood Madison is perfect.(...)
2,It's already over??!!,"The game is all the description says it is...except it's incredibly short. There are 16 ""adventures"" to get through to win the game...which took me less than 10 hours total. The game, in and of itself, is fun, quirky, and very enjoyable. I just wish I hadn't paid 40 bucks for something with such a short life span; it doesn't seem worth it."
1,Exercise,This product came to me twice without the resistance band and I was trying not to open tne sealed CD until I got the Band but as I said no band came with it.
5,Last of the Dogmen,"I'm not one to watch many movies, let alone watch them more than once. This is an exception. The scenery is awesome and the story line always intrigues me."
2,"Complete Sherlock Holmes, Vol.2","ONly good things abuot this are the ones w/Basil Rathbone. Others are trash. Do NOT waste your money, buy the Rathbone movies separately or in a group, without all the other so early nobody can remember them junk!Cecy Ivie."
5,Great book,Arrived quickly & packaged very well. Not damaged during shipment. Would highly recommend all college students or parents of college students to use.
5,It worked for me,"I thought this book was great. I read it on my way to Vegas, and tripled my money. Yes, it's for beginners, but it teaches you tips and lingo so you don't look, sound, or play like one."
3,Borrow it first,"This is a very long-winded album. I'd suggest you borrow it first. The majority of the songs follow a verse-chorus-verse formula in almost the same fashion. I've had this cd for a week and still have trouble telling the songs apart.IF you've heard ""Pardon Me"", you've heard the whole album"
5,Remington MS2-390,"Product was received on time, effectively packaged at agreed upon price and operated outstandingly.Totally satisfied with purchase"
2,"So many pages, so few information","Very superficial information, not useful for serious reading or research. It almost seems like the author spent more time finding out 101 things to write about just to justify the title, rather than concentrating on in-depth analysis of noteworthy curious."
5,basic more challenging than advanced!,"I got these tapes for my sister for christmas, but it seems that i've actually used them more than her!The set has the instructional, which i have never cared to watch.The basic, which is a 30min workout, it seems to be more challenging than the advanced. The advanced has 20mins of cardio, then 20mins of abs and buns on the floor and then about 8 or so minutes of kicks of all sorts, then a cool down, but the basic just keeps going and going after 20mins and your heart rate has gone up with a great 10mins of lower body with back kicks, and front kicks and side kicks and all that.The 8min workout, its really like 15mins of an advanced workout.One bad thing, Billy just can't keep count of the repetitions in these Live tapes, it is annoying! despite that, workouts are great."
4,a Classic album,"Kate Bush is one of the few ""pop"" artistes that I like, she isnt pop now, but she used to be. Anyway this cd has a very special sound, and it isnt for those that like ""Radio friendley material"" that are ""in"". The song ""Love and Anger"" ""Deeper Understanding"" are great songs, but the song that makes this album one great Album is ""This womans work"". It is one of the best and most beautifull songs ever. I remember when I was a child I was watching Mtv, and this song came on, and I was crazy after the song(this was in 1989). It is a piano ballad, that bring the genre to a new hight. The lyrics is well written on the album, and not the typicially shallow songs, that most pop artist write. The lyrics are deep, and great. Not al of the songs are that great, but after al Kate Bush is awesome, and I wish that the musicians today in that genre(pop) could be as great, Unfortunitially they arent. But since we are talking about Kate Bush, she sure deserves 4 star -:)"
5,Very easy to use,"I prefer to do it myself, first, save a few bucks, save time. Bought the seiko watch online, need to adjust the strap, but jcpenny, Macy would not do it since it is not bought from them. Check how to adjust the strap, decide to do it myself, just $2.99, and a few minutes, it is done. Very easy to use, check the arrow on the strap, align the pin, easy to push them out."
3,"downer, big time","After enjoying the previous movie ten years ago I found that this production deviated way too far from the Thomas Harris book. Had I not read the book ""Hannibal"" I would have been total confused. What happened to the ending in the book? I thought that was a perfect way to end ""Starling's"" carreer. They were together.... Also I thought that ""Mason's"" sister in the book played a very important part. Did she not feed Mason an eel at the end and kill him. Where was she in the movie? What a disappointment after Silence of the Lambs!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Great when you have a crying child next to you on the plane,"The noise-cancelling feature really works. I used them on a transatlantic flight, and they block out a lot of surrounding noise, which is great when you are watching the in-flight movie. They fold up so they are compact to carry, and they come with a leather pouch. The sound quality is good and they fit well on my ears. I would recommend them to anyone who flies frequently."
2,Stopped working completely after 2 months only!,This wireless FM transmitter worked as advertised only for about two months. Then it stopped working completely. Both the charger and the display died suddenly. Apparently this happens often.
2,love ozzy and sabbath...,"but c'mon why did they edit iron man? did they run out of space (only reasonable answer) but why iron man. why not war pigs, (love that song buthas a VERY long instramental part)and that why i rate 2 stars. could have had5 stars but sabbath, you f%$#ed up REAL bad. :("
3,plusses and minuses,I purchased this because it had upconverting for much lower price than competitors. But it sure seems underpowered at 90W per channel. I had a ten year old 100W per channel Sony receiver and it was way more powerful. so that's a disappointment. Wish I had gotten the 705 or 805 model.has a 60 hz buzz on the woofer that I have not been able to get rid of.Customer support from Onkyo was good.
4,Daughter enjoys it,"My daughter picked this out when spending grandma's birthday gift last year and has enjoyed tremendously. It is one of her favorite items and she is getting to the age where dolls are not a high priority toy, so I would recommend this product to anyone who has children who enjoys dolls."
4,great hooks,"I couldn't disagree more with the first review of this wellcrafted and down right fun cd. First of all,"" No Such Thing"" is such a breath of fresh air, compared to most of the mindless drivel on pop radio today. And while I am a fan of Dave MatthewsI think comparisons are unfair. I think Mayer's sound is Uniqueand stands on its own merit. The songs are pop for sure but thereis great guitar work and his lyrics are more insightful and certainly more understandable than some. Great guitar riffs andhooks and just plain good songs. Certainly a welcome sound in Todays era of Technopop and Boy Bands."
3,Not his best,"One of Michael Crichton's strong points is taking a seemingly ridiculous idea (i.e., bringing dinosaurs back to life) yet making you believe that that idea is somehow feasible. Crichton fails to do that in this book. In Timeline, I looked forward to a good explanation of how time travel might be possible. Instead, Crichton gives us a mess of incredibly confusing scientific jargon; which, I expect, he assumed readers would quickly read through in order to get to the action. This would ordinarily not be such a bad thing-- if the action was riveting."
1,What do you do with no directions?,"I would love to report how this product is or is not working, but I received it with no instructions in the box or on the bottle.I'm sitting here looking at the bottle wondering what on earth to do with it!"
5,better than bleach,"This stuff works so well on my laundry, that I started using it for cleaning stubborn stains around the house (in the carpet shampooer, washing away mildew in the shower, cleaning dog doodie area in the back yard, etc) but even if you only use it for laundry, you'll be SO glad you tried it. It works WAY BETTER than bleach ever did, without the harsh wear and tear on your clothes. I've removed stains that I thought would NEVER come clean by making a paste and putting that paste directly the stain for a few hours before washing.... this method removed both coffee and lipstick stains that had already been washed AND DRIED into the fabric! It's unbelievable that it works so well, and nobody seems to know about it. But one thing is for sure... I'll never use anything other than this bleach!"
1,A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT,"Hoping to expand my experience with oriental fiction in a story by a Japanese writer I ordered this impressively recommended novel. It was more than novel. It was wierd, with a story line that wasn't believable even pushing the limits in accepting the supernatural. The amateurish development of the ""monster"" character coupled with detailed episodes of grisley gore and violence might attract Japanese Godzilla fantasy fans. Not me. It didn't end. It just stopped, which turned out to be one of the better elements of the book."
5,Delightful!,"I collect music from the 20's, 30's and 40's and this CD is fast becoming one of my favorites. Simply every track on it is superb: bouncy, catchy, tight danceable tunes. The only one I didn't like upon first hearing it was ""Peckin"". I disliked the voices at the outset but I listened to the whole thing and the rest of it, minus the beginning talk, is just as great as all the others. If you love this early bouncy jazz, you simply must get this!!"
3,More a Summer Movie treatment than a novel.,"Steve Alten's novel Meg reads more like the novelization of a Summer Event Picture that, in the wake the American Godzilla debacle, just didn't get around to happening. But I didn't expect much in the character department anyway, I just wanted a lot of scenes of a giant shark ripping boats and people to shreads. I got what I wanted."
2,"Tragedy, Tragedy, Tragedy","This book is so tragegic, it is depressing. One unspeakable tragedy follows another this entire book, where's the happiness? The happiness described in this book is when you are not enduring an unimaginable tragedy. You can not imagine how bad these characters lives are until you read this book. And you think, well now that they have all had such hardship and struggle, now there will be a little happiness, a little hope for things to come, NO- in this book, more tragedy. Although it is well written, with beautiful characters, it overwelms you with heartache, to the point where you can feel no more pain for these characters. You have no hope for them and your at a loss of how to feel when faced with more tragedy, to the point where I am numb from it. I wanted to finish this book to end the suffering of all of the characters."
4,STRAIGHT TO THE POINT! 4 1/2 STARS,"i DON'T DO THE LONG DRAWN OUT REVIEWS AS SOME OF MY COUNTERPARTS SO READ THEIRS IF YOU WANT DETAILS. GENE STARWIND IS SOOOO COOL REAL AND LIKEABLE. GREAT SUPPORTING CAST, PLOT AND VISUALS. ONE STRANGE EPISODE I BELIEVE IT'S # 11 OR 13 (NOT FOR KIDS) BUT OVERALL GOOD STUFF. IF YOU LIKE ACTION, THIS IS YOUR SET."
5,AWESOME,"Hickam gets better with each book in The Coalwood Trilogy, and I nearly cried as I finished the final pages of this gem. I wanted MORE!!! Read it carefully!"
2,Dull & Boring,"I had last year's knock out kings, and loved the aspect of the training mode. However, this game doesn't have that. Sure graphics are good, but the control was better on the last game...Anyhow, I'd advise to avoid this game. Let's see how outrageous the advertising will be. Don't be fooled!!!! Jason X"
4,Makes my Grandson's eyes look more blue!,A warm garment for the chill of the desert southwest. Washes easily and fits well. I really like the color and it is a very cozy garment for a little man.
5,"The Spirit Window really has just that, Spirit!","The Spirit Window was an extremely capivating book. When I read it, it was like I was right there, with Miranda, feeling and experiencing everything. Ms. Sweeney has a way of making you feel for her characters. It makes you want to laugh when they laugh, and cry when they cry. They attraction between Miranda and Adam was very sweet and captivating. I found it touching. From when he scared her to death when they first met to thier symbolic farewell, it was well, wonderful."
2,A Remarkable Medicine,"The original book dates back some 20 years, and it was concise, to the point and informative. This new edition has been bundled with Mr. Dreyfus' biography, which may be interesting to some readers but it is not relevant to those seeking his views on the medication being discussed (phenytoin). The pertinent chapter is buried within the larger work and has to be sought out.I would recommend searching for his original book, unless you are particularly interested in Mr. Dreyfus' bio."
3,"Not bad, but it sounds almost like a Linkin Park ripoff.....","I heard this CD at a Virgin Store nearby, and I was pretty impressed. Nice vocals, good melody, WHAT?! these riffs sound EXACTLY like the ones Linkin Park uses. Well, they [took] that from Linkin Park, but the rest of it sounds OK. I'm not a big fan of this band, and I haven't listened to the whole CD so I'm not going to judge too much. All I'll say is that in my opinion, they're trying to copy Linkin Park in a way, except not rapping in it. But I could be wrong, I haven't heard all of the CD, so take a listen for yourself."
2,VOICEOF THE BLOOD,"I LIKED THE STORY AND CONNECTED WITH THE CHARACTERS. IT IS A BOOK THAT DELVES INTO THE UNDERBELLIE OF LIFE. THE LANGUAGE IS GUTTERAL AND CRASS. I JUDGE IT HARSH IN SOME RESPECTS SINCE I'VE READ SOME ROMANCE VAMPIRE NOVELS SOME HAVE HAVE ROMANCE DESCRIPED INSTEAD OF USING FU.. CU.. DI.. COULD HAVE BEEN FLESHED OUT MORE, DID NOT LIKE ENDING."
3,Choose the right age for your kids to watch these,"I loved the movie, but my five-year-old niece balled her eyes out watching Red Balloon and couldn't continue halfway through the movie because she found it too sad. She's a sensitive one, so if your child is highly-sensitive or might not be ready for this at a young age, you might want to consider letting him/her watch it at an older age."
1,Don't waste your time.,"A much better title for this book would have been ""Interesting Financial Concepts That Hopefully Some Other Book Will Teach You""As an engineer, I saw this as a very shallow treatment of Chaos Theory that will do NOTHING for those who actually wish to apply it to financial markets. Chapter after chapter poses questions to the reader but fails do deliver the answers. One can only assume that the few diagrams and examples presented are not explained because the author just does not fully understand them.The reviewer who claims that the book was a good starting point may have been partially right. It asks so many questions that now I must find a text with at least one or two answers."
5,The many doors of perception,"This is one of the most interesting books I've ever read. At first, I was convinced that McKenna must be insane (obviously too much shrooming); but then I began to wonder if it was us (20th century American society) that are the insane ones. He truly sees the world from a unique perspective.I must admit that the book piqued my curiosity...and yes...at least for me...it was a mind-expanding/life-changing experience. But, I am a college physics instructor in my 30's whose sole motivation was consciousness and spirituality. I'm glad I never took ""the voyage"" in my teens or twenties, before I had an idea of who I am and what is important. I have a feeling it would have been very destructive."
1,Utterly appaling,"Tri-ace made good games once they were called Star ocean and Valkyrie profile. This poor excuse is way below them in terms of quality.It's a very childish and immature game, not a patch on the seminal kingdom hearts, It's not surprising that kids seem to be the ones enjoying it the most. It has a dull battle system unlike SO3 and has an almost non-existent storyline. Top that off with dull characters and an awful 1 minute ending and it's the worst rpg they have ever made.Dreadful because it could have been good."
4,"A lot of info, maybe not all useful","This is a good book. It contains a lot of information, although not all of it is useful. This is a great book for someone just getting into four wheeling.My personal thoughts are that this book should have been Jeep or LandRover specific (Those are the authors obvious favorites) instead of trying to be all encompassing of 4x4's. Basically, there was not enought specific information on any type of area or vehicle, and not enough gereral information. The author seemed stuck somewhere inbetween, making this book not really good for either use.I did read the book cover to cover, so I guess it couldnt have been that bad either. I gave it four stars because it did have some info and was a pleasant book to read."
1,c250 SanDisk,This MP3 player froze up the second time I used it and would not come back on. would not recommend purchasing this product.
2,Only connects when it wants to.,"I'm using this with an old mac mini that is set up a a home theater box, so Windows users may have a better experience. Very frequently, almost every day, it loses its connection. I hit the connect button on the USB dongle and nothing happens. The only thing that works somewhat reliably is to remove the batteries. The fact that the battery door is flimsy plastic and doesn't close properly doesn't help things."
5,LOVED IT!,"I loved this book so much! It was different and funny, sexy, had a twist you totally didn't see coming and was just awesome. Susan Mallery has created a wonderful book that makes it so easy to jump into!"
5,AN EXTRAORDINARY BOOK ABOUT DAILY LIFE IN THREE CITIES,"This book is a comparative study of daily life in three historic cities. Students of sociology, anthropology, and comparative social history will benefit from reading these first-person accounts of individual aspirations, disappointments, and triumphs.The cultural differences between the French, the residents of the former Soviet Union, and the Californians are interesting, but what these great people share in common and their attitudes facing daily life are valuable reminders of why we have survived as a species."
3,Pretty Close,"I thought the staff to be a little thinner, not sure if I read the measurements wrong but I still got it and use it for exercise quite regularly. Is better for strength and conditioning not so much for general use."
3,Not for Music Lovers,"I found the sound quality of these headphones to be noticeably inferior to a pair of SONY headphones that were only slightly more expensive. The SONY's had great sound, but the pads fell off after 40 days and the company wouldn't replace them because the guarantee only lasts for 30. They were downright rude to me when I tried to get them to stand by their products, and wouldn't hear of it. I gave them to a friend who super glued them back on. Too late I checked the reviews of the SONY's and many reviewers cited the very same issues. Avoid SONY like the plague for headphones.Finally, I ponied up for the Audio-Technica ATH 50 model--and THEY are the ones to buy! Fantastic earphones, with all the sound quality and volume power one could dream of. This time, you get what you pay for."
2,Forget the rubber feet.,"Works as intended, but the rubber feet will fall off (and get lost) the first or second time you use the kickstand. If you are using the kickstand on a surface you don't want scratched, you'll need to glue the rubber feet, protect the floor with something, or get a different product."
1,Photo Misrepresentation,"The photo of the tarp that you see in the picture is not what you will receive in the mail. The photo in the advertisement shows (4) stripes, but what you actually get is (3) stripes - 1 blue, 1 green, 1 yellow. The photo is much prettier!"
4,Special book for older dogs -Owner of Aspenbloom Pet Care,"I've worn out my copy of this book! Jean Callahan really puts it all together for the owner of an older dog. From what to feed, to how to prevent illness this book is not only easy to read through but has a load of resources available. All the illustrations and sidebars, tips, and charts make this book a real handbook for older dog owners. If you have an older dog, get this book and keep it handy because it's a wealth of information.Kim Bloomer[...]"
3,eh,its alright. i thought they were crazier than this. songs become predictable.. there's only one song i really enjoy listening to on this album. other bands have definitely caught up to what fassw used to be.
1,Not what I expected.. it's just a whiteboard session,"This DVD is not what I thought it would be.. this is just a coach standing in front of a whiteboard for an hour explaining the design of the DW blocking schemes.. While I think he has good ideas and concepts, I was hoping for some live examples of the blocking, showing a walk through with proper techniques and such.. Don't get me wrong, this DVD can prove valuable if you haven't run the DW before and want to understand the idea behind power and counters, but don't expect to see the DW in action except for a short 5 minute clip of some plays shot from a sideline handheld camera where you can't really see the blocks being executed anyway."
1,some weird accents,"What I find most annoying about the Potter movies is the weird accents of some of the actors. I especially find Emma Watson's English bizarre. She doesn't really speak words; she makes chippy sounds and you are supposed to divine the word connected to the sound. I find as a result only about 15% of what she says intelligible. On the other hand Maggie Smith is completely clear as is Michael Gambon and many of the others. Radcliffe is quite okay, I'd say 85-90% of what he says is clear. Watson is the worst. For her one needs subtitles to know precisely what she is saying."
4,Great service,"The setp up works fine.I noticed that the sockets to plug in my electrical items were loose.I contacted the dealer through customer support and they were very prompt and courteous in answering my call and helping me out with the issue. The dealer said it was a rare problem and that it will be replaced. Great service, highly recommended."
2,Network Security?,"I purchased a copy of this book for a network security class. In a way it has been a great read, for humor. The terms and programs are dated at best, made up at worst. An example, 'drive-by hacking,'I have NEVER seen this anywhere. It is commonly refered to as 'war driving,' showing its lineage to 'war dialing' or 'Snooping'. I have worked in IT security for the past 3 years and I find this book insulting. But, for a plus, it is a convenent size to use as a clip board, and it does hold papers down on my desk well."
2,out of town. reviewed late,desired more info on oregano and aromatherapy. desire to return for better choice. will orderdr cass ingram - cure in cupboard
2,Unsure about this one!,"Next time, I think I'll buy something that feels more like skin, this was rather large for me. It hurt a little."
3,It's ok,"Not enough sticks, only good for one round of test. But the test results seem to be accurate and easy to use."
5,FUNNY AS HELL,"This is one of feotus's best. Unique funky slammin goofy sick and dark. It's really too bad feotus never got with the hip hop program, he really could have schooled some heads.Modern goth gets it all wrong.Any fan of rob zombie hellbilly delux should check this cd out and see what the real thing sounds like.if you like this cd, check out bug tapping the conversation for the some new school stumbo.The other wiseblood isn't as good but it's got one track thats so slammin that its worth 10 or 15 bucks just to own it. for real."
2,In the tradition of Kenneth Anger...,"Probably no biography is without some value, but this is one of the two worst Chaplin books published. The comedian was hardly a perfect man, and there are things about him even a long-time fan might find bothersome, but much of this biography is trashy and filled with unsubstantiated ugly rumors. David Robinson's CHAPLIN: HIS LIFE AND ART, published twenty years ago, remains the best way to learn about Mr. Chaplin's complex life and work, while Glenn Mitchell's CHAPLIN ENCYCLOPEDIA I have found very helpful. This book is best ignored and forgotten."
3,Decent medium-sized technical dictionary,"This dictionary was a very helpful addition. It even has some computing terms in it. As long as you can deal with all the British English, it's a good resource. Honestly, though, if you're serious about your terms you'll need a bigger dictionary than this. I don't use this one much anymore now that I bought Kunnskapsforlaget's Norsk-Engelsk Teknisk Ordbok by Jan E. Prestester. The Prestester dictionary is more helpful."
5,still my fav,"This is probably not the most accurate translation available, nor is it sensitive to the reader's gender (e.g., ""superior man"" rather than ""superior person,"" conflation of yin with feminine and yang with masculine, etc.). Nevertheless, it's a very intuitive interpretation by Wilhelm and starts off with Jung's fine introduction."
4,check out a new brand,"I loved this monitor for the first year, but the battery started not holding a charge through the day. And now the battery dosen't work at all. I called Fisher Price and they told me that the battery and the monitor was discontinued and there was nothing that they could do. I should have known better to but Fisher Price since this is the second monitor that I have had in 3 years. I went to Radio Shack and they told me they had no replacement and that FP probably has a company make 1 battery for each monitor. That's Fisher Price way to get you to spend more money. I have passed e-mails on to many of my pregnat friends to consider another brand."
4,nice headset for skype,This is a very nice headset for skype. I use it on Linux without a problem.The only cons are dealing with the really long cord and the sometimes uncomfortable hard plastic headpiece.
3,almost two much,"One thing for sure this camera does everything they say it willand more. The only problem I have with it. Is that is bulky and a little awkward and sometimes the polaroid feature will not ejecta photo. For a buisness camera its nice for a family camera it needs a little work one other draw back if you use the polaroid feature alot make sure you have lots of batteries because it is very hard on them. Rechargable one's are the only way to go. It also will take upto 20seconds of video, the digital pic's are very clear and print out on a good photo printer as good as any film camera. J gillespie"
3,no longer ground-breaking,"In 1989, this movie might've been way ahead of its time, but in 2009. the film hardly stands out among movies dealing with relationship crisis. The movie has good. solid performances from the cast, particularly Andie MacDowell, but no one performance is extraordinary."
2,Disappointing,My favorite movie of all time is Somewhere in Time. This book put a whole new twist on the story & I really hated it. I would tell any true fan of Somewhere in Time to not read this!
3,Slight Disappointment,"I had high expectations for this book based on other reviews and was disappointed. The ""simple rhymes"" were a bit awkward to read and not particularly funny. My 3 1/2 year old son (who loves trucks) enjoyed the pictures but quickly lost interest after only a few reads. In my opinion, this book is not in the same league as ""Duck in the Truck."""
4,Sophisticated and eloquent but lacks a concrete purpose,"This book is not a continuous narrative and need not be read in a linear method. Dava Sobel's ""The Planets"" is a collection of essays inspired by our solar system. I usually balk at reading essay books and I wasn't particularly enthused with this book.The Good:""The Planets"" is as sophisticated as a mainstream science book can get, rife with references to poetry, literature, history, and religion. It discusses the planets in context of mythology, popular culture, and mainstream literature.The Bad:Sobel seems more concerned with eloquent and flowery language than with a concrete purpose and resulting conclusion. Also, Pluto is no longer a planet!The Conclusion:This 'page-turner' is a great read if you're at all fascinated by the planets and the cosmos."
2,Didn't last,"Product was great at first, but only lasted a little over a year. It then died and couldn't be revived."
4,For the non-expert this can be a little overwhelming,"This book is well researched and well written. However, if you have just a passing interest in the Battle of the Little Bighorn, or have just begun your reading on the subject, this is not for you. In an effort to solve the mystery of 28 troopers who apparently died in Deep Ravine, but whose bodies are said to have never been found, Michno provides innumerable eye-witness accounts both white and Indian. In the beginning I tried to follow all of them, especially since I had just been to the battlefield, but I soon found it far too cumbersome. Mr. Michno has put alot of work into this, and he deserves recognition for it, however I would recommend this book only for people who already have a very detailed knowlege of the subject. END"
5,Fascinating satirical social commentary,"Shock Treatment is a satirical social commentary, showing how modern democracies often end up being controlled through the media by clever politicians."
3,A Creditable Bio-pic,"I have to admit, I enjoyed Beyond the Sea, but it did not bowl me over like some of the folks here. I give Spacey high marks because it is obvious that this is a real labor of love for him. Not only does he do well with the musical numbers, but he seems to be loving every second of them. In fact, Spacey can sometimes bother me, but here I really appreciated his work. The only drawback was that he did look too old throughout.Bosworth did absolutely nothing for me as Sandra Dee. In fact, I had to remind myself on ocassion who she was playing because I never ever felt it - she just seemed so flat.Overall its definitely worth viewing. Especially for those of us who may know the great music but never knew much about the man."
4,ONE SOLID LITTLE MACHINE,"THIS IS ONE SOLID USER FRIENDLY FAX MACHINE. IT WAS EASY TO SETUP, PROGRAM, AND USE. I SUGGEST YOU ORDER ANOTHER CARTRIDGE WHEN YOU ORDER THE MACHINE SINCE THE CARTRIDGE IT COMES WITH IS GOOD FOR ONLY 30 FAXES. THE REPLACEMENT CARTRIDGE IS GOOD FOR 150 FAXES. THIS IS NOT A HEAVY DUTY MACHINE BUT WILL SERVE YOU WELL FOR PERSONAL USE. THE PRINT QUALITY FOR COPYING IS OK, NOT GREAT, BUT PASSABLE. DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR YOU CANNOT BEAT IT. I COULD NOT BEAT AMAZON[.com]'S PRICE."
1,Poor quality.,"I bought this CD for the track ""Isrealites"" and the audio quality is terrible on this song. I have not had a chance to listen to the rest of it."
5,Awesome Desserts,There is alot of desserts I would love to try. I am glad I saw this.Caribbean Desserts (Caribbean Cooking Series)
1,And All Thru the House,Should be advertised as a book for children. Not expected of McBain. Only 40 pages most of which are drawings! What a disappointment as have read and enjoyed nearly everything McBain/Hunter has written. If had bought new would request refund.
4,review + howto set the timezone,"My wife and I have been using this clock for about 5 years now and like it very much.The dual alarm settings let us both set our own schedules, the atomic time feature has worked perfectly for us (including DST).The speaker doesn't sound tinny, and it's a perfect clock for waking up to music on.The interface isn't perfect, however the interface for almost every alarm clock leaves something to be desired, and I've encountered far worse.Howto Set the Timezone on a T303T:To set the time zone you hold down the ""Mode"" button until the map starts blinking. You then use the arrow buttons to select your zone.After you select it, you press Mode once, and it'll ask you whether you want daylight savings time detection on or off.Change that the same way, and press Mode once when done."
5,You have to check this one out!,"If your child likes music, he/she will love Country Baby! I bought this tape for my 2 1/2 year old neice and she absolutely can't get enough of it. Not only does it keep her occupied, but this tape has been instrumental in helping her learn her colors and shapes.If you are looking for a tape to add to your collection, this is it!"
3,My other review was harsh so i am starting a new one,"Even though i never received the item, this person was very helpful to me and kept me up to date when it would arrive. But is now cooperative with me now that i am asking for a refund. :)"
2,Is Anita Blake losing her thunder?,"I was so excited to receive my copy of Cerulean Sins. Except for a hot sex scene with Jean Claude and Asher, this book was too tame and kind of boring. No exciting fight scenes, no other worldly [tail] whippings. Anita lost her thunder. I am so disappointed I could cry. That explains the 2 stars. I really should get a life."
1,dont understand all the positive reviews ...,"I originally ordered the safety first kensington bc of its beautiful looks, wipeable seat and small fold. When I got it together it didn't fold as compact as I needed so I ordered this graco in rittenhouse. I thought based on positive reviews id love it even though it wasn't my first choice. First thing I noticed is it is significantly heavier than the s1. The fabric is super cheap feeling. It's white and black which looks like cream and black on the photo and doesn't really make sense bc the frame is cream. It'snot made of a even slightly wipeable material. Its plan fabric which would stain horribly. It's way too short and the seat sitting area is not very deep and looks way uncomfortable. Needless to say, id rather the other take up room in my teeny tiny kitchen than put up with this garbage. If you want something better quality with a beautiful look go for the safety 1st kensington from babies r us."
4,"Created, The Destroyer",I chose this rating because it was a good book.I liked this book the story kept you interested all way through.I will refer book to friends.
2,Over my head or just boring?,"I was hopeful when viewing this movie because of the great cast lineup. But one-third into the movie, I started watching the clock. Never a good sign. By the two-thirds mark, I didn't care if I watched one more minute because the story was meandering and nothing was relatable. Very disappointed."
3,"Dower, Japan, and Iraq","Dower inadvertantly wrote in support of invading Iraq, by writing this book with its title about how the Japanese ""embraced defeat."" Dower shows some of the complexity of the postwar in Japan, and the duplicity of MacArthur's staff and the State Department, but it is still way too rosy a little narrative about how the Japanese became ""like us,"" almost (not quite white), as a result of their defeat. Dower has written articles subsequently regarding the fact that Iraq indeed is not Japan, but too late, damage already done."
1,Superman Returns,"It didn't work, i coudn't see the movie, i tried for more than an hour without luck, I want a refund of my monet."
4,Should be 4 1/2 stars,"Tanya Huff's Summon the Keeper didn't disappoint. Claire is a Keeper, a race of beings that keep the balance between good and evil. She's been summoned to a rat trap of a bed and breakfast. She thinks she'll patch up the hole and be on her way, but things don't quite work out as she planned. Her plans are further complicated with the hotel's employee, and young hot male, and the sexy resident ghost.The characters are fully realized, even the talking cat. The only unbelieveable bit is having a male around that will cook and clean without complaint. Where can I find one of those?"
5,"GOOD DEAL! FAST, FAST shipper.",It made my grandson very happy and there is nothing wrong with that!Great seller and shipping was fassssst!My grandson is also learning Japanese and watching in the original version is very helpful.
5,A Child's Anthology of Poetry,"As a former English teacher, a mother and grandmother, I cannot give enough praise to the poems in this anthology. They are not condescending or silly. Many are poems that were not written for children but that children can understand. The poets represented are outstanding poets from many periods in both American and English literature."
1,Not Necessary,"This item was matched with the bark collar and made it seem that it would be needed, however when we received the products these batteries don't even work w/ that particular bark collar."
4,more...MORE!!!!,"This was an excellent reworking of the history of webhead - complete with astounding artwork and writing to measure up to the new generation while keeping the older folk in suspense. When is part two gonna come out ,what with the conclusion of spidey vs green goblin??? The only fault here is that the ending is open and it leaves us impatient for more!!!"
2,And it was downhill from there... (possible spoiler),"I picked this book up at the library at the recommendation of my mother and sister. I started this book anticipating a lot, but once I got to the graphic scene with Daisy and Duncan (who creeped me out), it was downhill from there. I did not appreciate the very graphic imagery. I understood that the point of view was from the third person, but I wasn't sure if a certain emphasis was supposed to be on Daisy. I was just confused throughout the majority of the book. I think that the death of John could have been some great rich material, but the best this book could evolve to would be a Lifetime movie. I didn't even finish it, I was so disappointed."
4,Changed my whole aspect of college,I just survived my first year at college. I was so worried about my grades and keeping my GPA up that I never thought about the other aspect of it. College is not just about making the grades but gaining life-long experience that will help you further.Finding your purpose in life cannot be done without our creator GOD. Read the book called The Purpose Driven Life by Rick
2,Fair - cheap imitation,"Product very cheaply made. No comparison to other brands. The filter has no structure, unlike other filters, which allows it to collapse upoon installation."
3,Excessively Lonnnnng!,"While the movie was okay. I thought that it could have been 45 minutes to an hour shorter. It just seems to me that they dragged the conclusion out too long. I have to wonder whatever possessed anyone to make a movie about a murderer who was never caught anyway... I mean, there is only so much ""meat"" you can put into such a movie to make it interesting. To be honest, I really didn't like it, but it was okay."
4,TRIPLE BEAM-36 Zips,"This is one of the most solid albums I have heard in a while...I'd get it a solid 9/10...The best traks are...36 Zips,Old School Fashion,Across The Border,Addicted 2 The Game,...Go swoop it up and get A-1 Entertainment's first release..."
4,"Great product, does what it says.","Received my earbuddy with no issues. I have a pair of Skull Candy FMJs. These ear buds were not on sendstation's list but I thought I try it out anyway. The ear buds fit, but not in the same manner as the iPhone ear buds. The ear buds have to fit vertically, nested together and the remote buttons fits along the side with the y-splitter along the top. It is a snug fit, but they still do fit."
2,Interesting but dated,"Not very helpful in making plans, because it is very out of date. But it had some interesting history and geographical information. Can't remember if the publish date was given, but that is certainly something I will look for in future purchases."
2,Not really worth the money,"Although it tells time well enough, and has features I want like luminous hands and date, I think this watch is overpriced and poorly designed. It has several annoying features, such as its thickness, almost 10mm. The hands are very skinny, and for some reason there is a triangle at 12 o'clock which I always mistake for the minute hand at first glance. The second hand is black which makes it hard to follow if you are timing something. I am looking for another watch, probably a Swiss Army or a Skagen, both at half the price or less."
4,No VibraCall alert feature,"I bought the Nordic Blue version of the T6200 a month ago. I'm satisfied with the performance. Although I'm a bit disappointed that the T6200 actually doesn't have the Vibracall function (it says in the manual that only the T6210 and T6220 have it). It was actually one of the main reasons why I chose to buy this model over the T5420. I hope ... would revise it's editorial review and omit this VibraCall alert feature so as not to mislead prospective buyers. Overall, it is a great buy though."
1,Two have had faulty wires!!,"I LOVED my Sedu!!! I loved it so much that I purchased a second one because the first one got a short in the wire after I had it for a while. I bought my second one off of an auction site and within 2 months, the same thing happened! There is a short in the wire and it won't stay on. I contacted them to see if they will except an exchange although I do not have a receipt or the original packaging. I have yet to hear back. Although this has been the best flat iron I have ever used, I will not purchase another and suggest that you do not waste your money on this as it doesn't last long!"
4,Good Tool - Wish They'd Had The Smaller One When I Bought This One,"Overall, I like this tool a lot. It's solid, easy to use, and my label seems to be on straight because this tool is accurate. My only problem is that there are so many places I can't use it because of it's length. I bought mine in 2004, before they came out with a shorter version. If you know you'll be OK with the size, I think this is a good tool for the price."
4,Children love it!,Our twin girls love this book. We got one for each of them for Christmas so they could enjoy mass more. They love understanding what is going on!
4,Worth Watching!!!,"I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. It was pretty good. I had never even heard of it. Story line was very interesting. Ending was not what I expected, had some good twists.Definitely worth watching!!!"
4,A Japanese Take on MANOS - The Hands of Fate,"This thing plays out like a Japanese-inspired version of the MST3K-spoofed MANOS - The Hands of Fate, but with bouncy teenage girls and a sense of humor about itself. This movie actually BORROWS from MANOS. From the cat painting on the wall to the watermelon salesman's line ""The lady will be pleased!"", MSTies will find themselves making a LOT of comparisons.Definitely a 'bad, yet fun' title. I can't believe Criterion took this on. I can't believe MST3K DIDN'T take this on."
4,Interesting.,"This book is very good, allthough, is pretty perverted at times. If you can go through the first two chapters without being scared off, you are good for the rest of the book.It is a very good story, which made me think a lot about life and tragedy, and understanding of such. A more advanced read."
1,Garbage,"The vibrating function broke after only using it twice. The reason I'm not too terribly upset is because it didn't work well as a vibrator anyway. The tiny little ""rabbit ears"" just don't cut it, and I didn't pay near the $80 you can find it for on other sites. Still, don't waste your money. It's more novelty than anything else."
4,Good entry level screen,Product was easy to install and reasonably priced. It provides a good picture quality for the money. I think the biggest fault is the lack of adeuqate instructions on how to set the down set point and the screen can't be configured to automatically raise/lower with the on/off of projector.
1,Bad DVD transfer,"This DVD is made from a VHS transfer, so apart from the poor quality of picture, the sound is very bad. The subtitles are a bit helpful, but as the color is white, often they are invisible on white background. There are several times when the VHS tape, from which the transfer is made, is not smooth, so there are white horizontal lines running on the screen. These faults make this disappointing movie worse. I have no idea what the director/writer had in mind for this project, but the story doesn't work at all. It's about an ageing writer, lives in exile in Mexico, who finds again in a visiting young model, the love he had 30 years ago. ""You annoy everyone with your balloons"", says Marianne Denicourt. She is right. When the story fails, sometimes the art helps; but sadly it's Bernard-Henri Lévy instead of Luchino Visconti."
1,Don't Buy!,"Junk. The burn process works fine, but are unreadable afterward. Unless you love collecting coasters, go with Verbatim--I've never had a problem with them."
2,Too small,These chairs look very nice but they are uncomfortable since they are not deep enough. No thigh support at all.
2,Too Big,"I found that this holster sticks out pretty far from the body. If you're looking for easy concealment, this is not the best option."
5,Great resource!,"This Life Application Bible brings God's Word to another level. Let's face it, we've all hit those moments where we wonder what the Bible's trying to say....this resource is perfect for those moments."
1,Garbage,This is one of those products that is completely useless. I tried following the unclear diagram for loading the tape and apparently it just passed through the metal gate and roller and that's it. You still have to place it by hand on the box and then it is very difficult to cut. It would actually be easier and faster to just put the roll of tape on your wrist and have a scissors in the other hand. It's just that absolutely useless. The people who posted the positive reviews must either work for 3M or sell them for a living !
5,Fun toy!,"My four-year-old daughter LOVED this book. Several of her friends, male and female, watched her play with it, and they wound up painting different pictures together. It is easy to play with and quite engaging."
2,Archaic First Course in Numerical Analysis,A constant in numerical analysis for years the second edition has not kept pace with the way mathematics is contemporarily taught to engineers and scientists. The book appears to assume an older format of learning mathematics was used by the reader. The reader will soon be seeking additional texts to make this one understandable.
4,How to trade in the net connectivity era,"Ok, now that every novice traders knows what a flag pattern is, it seems like every market maker is fading it and every novice is losing. Well, if you are on the losing end of that proposition, what to do? Alan Farley has a good set of strategies that can help you overcome this negative net worth situation. Along with Dave Landry's Swing Trading book, I would say that this is a must buy opportunity for the trader who wants to be successful."
4,no other choice,"i love my trax360, but in the place we live there is a lot of wind most of the time so i wanted something to help my kids to feel comfortable during the ride and also for some rainy days, the plastic is well made but it seems to tight to fit well but there is no other choice, so some how it does the job"
5,What a find!,I have been reading science fiction for over 40 years and I follow the genre closely. I was very surprised to find that I had not only missed Hyperion when it came out but the succeeding 3 books. I have seen the title in many bookstores and passed it out of sheer ignorance. It has been a long time since I have enjoyed two books as wonderful as Hyperion and the Fall of Hyperion. The best part of the books is how those groups that seem to be good and evil reverse themselves to climax in a moving ending. Thank you Mr. Simmons
5,great mount for the price,"Definitely would buy another one, we used it for our 32"" LCD TV instead of on our larger Flat screens but it was easy to install and mount."
3,Quick and Easy,"I enjoyed this book. It was a quick read and I like that, although it's set in the present, it deals with Shakespeare. I agree with what other reviewers have said, that other recent mysteries written for this age group are more engaging. Still, an enjoyable read."
5,Stringing the centuries together,"This is a delightful program of music, from Italian Renaissance to George Gershwin, played on modern constructions of historical instruments--archlute, baroque guitar, 19th century guitar and modern. I don't listen to classical guitar that often (the obvious ones, Bream, Segovia), usually going in for popular stuff (Crary, Legg), but Willard gave a splendid concert at a New York art museum earlier this summer and I picked this up as a memento. It is still a pleasure to listen to--elegant, clear playing by a experienced and talented artist."
2,Just Okay,Not bad. Have seen better and have seen worse. Not much to recommend it in terms of being distinctive. One more word: Amen
2,Um... Credentials lacking,I would not write a book that deals with physics as I am not a physicist.I would not write a book about catahoula leopard dogs as I've never actually seen one.I would not write a book about how to be a Godly single woman since I'm married with four kids.I would not purposefully read a book about married life by a woman who has never been married- even if she bases her information on the bible. Because I could skip her book and read the bible.Does it bother ANYONE that the woman spouting off marital advice has NEVER BEEN MARRIED?
2,Not very good,With most things I order from Amazon I get them fast enough. The order was slightly slow then average and when I receieved the book there was junk inside of it that made the pages stick together. Overall had I known the condition of the book I recieved I would have spent the extra few dollars to get it new and faster delivery time.
2,a yo yo read,"i don't know about this one. what man, in his right mind, would actually wait three years for a woman? why can't megan make up her mind about josh? does she want him or NOT? did she actually fall in love with him all those years ago after one little kiss? josh keeps telling her he loves her, but does he really KNOW her or has he just fallen for her beautiful bod? is this a relationship built on love or lust? these two characters can manage big business, but a real relationship? i have my doubts."
2,The Scream Museum,"I thought the Scream Museum was a slow, boring book. I wouldnt really recommend it to anyone, unless they really like those suspence books alot. It was about a boy, P.C Hawke, who dreams of being a detective. When there is a murder at the Museum of Natural History, where his father works, he jumps on the case. Tom, who is the custodian at the musuem, is accused of the murder but P.C knows that Tom wouldnt hurt a fly. He along with his best friend, Mackenzie, try to find the real murderer and prove Tom innocent. They believe that it must have been one of the two co-workers who are now fighting for the womans job. Can P.C and Mackenzie prove Tom innocent?"
2,Too small,"I love Kong products. However, the Air Dog Squeaker Football (Medium) was just too small for my two Labs. I purchased a ""medium"" thinking it was the same size as the one they were already enjoying together. When it arrived, I was very disappointed in the small (medium) size. I even checked my order to see if I had purchased the wrong one. They do not play with this one like the first one due to the fact that it is smaller. That doesn't mean I wouldn't purchase another; next time it will be the ""large!"""
1,Padraig Pearse died for this???,"This book, along with the other two, are beyond generic Ireland. They're an insult to the Irish people. Ms. Roberts makes a big thing about her love for the country but it's obvious she has never been more then a weekend tourist. The entire trilogy is built on a shaky foundation shot full of holes that could have been plugged with just a day or two of internet research. I'm especially turned off by the way she has ignored anything negative in Irish history and skirted the English Occupation like it never existed. The pub in the book was built three years before the start of the Great Famine yet she never addresses how the Gallagher family dealt with it and managed to pull the pub through.I'm all for love winning the day but this is formula romance badly researched with stock characters I could care less about. You want a good love story with some REAL Irish culture? Go read Morgam Llewellyn."
3,Funny,Funny movie with alot of goofy characters. Scott Caan seems to pick alot of the ame type of actors and actresses for all of his films.
2,Cubbies deserve more,"If you are a Cubs fan you will be disappointed because you love anything about the Cubs but this DVD is slow and boring. Giving a so-so look at the ball park, a less than steller history of the Cubs, and no real salute to the fans makes you very annoyed. The only good part was the walk through of a day at the park and the narrator. If you are looking for a good 'past 100 years in Cubs baseball"" don't buy this-but if you buy everything that relates to the Cubs you might as well get it. It is a slow boring documentary with moments of tolerence. Keep shopping."
2,Puerile,"I found Schwartz's retelling of the founding of Islam sophomoric and completely uncritical. If you read this book, read something - anything - to balance it's slanted perspective. Let's face it, Islam (like its Christian progenitor) spread by the sword. With regard to it's contemporary ""analysis"", i.e., that the House of Saud is the primary funder of Wahhabist terrorism: duh. Duh. Save your money."
3,bath gel,"Very light scent,foams up well.Good for morning showers scent is not overwhelming in the early AM. I use it am"
3,"The songs are MUCH faster than on CD, too!","To add to how awful the mix is (my DVD has several sound setting options, none of which correct the problem -- e.g. ""Wrapped Around Your Finger"" has no synthesizers) the songs, most noticable on the ones off Ghost in the Machine, are MUCH faster than released on record/tape/cd. If you're as big of a fan as I am, these in particular sound like old records played on the wrong speed. I'm glad I have this dvd for the bonus features, but now I wish I had the first out of print pressing of the videos in the hopes of correcting the problem this dvd creates."
3,Sub-par welding,"Just got it delivered for my 9 year old daughter, to find it scratched on both sides of the mirror frame and the welding looks like it was done by a child; big gaps and not smooth at all. I am quite sad :( Trying to decide if I should return it or see if the husband can fix it. Very sad face child here too...I talked with the very helpful and pleasant staff at Wildon Home Burns, and they are going to replace the vanity with no charge. I found my entire experience with this company and every employee I spoke with to be pleasant, helpful and professional in every way; I would recommend them to any and all."
3,Disappointing. Not enough Joanne-too much other guy!,Content is good but Joanne's clear vocals are conspicuously absent
1,HORRIBLE,"I think that this CD was the worst thing i have ever heard. It has only one normal song which was i need love. The rest were horrible. All these boy bands make me puke. I mean, these days people with absolutely no talent are millionares. Only in America can people like nsync make it big."
2,Rushed to print?,"I've read all of Bourdain's other books and had a special liking for his ""culinary gangster"" stories. This novella reads like a first draft or outline for a similar story. It needs filling out. I was disappointed and felt that it was rushed through editing in order to capitolize on the author's current popularity. Sorry Tony."
5,Sea life nerd's tidepool bible,"I got this book as a kid in 1985 on a weeks-long family road trip that included stops along the Oregon and northern California coast. I still have it today. To be perfectly honest, I haven't looked at it in over 10 years, but my memories of it are that it's descriptive and useful in identifying tidepool creatures found along the Pacific coast. At the time, I was a little sea life nerd, into collecting shells, among other things, so I friggin' loved this book. It's small in size, too, which makes it handy to take along when you're actually navigating tidepool rocks."
3,Product fine but service not.,The strips themselves are fine. BUT..they arrived in mid-October with an expiration date of November 2009. I'm not sure how I'm supposed to use 100 strips in that time frame. I emailed the company about this issue but got no response.
1,"Crap, just crap.","This is honestly the worst radio ever. The day I opened it I instantly noticed a horrible smell coming from the unit itself. It really smells like ass.It only has a rechargeable battery. They say it lasts for four or more hours, but that is a lie. I received it on Friday. I plugged it into the wall from Friday, all day Saturday, and all day Sunday. I wanted to listen to a show on Monday. Today (October 24, 2005), I unplugged it and turned it on. It lasted for a totally of an hour and a half. THAT'S IT!!!!!!!Not only that, but the reception is horrible. The flashlight is small and weak. It is way over priced. I know radios for ten dollars that are way better then this. Do not buy this crap. If you need a radio buy anything, but this.If I could give it 0 stars I would."
3,Fan died after 2 years.,"Installed in an older Pentium D Dell XPS400 that had a 300 Watt PSU that had also died. The Antec worked very well until the fan decided it did not wish spin any longer. FWIW,this machine had very rarely been been turned off. Thankfully it was still under Antec's 3 year warranty. Moving parts do die."
5,Great find!,The book was what it said it was. Service was on time. Looking forward to a good read this winter.
5,"Get Ready, Great Ready!","This book is life altering and powerful. It helped me better understand God and my relationship with Him. I feel more powerful, more certain and secure. I was given this book by a stranger and I thank her. She worked at a bookstore. Many wonderful, surprising things have come into my life since reading this book. It has changed the way I view the world. When I first began reading it, I could not put it down! It was like a magnetic force. Please, please, please buy this book. The language is simple, clear and direct. It's a well organized piece of work that is perfect for studying since the books overlap and reinforce basic principles. BUY IT!"
3,Very generic,"This is the first book I have read by Jennifer Crusie and I'm not sure if I'd buy another one. I guess this one was one of her first books. The story is very thin and therefore you never really believe that these 2 have fallen for each other after 2 weeks. It had some good moments but just too bland for me. The love scenes weren't that great(too short for my taste), and the conclusion just came a bit too quick for me. Overall an OK read but nothing to get excited about."
5,"14"" Blade Slicer Knife w/ Fibrox Handle",I was amazed at how straight and even I am able to slice with this knife. The extra length is great.
5,My Favorite Movie,"Shadows and Fog is my favorite movie of all time!!! It works on a lot of different levels. The script is intelligent and humorous, the production is brilliant, and the acting is fantastic. The end is profound. I watch Shadows and Fog over and over and see new brilliancies each time. I wouldn't be surprised if 50 years from now, people consider this Woody's best movie."
3,"Smells Aweful, but Jimmy Loves It",I can't stand the smell of this treat. They are very bite-sized (tiny little beads). I wouldn't mind them so much if they smelled a little better. As it stands I can't be near the opened bag without getting naseous. My daughter feeds him treats now.
4,Still funny after all these years!,"I first read this book when it was newly released, and I thought it was hysterical. One really has to be a Beatles fan to fully appreciate the way Shipper took the facts and deliciously twisted them. Now, in the light of Dec. 1980, it has a certain poignant and bittersweet irony, but it is still a delightful read. The footnotes are my favorite part! Mark, I hope you find someone to rerelease the book...and I hope I find a copy!"
3,Exciting but graphic,"Tami Hoag seems to be determined to enter the serial killer sweepstakes with ASHES TO ASHES. She creates a dark, violent atmosphere; almost claustrophobic at times. Her characters are as trapped by their pasts as they are mired in the search for the mass murderer.As much as I liked NIGHT SINS and GUILTY AS SIN, I found parts of ASHES TO ASHES painful to read. Tami Hoag gives the reader more details than they need to know -- unless your are a coroner! I am not sqeamish, John Sandford is one of my favorite authors, but I have never felt pushed to the edge of comfort by his books.On the plus side, the plotting and character development kept me reading well into the night, and though I was disappointed by the heroine in jeopardy ploy at the end, I would like to read Hoag's next book which will feature some of the characters in ASHES. Just tone down the graphic descriptions, Tami. You don't need them to illustrate your villain's evil deeds. We already know!"
3,not the greatest,"I'll start off with what i liked:1. It can clip right on your laptop, or you can stand it up anywhere.2. It was a good price3. It takes ok videos4. Was delivered very quickly, less than 48 hours.Why I was dissapointed:1. Has a built in microphone, but is awful. It captures audio (not very well), but there is a horrible buzzing in the background i couldn't fix.2. I was excited about the lights that come attached, but, they are pretty much worthless. you cannot turn them off or on when you want b/c it has a sensor. when they do come on, they are not that bright and really dont do anything."
5,"It was wonderful, I would love to have a sitting with James",James's book is well written. I lost my Dad to a sudden heart attack when I was 11 years old. I believe that James can speak with those who have passed over. The stories he shares make things so clear. It all makes sense. I hope to someday meet James and have a sitting with him.
1,Lousy.,This is a piece of crap. Don't buy it. The two we've gotten have both had their internal gearing fail. We bought a second because we thought the first was possibly a lemon.
2,Poor Choice,"I bought this last year at Wal-Mart on clearance, just weeks later. The inside became cloudy and full of condescendation. Therefore, this watch isn't even water resistent when giving your kid a Bath. Luckily, I kept the receipt for a full refund, but would never buy this again."
3,Tiny!,"I expected this wonderful little piece of desk swag to be a bit bigger than it was, but the whole thing fits in the palm of your hand! Other than this, the product is fun and durable. DO NOT KEEP THIS ANYWHERE YOUNG CHILDREN CAN GET TO IT! The brightly colored, cartoon-ish pieces may be confused with candy by the very young and are small and made of fairly sharp metal. Caveat Emptor."
2,"Terrible, deeply disappointing","The fight scenes are bad; I'd always seen Sammo in his older-fatter days opposite Jackie Chan and thought: maybe he was better younger?He wasn't.There are only two things to recommend this movie (hence the two stars) --1) The 'fight' between masters early on is wonderful, very different from just about anything else I've seen in 30 years of ""bad karate movie"" watching; and2) The harm-to-innocents that occurs is.. surprising. Different enough to make you wish the entire movie'd been better to justify the thought that went into that bit of storyline.However, it's too much crud to sit through just to enjoy those two bits of pleasant surprise. Rent it if you must but you'll be sooorrrryyyy..."
4,Excellent Book,I did enjoy this book a lot - it is well-written and is more like a diary about Robert Rodriguez. It tells the story of how he did with little money and ended up with a big hollywood success - a true american story.
2,"A quick, mindless read that is not particularly entertaining","I am glad I borrowed this book and did not buy it. It is a mindless meander through a quagmire of repetative drivel. Take out the ultimate solution arrive at by Caitlin, and this book could easily have been a Harlequin Romance. Really- one minute they are living in semi-poverty amid filth during their summer visits, and the next they are wealthy people in sophisticated surroundings. The characters are poorly developed, the plot does not exist and the editors must have no long term memory."
2,Not worth the theatre money but worth the DVD rental price,Ok I love Albert Brooks that is the only reason I made it thru this movie without either passing out completely only the scenes he was in did i stay awake or leaving altogether because even his character was not a developed one. Michael Douglas is now playing a cartoon of himself practically. Candice Bergen is a beautiful woman but she looks hideous inside and out in this thing. A bad taste it left in my mouth. I would not recommend this for theatre prices. DVD or VHS maybe.
2,SD card obsolete,"1 g sd cards are virtually impossible to find and they will only get harder to find. I'm sure this is a nice unit, but I'm sending my back and waiting for a new model of this recorder that will be of use in the future. If you do find SD cards that can be used with this unit, it will probably be on line and you'll pay more for shipping than the card is worth. Come on, Boss/Rolland get with it. It's the 21 century."
5,AWSOME MUSIC,"This is a WONDERFUL CD and I recommend it to anyone. The sound appeals to people who are into any kind of music since it combines an element of pop, rock, punk, and funk! Cann't wait for MELEE to come out with a full length CD!!! :) They put on a great live show too!"
2,Wait till it's a cheap rental if you must see it.,"I don't know how people figure it's like 5th Element, cause there really is no similarity, so don't rent it expecting a good flick like 5th.The movie it's self, is mostly CGI, including many of the characters, and not the best either. They try to merge it with real actors, for so so results. Neither is there anything stunning or exciting in the visuals.The movie it's self, was easy to follow, but rather boring. Revolving around one character who is a big mystery, and turns out to be a disappointment. But hey, it has a cool looking cover right?"
1,Pop,If you like pop music. Try this. A great pop album but not a Pink Floyd AlbumRoger Waters where are you?
5,Terrific CD,This CD ROCKS! I bought the American version a long time ago. This is even better. The two bonuses and the hidden track make it all worthwhile!
2,A Few Good Songs,"I felt that this album was just thrown together in a rush. I definitely expected more from Clarkson on this first album. There are a few good songs, but the CD is just not that exciting. I enjoyed Justin Guarini's CD much more."
2,"Only 3 years, instead of 5 as promised","These were described as guaranteed for 5 years, but have an expiration date that is only 3 years (Mar 2016). Since I am using them for battery back-up in clocks this is a real bummer. Not what I expect from Amazon. Will probably live with it rather than mess with a return."
3,Pretty cool...,"This set is pretty small in size. You only get 2 minifigs: C-3PO and R2-D2. You can fit these 2 minifigs in the pod and open it up easily. This set is pretty simple with really easy instructions. It is pretty small, but if you have other Star Wars LEGO sets that you own, you can have a pretty big adventure playing with them. I recommend this set to Star Wars LEGO fans, cuz you can add it to your collection, and I also recommend this set to children that likes to build simple sets. Hope this review helped you!"
3,Interesting,"This is a very infromative book in regards to hat happends behind bars. However, I have to admit it reads like a text book material locker room/[prision] [...] projection fantasy. But work reading."
3,Definitely NOT worth the price,"Yes, it cuts the nails well.yes, it is stainless steel.But frankly speaking did not find it worth 14 us$.I did not return it as its too cumbersome and too small a product to return.I suggest do not waste money on this.Their are cheaper cutters which will do the same work for 1/3rd the price.Giving it 3 starts because it does the job BUT not worth the extra cost."
4,Excellent in-depth look at first US orbital mission,"If you're a space-junkie, you will definitely want this book. Included are in-depth technical drawings, the complete ground-to-space communciations log of the mission, lots of great color photos, plus a CD-ROM with official NASA video of the Friendship 7 flight. Find out what made John Glenn such an enduring icon of this century. A wonderful glimpse into the early days of the space race."
1,Boycotting Us Weekly,"This deceitful, wretched company is a disgrace to journalism. It is nothing more than a pawn of the extreme left political machine.I, for one, am boycotting this company - at least until they publish a front page apology for this shameless attack on Sarah Palin - if not indefinitely."
2,Nice looking but very tight,"They're really very attractive boots however they were so tight I had to return them. The color was exactly what I thought, they looked just like the picture but I could barely get my foot into them and I'm an 8 medium."
4,Eureka Hand Held Vacuum does the job,I purchased this hand held vacuum after my old original Dirt Devil bit the dust (literally)...the part that kept the dirt from flying back out at you fell off! I researched through customer reviews for awhile before deciding on this product. It performs well on carpeted stairs and hard surfaces as well. I also use it to vacuum out the car with the convenient hose attachment. The fact that the front position rotates to do the vertical part of the stairs is a real plus! The weight is good and it is easy to clean out the dirt compartment. My only complaint is that it is difficult and frustrating to wind up the cord in the given amount of space on the vacuum.
2,"Stop sneaking ""messages"" into my light entertainment","There are pluses and minuses to this work from Doug TenNapel. Pluses include a fast-paced story and some truly inventive plot elements, along with what I can only describe as a joyful spirit that infuses the work. The minuses are some thinly-developed characters, an even more thinly-developed romance, and a tacked-on Christian message that neither develops naturally from the story, nor represents one of Christianity's better offerings. If you're a fan of ""Intelligent Design,"" maybe you'll find it uplifting, but I found the author's attempt to sneak that discredited bit of hogwash into what is billed as - and largely is - light entertainment more than a little annoying. Ignore that bit, and ""Creature Tech"" is a decent, fun read."
1,Unprofessional spy novel,"I cannot believe the author is a professional writer. Trite, oversimplified action, childlike dialog. I seldom don't give up on a book, but did so on this one after 1 - 2 chapters."
2,Why must they edit it so much?,"Okay before I give my reasons for NOT liking this I must tell I have seen the WHOLE Japanese series of Dragonball Z. Therefore I know what was cutout and cleaned. Number 1-I Still dislike the voices, they all sound like cheesy Warner Bros. characters ESPECIALLY Goku. Numer 2-They cut out any sighns of nudity(believe me there's a lot of Goku NAKED in the Dragonball) Also cut out are the actual HITS of the fighting, Example-when the little green guy from the Ginyu force is beating Krillin and Gohan those puffy clouds are NOT supposed to be there! 3-The mispronounce and change everything! Example Goku's Kamehameha is said ""Ka may-ha-may-ha"" not Ka maya maya! Also for those of you that care Piccolo's signature attack is not called ""Special Beam Cannon"" It actually is Hell's Light. All in all it's not that bad but if you can get the Japanese episodes get them instead. You caN STILL UNDERSTAND THE EPISODES AND THEY'RE MUCH BETTER! Trust me!"
4,very wet,"Recently they have more liquid than previously, which leaves streaks at first but it still evaporates quickly enough. CVS and other brands have less fluid, so evaporate more quickly. Since these have alcohol, I use them also as disinfectants, so I like the extra fluid."
1,Eight years ago...,"Eight years ago, Chang believed China has about five years to get its economy in order before it suffers a crippling financial collapse; it's so true, just the exact crisis is not happening in China. But the biggest problem for people like Chang is not about prediction, it's about their out-dated ideologies of democracy fundamentalsim and market fundamentalism."
2,WHINE WHINE WHINE WHINE WHINE WHINE WHINE,I stupidly purchased this DVD on Ebay. The only astonishing thing about this movie was how much weight Gary Oldman lost to play the part. Nancy (Chloe something or other) was absolutely terrible. She whined her way through the movie putting my teeth on edge. I thought Gary's acting was up to par and quite believable but this Nancy girl was a joke. And my head was spinning with questions such as where does a heroin addict such as Nancy afford to buy leather clothes and have her hair perfectly coiffed in each shot. They nearly burn down their hotel room yet the manager shoves them downstairs and still lets them stay. Where was Sid's managers/PR's??????? He was 'SID VICIOUS'.....He was someone. Why didn't he have a minder except for that whining girlfriend. Okay...I'm done.
2,Prairie Wind Blows,"Boy, was I excited for the new Neil Young album, Prairie Wind. I'm a long time Neil fan, and even through rough patches (by which I mean insanity like Trans and Neil and the Shocking Pinks) he's always bounced back with something good.Well, not this time. Coming off his latest rough patch (the Broadway show wanna-be Greendale) he moves right to another.I had high hopes for this album. I love Harvest and Harvest Moon! I bought Prairie Moon as soon as it was released. Damn, what a disappointment. You can hear some good songs in there, struggling to get out - but they're buried under unnecessary strings, horns, and choruses.Produced by Ben Keith, (who also produced Harvest Moon, Comes a Time, American Stars & Bars, and Old Ways). In my opinion he ruined an album that had tons of potential."
1,Something lacking,"I don't know exactly what it is--but this bio of Adams is missing something key to his personality. For my money, the old two volume bio of Adams by Page Smith that I read last summer after visiting Adams house is the real, solid definitive bio. This is artful and clever--the Page Smith books are the real thing."
4,Birds like it too,"This was tested by my pet parrots, which can dismember anything. It has survived 3 weeks and still going!! They love it. Interesting to the eye and ear, and keeps them busy! I suspect a toddler would love this (we raised 3)."
5,encaptures eating disorders to a tee.,"I see this book as a completion, a that's it-I'm not putting up with you any more, Finito!, of my very own trip with Anorexia and Bulimia Nervosa. To this day it has been a total of six-years that I have been up against these two disorders. I was ""lucky"" enough to experience a Tramatic Brain Injury in March '98, and forgot a lot of my sexual abuse. Yet it, the pain & fright, is becoming very present in my life now. As I read this book, I found it to nurture the insanity in, what I say is; me. Mayra has handed over to me Power to remember and kill off this inabiling disabilty. It's Complete, now. Also note, I am 22-years-old(not 12)."
5,Love it,"Love this original soundtrack. really enjoyed listening to anna kendrick as a young girl in this, in which she was tony nominated"
4,Interesting history of the Jewish people,"I bought this book after reading Cahill's Desire of the Everlasting Hills. This was good, but not nearly as good a book as that one. Still highly recommend it for all who'd like a view of ancient religion and the significance of the unique Jewish encounter with God."
2,Too Expensive,Unless you need to build an entire Office solution using Access and VBA the Microsoft Office is just a gouge.Plus I hate the Ribbon. Bring back menus and toolbars.
2,Cuisipro--not!,"I WOULD give this 5 stars, because it really was great straining fine particles, but it didn't last. See pictures on product page--one side became open. Less than 3 mos. of use...return window expired on Aug 28, 2011. That's why I give 2 stars only.Cuisipro 7"" Cone Shaped Strainer"
2,Sports bra runs small & straps are too short,"Yikes this sports bra runs small on all dimensions! I could barely get the 32A over my head. The cups are smaller than most A cups but the worst thing is the straps are way TOO short so you can't convert into the racer back style as advertised. The flexi band/wire is also sort of odd and not that flexible. If you're smaller chested and trying to decide between the Pure Lime Push Up bra and the Bendon Sport Flex Out, I'd recommend the Pure Lime Push Up bra, which is fantastic."
1,This camera is a trouble maker,"I brought this camera on Sept.25.2006.First, the power button does not function. Amazon replaced a new one quickly, No dault, Amazon had a good responding.by December, this camera was no need power button at all, the screenalways shows ""one moment"" or ""remove usb cable"" as long as put batteryin the chamber. I have to send it to repair center and pay the shipping fee. It is really sucks. You can imaging what this camera's futurecould be."
1,Not reliable!!,"I bought this modem for two months, and it starts to disconnect my internet why I am using video chat. I have to plug off and on again. Not reliable at all!"
3,May take time...,On my third box...haven't noticed any great change...but some improvement. We'll see as time goes by.
1,Dreadful & depressing.,"Had this been a movie simply about Julia Child, it could have been great. Instead, more than half of the movie is given over to the tedious narcissist Julie Powell, and the results are predictably horrifying. I know there really are people like this, but I don't need to pay money to watch movies lionizing them. If I could give it zero stars, I would."
4,Blissful mellow gold,"Let's face it...there's never going to be another Dark Side Of The Moon or The Wall and this new release from Pink Floyd singer guitar player David Gimour which takes a sweet laidback approach was initially diappointing to me.I miss the clever lyrics of Roger Waters,hell I miss the glory days of Pink Floyd before hip hop took over the world!However on subsequent listens this album really grew on me.With great mellow guitarwork ,Gilmour's smooth vocals it casts a tranquil spell.It'll never become a classic like most Pink Floyd releases but if you give it a chance it's a pleasantly satisfying often beautiful album."
5,Where's vol. 3?,"This is a great series, I'm still waiting for vol 3. Check out Love Hina too, that's really funny."
2,It's OK,"Bought a long shoe horn at IKEA several years ago for just a couple of buck. Absolutely love it and, of course, they don't carry it anymore. Have been looking for another and bought this one largely based on the reviews of others, even though it's a lot more money. It works OK, but I like the IKEA one better. The shape of the horn seems awkward and I'm not convinced the spring adds anything. You have to be careful not to get it too far down into the shoe because it doesn't come out easily."
3,Luther,"This movie was just okay, the story was good and very true. I did like Joseph Fiennes performance in the movie."
5,dragons why not (small spoilers),This book may seem like lord of the rings but it is nothing like that. Eragon finds a polished blue stone in the forest called the spine that appears out of nowere. he keeps the stone to try to figure out what it is and eventually his egg hatches to welcome the beautiful character saphire a dragon. eragon and saphire train together to overcome the great evils of king gallbatrox and to revenge his uncle from death of the razoc. (spelling) this book is matching up to harry potter and it's the authors first book it will keep you reading for hours after hours with surprising twists. this book is worth your trouble to go down the street and get it. the second book eldest will be out on august 1st have fun with the exellent relationship between eragon and saphire you will love this book.
2,Hammer is cheap,"This is nice, but the hammer head started to spin after the first use. This kit doesn't come with enough stakes for the entire tent, so make sure that you buy extra."
4,Early signs of comic genius 4 Stars,"It's interesting to look back on this movie that is now 10 years old, but demonstrates Carrey's range and comic talent in almost seedling form. A simple and funny pastiche on the private detective genre finds Carrey as Ace Ventura, a pet detective (as the title suggests) who's big break appears to be coming in the case of the kidnapping of the Miami Dolphins mascot. A better than average script with some excellent gags ensues, with some nice cameos for Sean Young as the tyrannical police chief, and not least Dan Marino playing himself in slapstick fashion. But this is Carrey's vehicle from start to finish, his wacky and bawdy character almost explodes across the film, and ultimately steals the show. Often very silly, but consistently funny, this movie should now begin to attract a second generation of viewers, which it will accomplish well, being neither dated, or too topical for the year of production. Enjoy"
4,Insightful and very reader-friendly,"With this collection of essays, rants, and email responses sent to her website, ""The Happy Heretic"", Hayes has constructed a book on atheism/freethought/civil liberties that is by turns hysterically funny and appallingly tragic.From tales of people seeing the Virgin Mary in a waffle to the Pope declaring that ""Gravity Exists!"" Hayes explores the lengths to which people will go to in order to satisfy their hunger for a ""miracle"". On the darker side, the author submits personal accounts of people in her own life that have sacrificed their freedoms, intellect, and even the safety of their own children in order to be a part of a religious system that offers to do the thinking for them.One does not need to be an atheist to get something out of this book. Hayes' attack isn't on God; but rather on the crimes perpetuated by people who claim a form of ""divine right"" to force their beliefs on others."
1,Buy the Original a Man a Can a Plan cookbook instead,"This sequel is cashing in on the Original A Man A Can cookbook that was surprisingly very useful for my bachelor sons. It had dozens of tasty recipes that the boys could do easily by opening several cans of easily procured and stored foods.This one, however is just a microwave cookbook. It involves buying pounds of meat , shrimp, chicken and unprepared foods that need to be cooked properly before even assembling. This is WAY too much trouble for a bachelor when you can heat a frozen pizza in 15 minutes.You might as well just borrow your Mom's microwave cookbook and learn to cook beef and chicken, spending an hour cooking dinner. Do you really want to do this?"
2,This book is out of date!,"I purchased this book based on the reviews which I usually trust.This book is way out of date, this type of scripting has been well super-seded by Windows Scripting Host, or even Kix scripting. These languages are far more logical to learn and trouble shoot then ""if %t:=01"" style of language. To be honest, the photo on the book cover sums the book up, a photo from the 40's of a guy oiling a turtle! dated!"
4,"Nice caddy, though has a bit of a balancing issue","This is a great caddy for the price, and I really wanted the white as I was done with nickel ones rusting. However, I noticed this does not balance as well against the wall as others I've owned have. It tends to slide forward on the shower head, and I am pushing it back often. But it looks really nice, and does the job for the most part! The one other glitch I've encountered is the razor holder doesn't hold that well...and my razor falls down often. ;)"
4,Just what was wanted,"I was asked to find these caps for a friend, as he used to wear caps that were similar. Now that he has these, you never see him in any other cap."
1,Glad I didn't pay for it!,"My son received this as a gift for his 5th birthday. I noticed right away that the toy had a ""warning"" on it not to wind it up more than 1 1/2 times, but kids will be kids (and there's not really a definitive stopping point to the winding), and to make a long story short, the toy never even made it to the pool. He likes to play with the fish, though, but the main piece was in the trash the very first day."
1,"Please, No more Biggie","""Nasty girl"" is just ""Nasty Boy"" The Remix or Part 2. Biggie's verse is th same first verse from ""Nasty Boy"". Then The others on this recorded new material and a new name and new instrumental was given and it was passed off as a new song. That is not right. It seems that Biggie has no unreleased material left and Puffy/Diddy still wants to make money off of him but Isn't he already? Doesn't Puffy/Diddy still make money off of sales from ""Ready to die"", ""Life after death"" and ""Born again""? and What about his ""Press play"" and ""No way out"". It seems to me that Puffy/Diddy will do anything with Bibbie to make money. This song suck and so does the Whole ""Biggie Duets"" Album. If the Biggie Duets is supposed to be what it would be like if the musicians who appears on the album to be able to work with Biggie, that tells me that Puffy/Diddy can't accept the fact that Biggie is gone. Just Left Biggie RIP"
5,"""A man's got to go his own way.""","""Cool Hand Luke"" is about a man who will not give up his values for anything. There's a scene where one of the inmates is shaking his head and saying, ""I don't have any chains"" while Newman is saddled with chains for trying to escape. But really he does have chains and Newman is the one who is free- because he's free in the mind (he hasn't given up his values).Everybody in the movie tries to break him and he never gives up.This is my favorite movie."
5,Goog bye Dewalt hello Makita,My friend who does all types of rehabs on new and older homes has a Dewalt 052 Impact driver. I used his Dewalr 052 drive on a recent job of mine. Then I started my own research about what really makes a great impact driver. The Makita 6980 has a great light for under sinks or anywhere you dont want to fool around with a flashlight or lighting system for a short job. The power at 1100 torque is great. The variable speed for slow starts on screws is what really sold me on this tool. The Dewalt 502 does not have a light or a variable speed . Sorry Dewalt no contest.Happy guy
3,Consider this other book first,"Please note that I have NOT read this book, so read this review with that in mind - I wanted to suggest an alternative, and a rating is demanded, so I put it at 5. Before buying this book, which appears to have a comparatively limited number of foods listed, please take a look at ""The Complete Book of Food Counts"" by Corinne Netzer. I *have* read this book and am very impressed. It gives the protein, carbs, fat and calories of over 12,000 foods, including nearly everything you're likely to encounter in a market, by brand name, and also fast food like Jack in the Box, Kentucky Fried Chicken etc. It's a great help in evaluating an unfamiliar food choice, particularly in that it can give an accurate measure of carbs instead of rounding to the nearest one for a ""serving"" as is done on packages."
2,Just O.K.,"I was disappointed in the game engine, but it's still ok for people who aren't used to better games like Battlefield 2 or Half-Life 2"
5,I love it!,It came just like what I expected. It works well. Much cheaper comparing to the one at office depo that I wanted to buy before.
2,not worth it,I thought this would be fun for my son to play with his dad in the yard. It wouldnt fly well and it broke after like 2 throws! Besides the fact that it is an airplane (which makes him like it) this toy is awful.
1,Not what was shown.,I returned this product because it was not the unit that was shown in the picture. The seller did refund my purchase amount and said they were changing the picture but as I write this the same picture is still displayed. I cannot rate the trimmer because I never used it.
5,LOVE IT...LOVE IT!!!!,"I just love my Kindle. It does everything I except it to do. It's easy to hold in my hands and I am not going to purchase a cover because it will semms like a book and I do not want that. It also good on my eyes. My eyes start to tear up after an hour of reading, yesterday I read for 4 hours and my eyes was not tired at all. If I didn't have to go to work the next day I would have read throughout the night. I love this purchase and I highly recommend it."
2,Disappointed,I wanted something like this so that I could learn Armenian by hearing how the Armenian words were spoken.Not so! When are you going to create one of these artclesfor Americans so that we Americans can hear-learn Armenian?
1,Cheap quality,"This thing looked and felt so cheap, I didn't even want to try it for fear of ruining something. So I bought a real one from apple."
3,Watch out for that shark!,"This book surprised me. I was actually somewhat entertained although my imagination had to reach in some parts....cutting the shark's heart with a tooth from the inside? Un-huh... Gotcha. Felt like some serious Hollywoodism going on. Although I found the writing a tad on the juvenile side in the beginning, it seemed to improve over the remainder of the novel. Bonus, it's short! I was done in one sitting. Let's just say, I was entertained enough to go out and purchase the sequel... I'll let you know later how that one went!"
1,"Good idea, bad quality","My wife an I were happy to find these for both safety and aesthetic reasons. We bought two and were so pleased with them we bought two more. But after about a month of using them, two of the four stopped working, so now there is just a bulky box hanging on the end of our blind cords, making them possibly more dangerous then when I started. I would not recommend this product for anyone."
5,Get it now,probably the most useful novel of our decade if our own govt. wants to block it its probably great. buy it!
4,short and has been reissued with 2 Franck pieces,"Telarc CD 80637 adds Cesar Franck pieces ""Fantasie in A"" and ""Pastorale, Op 19"" making the total time of the reissue 61:39. 2004"
3,Not what I was looking for.,I was looking for an item to use that I could drive my truck in the garage and bump the front wall without damaging anything. This is kinda flimsy. Would be fine to keep doors from scratching or denting. I sent it back.
4,Truth about slavery,"I don't do well just picking up a book, reading it through and keeping interest throughout. This book was part of a history course and I have found it very interesting as well as informative. Growing up I always heard of how slaves were treated but when you actually read it from a ""SLAVES"" view, it brings a whole new perspective. I would recommend it for anyone."
1,Huh?,"I tried really hard but couldn't make it past the first third of this book. I kept waiting for the passengers and crew of the doomed spaceship to show some sort of reaction to having their ship fall out of the sky, but they seemed to treat it like a fire drill. As far as I know the plot was great, but the writing style was too muddy and confusing."
4,Costa Rica Wildlife,This book gives an excellent overall review of the Pacific rainforest and it's inhabitants in Pacific Costa Rica while encouraging the reader to contemplate preservation of the fragile ecosystems. Very readable. I recommend it to interested travellers to the region.
1,weedeater,We received this weedeater and after three days tryimg to keep it running we had to put it in the shop and they charged us $35.00. Too expensive to send it back and pay shipping again. Wont buy this type of item here anymore. should have worked from the beginning. we are very experienced with outdoor equipment but could not get it strated and keep it running.
4,Reviews from Brizmus Blogs Books,"This book was a great look at what it must have been like for an American woman to be living in Japan during the Vietnam war. It was touching and heartwarming, and I managed to basically adore it despite not really liking the two main characters. I think that's saying a lot.Throughout the book, we really come to understand the characters and what it feels to live in a country that does not understand or really accept you. It is beautifully written and engaging; even in just the way it is written, with smooth, flowing dialogue and description, the reader comes to understand what it must be like to be immersed in Japan and Japanese thought."
3,The War and Peace of JAVA programming,"I think I would have liked this book a lot better if they removed all instances of Ivor Hortens mug from the covers. Ivor, this is for you:System.out.println('remove ivors mug');"
1,My ears are bleeding,"This cartoon is why so many adults hate 'cartoons.' If you're going to do a show about Sonic in a BAND and hire only one voice actor, why not hire one who can actually sing? They do exist.Painful to listen to, with an animation quality that's equally painful to watch.Possibly the worst drivel the Sonic series has ever produced, and considering some of the lemons they've been willing to slap Sonic's name on, that is saying something.Too bad I will probably have to buy the rest of the series for a young family member, since for some reason, kids too young to have developed taste beyond 'it's animated' love the bad singing and washed out, pathetic excuses for a plot. It barely fits into the rest of the Sonic shows- was probably developed to have other main characters and they slapped Sonic into it just so someone would actually watch it. It'd never have sold without a major character glued on.If your kids haven't seen it, don't let them get started on it. Your ears will thank you."
5,Terrific,Really good book I could read it over and over again I especially liked the ending of it and how he came back to her
1,i thought it was boreing and was too repetitive.,"i really thought that the same events and problems kept on comming up over and over and over again, i would NEVER reccomend this for a book report, its not good for that, cuz thats what i had to do and i got a bad grade for being too repetitve of myself...bye."
4,Worth a second look after life's made you beat,"Bought my copy at City Lights bookstore in San Francisco during a cross-country road trip in 1997. Couldn't get into the novel. Very scattershot, I felt then, and while far more readable than Burroughs found myself wondering if this had any point.Cut to 2002, summer. I pick up my yellowing copy which I've for some reason kept. I begin again, reading in the morning while guzzling coffee and waiting for caffeine/inspiration to come and lift me up. I am so taken by Kerouac's journey I underline phrases.And I realize On The Road is not a novel so much as a long-form poem in the style of Walt Whitman. Read it as such. It speaks to anyone who's lost the first blush of youth, feels everyday 9-to-5 Life is not just a drag but Purgatory, loves the America to be found between here and there, insanity, gone little ladies, and who fights the Beat fight to be childlike and pure when cynicism is the new Hip."
3,Heavy Duty Shower Curtain Liner,I wanted a heavy duty shower curtain liner and was tired of buying ones that didn't last long. This shower curtain liner is strong and heavy. It has lasted longer than other shower curtain liners I have had but I still get mildew buildup just the same amount as the cheaper ones in the stores. I don't think it is mildew resistant.
2,hollow guilty reading,"Enjoying Bright Lights, Big City (20 years ago), and after seeing decent reviews for this, I looked forward to reading the Good Life.On the positive side, it was a quick read, whose soap opera story lines (that's the guilty part)and sound storytelling keeps you involved and pushing forward. But, as an earlier reviewer pointed out, it becomes played out as a modern version of the Great Gatsby where the shallow characters become people you could care less about, and the dialog between those characters becomes increasingly abysmal. If you do read it, the telephone exchanges between the two primary characters is particularly painful."
3,The Gospel of John - Visual Bible,"I think that the movie follows scripture very well. I sat with my Bible NIV and followed along. The version used was not much different. Only placement of some of the words. Basicly it is scriptural. The one thing that I find in the film is the portrate of Jesus. Ian Cusac did a good job in his portral until it came to the exibition of his body. I don't think Jesus would have walked around with his chest completely exposed as the actor does. There are several scenes where the actors tunic is completly opened to the waist. People in that part of the country, then and now, wore robes and wraps to hide the body and I don't think Jesus would have been an exibitionist as portrayed in the movie. In that respect I was disappointed in the movie."
4,Great series for a range of yoga capabilities.,"I got this series for a friend's birthday after she checked the Fire DVD out from the library & loved it. I've done the Earth & Water videos with her & I think they're great. Very instructional. They really made me pay attention to my posture & I realigned myself several times after realizing I wasn't getting the most out of a pose. I have't attempted the Fire one yet, my friend said it was pretty intense! But I think the other 2 are suitable for someone at any level of experience."
5,Great work!,Got it in good time and in good condition. I am quite satisfied! It will be a great Christmas present for my Dad!
2,Not Worthy,"I purchased this book after I bought ""Ex Girl to the Next Girl"" and realized that it was a sequel so I had to get ""Got a Man"". First off the writer's style is a little too junior high for my taste. I have to agree with the reviewer that said if you are over 30 then DON'T BUY this book. Ms. Poole uses elementary school vocabulary, short sentences and tends to repeat herself (Ex: I hate Malik, he's so stupid I wish he would die, I hate Malik he's stupid"". Now if that doesn't sound junior high I don't know what does. If your looking to read something shallow then by all means buy this book. However, if you are looking for a juicy story with a more sophisticated style of writing then try reading books by Mary Morrison or Lolita Files."
4,Connemara in the rain,Poetic account of one Canadian's experience of life on a small island - Inishturk - in the far west of Ireland. The miseries of winter - 'the terrible frosts and the sly damp...making old fractures of wrist and pelvis ache' soon shatter illusions. And 'the house where the drowned man lived has been empty four winters.'They say that seals are ghosts of the drowned. Plenty hereabouts!
4,GPS Review,"I was surpised at how easy it is to use the Garmin. It proved its worth last weekwhen we had a lot of traveling from one location to another on Long Island N.Y. and there were Nor'Easters on two days so we could not see the exit signs. The Garmin made it very easy to know when we coming up to the exist and especially when to stay to the left or right lanes.Ocasionally it would get confused and give us invalid directions. Yesterday when traveling from my house to my cousin's house in Eastern Mass., at distance of 31 miles, the GPS could not get the satellite and thought that we were still in the Bronx, N.Y."
2,Not for Beginners,"As a teacher in the Oracle Internet Academy, I can attest to the fact that this book is NOT for beginners. The publishers would have you believe that a complete novice can learn Java with this course, yet the book makes regular references to other programming languages. A colleague of mine has supplemented his course with the ""Dummies"" book, and he says that it covers the material in a more ""beginner oriented"" way. I came into the class with no programming experience, and after reading the book 4 times I am looking for more help. Maybe it's just me, but I don't think so."
3,Not sufficient for exam,"I have little experience with SQL Server 7. After taking a class and reading a book, I then used the Readiness Review to determine whether I was ready for the exam. According to my scores on the Review, I was ready. But the exam I took did not look anything like the questions in the book. The exam was far more difficult than what I expected based on this book. So it's back to studying... both BOL and yet another book on SQL Server admin."
2,not bad,"i must say, i enjoyed the concept of this story and while it managed to capture my interest for most of the time, it kept losing me due to grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, overdone description of events (i.e. solemnly solemn) and a patchy storyline that almost got it right but not quite. having read huggins's nightbringer i was expecting a whole lot better"
2,pretty dull,"i am very disappointed in this book. after all the rave reviews i read i was expecting much more. its just rather dull. the language is stilted so it sometimes hard to figure out what they are talking about. the characters are rather flat and the ""plot"" is just not intereting. i loved white teeth but could not get through her 2nd novel. i am barely making it through this and going to the book often feels like a chore that needs to be completed. she is clearly a gifted and intelligent person but with regard to this book ... ""there is just no there, there"""
3,Actually OK,"Written and directed by the man who wrote ""Heathers"", ""Happy Campers"" retains a few elements of that movie, such as voice-overs, a reference to Drano, and blue-tinted woods.However, where ""Heathers"" was a clever landmark film, ""Happy Campers"" is a just-OK, entertaining movie. It has enough humor in the usual teen-oriented jokes (bodily fluids/functions, sex and breasts), and pretty good looking women, to make it an enjoyable film.It is not really appropriate for younger teens, hence the ""R"" rating. No Oscar nominations in sight, but it could be much worse."
4,Good compounding reference,"This book helped me complete many pre-lab assignments. I found the calculations to be a little hard to follow once in a while, but overall a good reference."
1,This video is a waste of time and money,"This vidoe lack focus, purpose, and direction. There is far to much ""tutorial"" content which does little to support the video title."
1,'Heavy debunking by Korf,This is no objective analysis of the Billy Meier case. Korf does a lot of mudslinging and debunking. I have a lot of insight into this case and I believe that Britt and Lee Elders did the definive investigation many years ago. The conclusion of Elders was that Billy Meiers photos and films were genuine after have been analyzed in laboratories in USA.It is my firm belief after viewing the evidence that Billy Meier has indeed been contacted by a woman from the Pleiades called Semjase.
3,Wonderful commentary; Not very practical,"Ideally, this should be the Conservative answer to the Artscroll prayerbooks. And it tries to be. The commentary is detailed and insightful, drawing from the vast spectrum of Jewish thought and literature. Lots of different points of view. A fantastic job in this respect.I was looking for a siddur for my own use (reflecting Conservative interpretations), similar to the Artscroll. But ""Or Hadash"" is not very practical for this purpose. It reprints exactly the Sim Shalom prayer book, but in VERY small print. The commentary overtakes the actual prayers it surrounds on the page, and it looks and reads more like a textbook than a usable siddur. Contrary to the previous reviewer's comments, there are no ""synagogue choreography instructions"" beyond what was in Sim Shalom originally. Unfortunately, here the Artscroll wins out.I hope to see a true Conservative version of the Artscroll siddur some day soon."
4,put your faucet within reach,"I needed to get my faucet away from the house and have space for attaching hoses. This simple solution did the trick. Because it is plastic and light weight, a tug on the hose can pull it out of the ground, but nothing is harmed. If I needed a more permanent solution, I would pay the higher price for a metal faucet that could be more permanently secured. But for my needs, this is sufficient."
1,Terrible and Silly,"I picked this up just like every other woman thinking that it would be a funny book about how to live gracefully. I was wrong! This book basically states that you are fabulous if you always are in a bad relationship, sleep around a lot (or are always ready to), and have no morals at all. In every chapter of the book there was some mentioning about sex and even a whole chapter devoted to it. It was like reading a script from Sex and the City. Don't let the words ""Fabulous girl"" and ""Decorum"" fool you into thinking that this book is about fabulous girls who are well behaved. It is actually about how to live a pathetic life and have no respect for yourself. Oh, and have whiny friends."
4,THE book to have on this topic,"This is an authoritative and complete manual on the ju-no-kata (forms of gentleness). The photos and text make each move and each technique clear for both tori and uke. It is a technical manual useful for a judo student studying this form, or for anyone interested in the author since it includes a section with her photo album.The author is the foremost authority in the world on this Kodokan kata. I wish it had been expanded even more from the original version previously published in Born for the Mat. The author's insights are valuable and it is good to have them recorded in this book."
3,Portfolio Keeping.,"Used for class, what else is needed to know about it. Item as described! ! ! ! ! ! !"
5,Great Series!,"This is a terrific series done by HBO and Tom Hanks! If you enjoyed Apollo 13 of the Right Stuff, this is will become one of your favorites, too!"
5,Great for the hard of hearing,"I got this for my brother-in-law who is a nursing home resident. He is very hard of hearing and it works just great. The light, indicating an incoming call, is an added benefit for him. I have tried other phones for him, but this is the best by far. A very quality item."
2,Failed Horror Comedy!,"This movie is just a chain of misfires all the way through. It doesn't work as a horror or suspense movie, but Helen Mirren's over the top performance makes it almost work as a black comedy. Katie Holmes has talent, and has made some good movies (The Ice Storm, Go) but needs to make better career decisions. Helen Mirren is too good an actress for this role, but she ultimately saves the movie. Other than Mirren's performance and a good 'Exorcist' impression by Marisa Coughlan the movie features not much else. From a scale of 1-10 I give this movie a 4!"
5,lost and found,"I recently found this album while rummaging through the hidden pocket of an old bag. I knew it was missing, I just couldn't place it. It actually bothered me at times. Let's just put it this way....I am very pleased that I've recovered it. Such a good album. Upbeat, light and airy. Easy listening with a Ben Folds-esque vibe. Love it."
1,Don't get it!,"I chose to purchase this DVD based on other reviews, and that he received good reviews for his appearance on the Three Amigos DVD (comedy with Carlos Mencia/Freddy Soto). TOTALLY don't get how this got even 1 star...let alone 4 and 5! Maybe I'm just getting old! :) My 18 and 20 year old found it funny...but me and my husband just didn't get it."
4,good,"there are many types of music that many different people enjoy. for this particualar type of music i think that it is pretty good. it gives you a good vibe. like you can sit in a cafe and chill to most of the music. it makes you feel close to home. like said before it gives you a little ""blend of bowie, liz phair,and a little ricky martin to boot (loki productions nyc)."" but overall it is ver different but different=good. so i give it 4 stars."
2,Time Bomb,"I bought this router around March 2003. No problems with installation and I have been very happy with the speed, running three machines on it.In late December, I noticed that my connection speed was down significantly. After working through my cable internet provider's technical support, they pointed me to the router. I called LinkSys and was told I needed to update the firmware. Hours of frustration later, the thing is 'dead in the water'.I undertsand that the this is a common problem over time. Now I am looking at what to replace this with. Be aware that you may buying a time bomb - may work for a while then die."
3,works great,Will not work on Windows XP...Drivers are not available yet.but it worked on my other computer which had Windows ME.Like the slim design.
5,a Rancid Fan,"I've been waiting months for this album. I got it the first day it came out and I'm very impressed with it. You never really know what to expect from the Rancid crew because every new album is different and fresh, but always good. Tim Armstrong is very creative and it shows here. This is Ska/Reggae with an two-tone groove. If you like most Rancid albums you'll probably like this. One great thing about Armstrong is his amazing ability to write lyrics. And this album has some good ones, especially track 9 ""Among the Dead"" is about his time with Ska/Punk Pioneers Operation Ivy. And things that happened after they broke up. Anyway great music, great lyrics from a very talented individual. This is an A+ album and I've been waiting for the Rancid crew to come up with something like this for a while now and I'm very Pleased. Highly recommended."
3,funny to little children. Breastfeeding is not showed.,"The book is really funny, specially for little children. I think that bottlefeeding is showed as the only possibility. Breastfeeding is important and the book has no place to mention it, because mother is not there to feed her baby."
2,Not what I expected...,"I was totally disappointed with this product...I purchased this for my high school aged son and I when I started going through it myself, I actually felt like a dupe for buying it in the first place. First off, this program it not tutorial by any means and it assumes a fair amount of chemistry background. The haphazard presentation of subject matter is more like a trivia game then a serious approach to learning chemistry. I'm not letting my son touch this software - my opinion only - but I could easily imagine a beginner picking this software up and becoming so intimidated by chemistry as to develop a mental block about it."
4,SWEET EASY READ,This is a SWEET romantic story about finding faith hope and love IN the charming English village Gresham. Predictable yet entertaining read.
3,Needs more height adjustment settings... only two.,"My daughter is 5 months old and can barely reach the ground with her tippy toes on the lowest setting. I saw that this is height adjustable, but little did I know it only has two settings and both of them are extremely tall. It says 4months and above so I figured that it would be talking about average babies but its definitely too tall and Mylinn is a little longer than normal. The toys are simple but thats fine especially for the cheap price we paid, but what good is it if she can't reach the ground to walk in it. The product itself is great I think, exactly as described, but they need to include a height minimum for this or more adjustable settings."
5,A sturdy educational gift,"My daughter received this as a gift when she was ten months old. Within a few days of receiving it she could put all the pieces back where they belonged without help. She also learned to identify receptively square, triangle, and circle from this puzzle by the time she was one. The wooden case is also very sturdy, I have actually caught her standing on it and it didn't break, thank God! The case makes it nice to store the puzzles neatly. Don't expect the child to be able to put the completed puzzles back into the case themselves though. She played with this toy often until about 18 mo old when she moved onto harder puzzles. A good toy that lasts a while."
4,Language,I loved it. Sometimes it seemed to drag on about nothing. But it dragged on beautifully I must say. It was the first Nin book I read and now I am on a binge. I loved her use of language and I related a lot to this book. It made me do some serious thinking.
1,do not recommend this company,"I do not recommend this company to buy a pda from. They have terrible customer service. I purchased a pda for my husband for Christmas and when he received it, it would not work and it would not sit in the charger, it had to be held in the holder. My husband called the company, but they would not help him. He shipped it back the same day he received it. Their return policy is within 72 hours and we sent it back within that time period and I also contacted them through email about wanting my money back and they did not send a response to my email and I have not received my money back for it either. I would never do business with this company again and would hope that no one else would either. I would not want anyone else to be cheated out of their money the way I was."
3,Goooodish,"I bought these bath toys for my daughter who is 6 months old and she just LOVES them! They are light and easy for her to handle and throw around when out of the tub and in the tub she enjoys watching me fill them up with water and squirt it out. The one thing I do not like about these is there is no real way to sanatize them before giving them to my child, I tried to boil them in water like I do with her other toys but it just melted away some of the coloring, I actually had to throw one of them away because I wasn't going to let her chew on something that had paint peeling... Other than that I think they are very good for a baby still learning how grasp toys."
2,2 1/2 stars,"The heroine in this book was just not that likable. She complained too much. Also, there was no passion in this story. It was like, 'Oh, there's a connection between these two people? Really? When did that develop?'The story just wasn't interesting as well. I never really understood the plot, partly because I was so bored reading this that I was only half paying attention. I liked Jared though in the love scenes; his dialogue is sexy. But the story was flat so I couldn't fully enjoy them. I only really enjoy books under Amanda Quick, sometimes some under Jayne Ann Krentz, but this one was just not as good as her usual books."
5,Stunning operatic performance and composition,I heard a review of this opera on NPR and was hooked. I bought it completely on a whim. I'm thrilled with what I got. Golijov blends several different musical tradtions to create stunning new music. Hwang's libretto beautfully illustrates the characters' passion. The opera is about an actress who worked with Spanish playwright Federico Lorca before his death at the hands of the facsist party. The opera illustrates how she made peace with her actions since his death. A beautiful story that will hopefully remind us how important freedoms of pen and speech really are.
2,menage a trois,"La regla de tres es la historia de las relaciones entre una mujer y dos hombres, formando un triangulo amoroso, y las complicaciones y reflexiones que surgen de esta relacion. Personalmente creo que no es lo mejor que ha escrito Gala. La exotica historia de La pasion turca o Mas alla del jardin lo superan con creces."
3,Smack Down! 2: Know Your Role,"My 12 yr. old son, a die hard wrestling fan, begged me to purchase this game for him. I'm glad I did, he LOVES it. He has just about every wrestling game that has come out. According to him, the game is a lot of fun."
1,"Product is fine, just think the movie is boring","The Losers was my friend's favorite movie, but I just thought it was a typical action movie meant for guys. Basically a male version of a chick-flick."

1,broke in less then 4 hours,this train failed in less then four hours of use--never heard back from the company when i asked if i could return it for a refund or replacement
5,Don't Even Go Near a Courtroom Without It!,"This is the single most useful psych resource I've ever used, and I have a pretty extensive library. The explanations of some of the internal features of the MMPI-II were impressive and helpful even to a Ph.D. psychologist with 30 years' clinical experience! Unless you have a graduate degree in psychology, this book is your best bet for mounting an effective challenge to bad, sloppy, or harmful psychological testing."
3,It's OK,it's reasonable product even though there is better one with a little more expensive.np problem at all with price I paid.
5,A new take on Verse Anthems,"I just listened to this compilation for the first time, expecting to hear another re-hashing of these beloved tunes done by a fine ensemble (and completely devoid of character!). However, this is not the typical domesticated Men and Boys rendetion you might be accustomed to.Red Byrd utilizes not only pronunciation appropriate to the period, but sings these pieces in a manner more like shaped note American tunes. It is, at first, a bit off-putting. However if one bears with it the pieces spring to life in a new way. In no piece is this more striking than ""This is the Record of John"". The rendetion heard here of the solo line becomes less pious and righteous, and a bit more tongue in cheek with John's repeated ""no"" answer to the questions asked of him by the Temple elders.A must! I know of no other disk quite like this."
1,No Twisted Ends!,"I wanted short speaker wire with TWISTED ENDS! This was a total wast of money, since it had no ends at all."
4,The Walkers in their prime,"If you were a fan of the Walkers Brothers before Scott took off for strange-land you'll enjoy this album. It's really the only one you need to buy. It has the three 60's mega hits-Sun Ain't, Make It Easy,and My Ship. It also contains some great little knowns and B sides like Another Tear Falls,Saddest Night In the World, and some other super tear in your beer entries. If you want to dig deeper into Scott's pre-Prozac world thanby all means spring for more lp's but this one does the job quite well."
2,260 minutes of fluff,"really there are better things that you can do with 2 hours and 40 minutes....read a book, rake your yard, call an old friend....on the other hand you can get poor acting, poor directing, a laughable script that will have you shaking your head by watching Troy, you decide."
5,A Powerful Read,"I've read several young adult novels that deal with school violence and this is really the first one that I feel truly delves into the mind of one of the perpetrators in a realistic way. Paul Richmond could be someone we know, he could be us. Flinn has the courage to remind us that violence doesn't happen in a vacuum, that all of us have a Breaking Point and that many times, our smaller cruelties may be pushing someone else to their Breaking Point. As we follow Paul through his downward spiral we are forced to look at these issues in our own homes and classrooms and wonder, who we know, who is at the edge, who is ready to break. This is a must read for kids and for teachers, too."
5,Love this sturdy princess castle,"I bought this for my daughter's 4th birthday and it has been a hit ever since - she plays with it daily. It is extremely sturdy, though the string on the drawbridge broke the first day, it just stays down and hasn't affected play or my view of the toy. I looked everywhere for accessories for this and ended up buying more of the Disney Princess sets (she already had quite a few) and it seems to be more than enough. Apparently, no furniture or anything is needed, just some princesses, princes, and her imagination! I would definitely recommend this."
5,Sterilite Corp. 6418006 2Pc White Dish Drainer,I could not locate this item in too many stores and never could find this size. It's a great item and fits on the sink counter perfect. The cost is great also.
3,Not what I expected,"When I bought the anthology, I expected to read about five women living their lives on the street. However, as I read the memoirs, I realized that my views of the homeless population were quite narrow and only identified with the stereotypical views associated with them. While a few of the memoirs did reinforce some of the negative characteristics tied to the homeless, it did also make me realize that homelessness can result from events completely out of a person's control. Overall, I felt that this collection of works was somewhat insightful, but it did not have a profound affect on me."
2,Not my cup of tea either...,"The author has the POTENTIAL to be really good. In fact, it is almost as if two different people wrote different parts of this book. I found the Martin/Rachel storyline to be fairly decent reading.Unlike the master reviewer, I didn't have any trouble understanding the quote he provided. However, there was plenty else I didn't understand, and more importantly didn't care, about.I also question why the author waited until around 120 pages into the book to explain the Eschaton to us clearly.Overall, I'd skip this book. It was my first for Charles Stross and I don't think I will give him another try.-Tom"
1,Not as it appears,"I purchased this product on March 17th. I didn't receive it until the end of the first week of April. When it arrived the balls were either blue or orange. NOT the ""traditional billiard ball colors"" as the description reads. I waited 3 weeks and paid a lot for these (as a gift for my husband) that now has to be returned.However, the product IS solid. Good balls and good paint/art job. If you want all blue/orange balls then this is the set for you."
3,"Good Music, Too Much cursing!","I purchased this CD after listenting to their latest CD ""Closer than Veins"" hoping it was as good. When i got the CD in mail their was a parental advisory sticker on it that i was not aware of before purchasing. I was able to salvage only two songs without any cursing ""aicha & guantanamo"" great songs. their latest CD i already mentioned is much better byfar. these artist are very talented and I hope they keep their next album clean."
2,marred by poor singing,"not a good recording. The singing is really not at the level that one would expect on a professional recording. several of the singers have very noticeable wobbles. there is another recording of this opera that came out of bologna, i've never heard it, but i would give that one a try before this one."
3,"Too long, too cold, too bad","The cold, clinical, drum-machined production makes all but a few of these songs sound sterile and lifeless, which is a shame because underneath all the electronic goop there are some good ones trying to get out. It's not awful, but the guy who recorded LAYLA is nowhere to be found"
4,Have only played demo,"There are points about this game that I both liked and disliked.Liked: Really nice graphics, duel weapons useage, bullet time, the creepy/action music score.Disliked: Long load times, having to turn left and right with the mouse (!?), some of the hoakey-sounding narations with the FMV sequences.I ran the demo on a PIII 800 with 128 RAM and a GF2. For the most part the graphics and audio were stable with only one momentary skip.I own another PC with PIII 850, 256 RAM, and an ATI Rage Mobility 128. I have yet to play the demo on this system, but all of my other graphics-intesnive games have played better on this machine than the other.If you are going to buy this game, I would hope you have a system with a semi-decent video card and lots of RAM. (256mb at least)"
1,I didn't finish this because...,"by the time I got to page 200 by brain felt like it had been deprived of oxygen and I just couldn't take it anymore. The book's idea was interesting, but it just wasn't well executed. The characters, dialogue, plot, and pacing were terrible. I could go on for hours about all of it's faults. Don't waste your time with it."
3,Shipping?,"I can't believe I was so stupid! Where was my head when I ordered three boxes of K-Cups, and agreed to $15.00 for shipping? I will never do that again! I'm definately going to pay more attention from now on! And I'll never order from ""Stay at home Mom"" again.I know I like the coffee, but I can get the same deal at full retail locally."
2,Tango In The Night,This is A easy listen project from Fleetwood Mac.The best song is Seven Wonders preformed by Stevie Nicks.
4,awesome,This book made me think... think alot. (and it made me feel like talking too) It was so... descriptive about everything! I could imagine what was going on right in my mind. It was like watching a movie... no.... it was like i was standing right there with her. Very cool!
2,"Most of this box set is crap, - for very old fans only.","You would have to be an very ardent JP fan to like this box-set. The music covers literally their whole career. But, most of the tracks from the 70's and 80's are crap to listen to now. The live concert is okay at the most. Priest are doing something similar to VH and re-releasing their old records in different compilations. JP used to be a good metal band, but their music is tiresome now. R.I.P. Judas Priest."
2,Do not buy for skis,The bars are much too far apart for skis to be secure. It would probably work for a snowboard. I used the Rubbermaid Utility Hooks instead and they work much better for skis.
5,Great Filter,"After buynig several filters over the years this is a very well made unit. The material of the lid is thin, but so what. All it does is keep dust out and help with evaporation. It works fine. Of the other reviews that is is noisy all I can say is mine is very quite and you have to look at the water to see that it is running.(I have heard noisy ones this isn't) I have a 36 gal. bow front and the fact you can tone down the flow at feeding time is a plus or if you have some delicate friends it's very usfull. If your looking for a new filter I recomend this one, also like the 3 filtering masses so you don't loose all your good bacteria when you do a cleaning. I don't write reviews but thought this one was worth it buying this was helped by other reviews which some of the bad ones could not have been more wrong! IMHO Very happy!!! Or you could buy a canister that will cost many times this price!"
3,Get the WB Greatest Hits/Misses If Your On a Budget,"If your a Spud down on your luck and on a budget, get the WB Greatest Hits/Misses, you'll get over 30 of their songs on 2 used CD's for about the price of this one alone. If you're not on a budget than get all their WB releases, its worth it! There are a lot of great songs that they didn't have room for."
3,"Good overall fit, but a little billowy despite the velcro fasteners","I thought this was going to be a bit more fitted to my grill. Unless I really tighten the velcro fasteners, the cover drage on teh ground."
2,Impractical,I was disappointed in the cookbook. We are not gourmet cooks. I assume many of the recipes are from the restaurant the chef runs. I was looking for a down-to-earth guide to nutrition for an amateur triathlete. Sorry Chris I like your other books but not this one. Can I get a refund?
3,GAME IS LAME!!! W/O 50 Cent,"Ok, people need to stop acting as if GAME would be as hot if he wasnt signed under G Unit for his 1st Album. I mean, look at the other scrap albums he dished out and got NO LOVE.GAME is LAME b/c he was all on 50's lap before he blew up. After he got a little fame he tried to blow up on 50 the way 50 did on a lot of other Cats in the Rap game. The difference: ""Never bite the hand that feeds you.."""
2,Not performing up to expectations,"I purchased this unit in November 2007. It is now December of the same year and the ""hold"" button will not release after it has been depressed until I turn the unit off. So now when my mouth fills with water, I have to turn the unit off to stop the stream of water, expel the water from my mouth, turn the unit back on and continue in this fashion until finished.The other problem I've noticed is the pressure starts out very weak and usually doesn't build until the water in the tank is about half gone.I expected more from the Waterpik Ultra, but based on it's performance thus far, I would not recommend it."
4,A beautiful collection of accoustic country/bluegrass tunes,"There seems to be some controversy about this country flavoured album by Bill Frisell. If you are focused on buying good ""jazz"" you may be disappointed. If you are focused on good music, this is a fine choice. My already high respect for Frisell rose when I heard him play this country/bluegrass music (under the title ""Nashville"" may I point out) showing nothing but respect for this genre of music that is so often dismissed. Amazingly, Frisell is able to make an album that sounds like straight country/bluegrass and still have it sound like a Bill Frisell album.I am a musician, but not a guitar player. I don't know how hard the guitar playing is here, but it sure is beautiful. If you are into jazz and want to expand your tastes, this not a bad place to start."
2,This is not a very good book,"This book contains some interesting nuggets, and the depth of Stalin's evil is truly difficult to grasp. But this book is a train of thought, totally disorganized, apparently unedited at all. If you dislike Stalin, you'll really, really dislike him after this read. But with so much undigested trivia you'll be lucky to learn much of anything. Read ""People's Tragedy"" by Orlando Figes. It stops before Stalin is fleshed out, but does a much better job of laying the groundwork for how such a limitlessly brutal regime could exist. Lenin was no piker, either."
4,"Good movie, good service","It came a couple of days before it said it would, which is good because it was a Christmas present."
3,Shoo,I had it shipped internationally and Homeland Security made me pay.Something about the container being a risk.In the aftermath I am still saying Shoo Bug...
3,its kinda like the exorcist,"So the first thing you see is this dude doing his daughter and the last thing you see is like that dudes wife spraying her milk across the room and peeing onthe floor like in the Exorcist while that dude is outside in the greenhous like having sex with a dead chick.Yeah, its just as good as it sounds. i laughed real hard like the whole time its funnier than Bio Dome, you know. It's like the time when i told my friend to rent bio Dome but he rented some movie called Airplane instead? and i was all ""Dude, where's biodome and he was all ""airplane's funnier than Bio dome dude"" and we watched Airplane and when it was over i was like ""dude that was so not funnier than bio dome"" and he was all ""Shut Up Tad!"" and were not freinds anymore.Faschcist. I hate fascists."
3,An Acceptable Recording Device,"The Philips AQ635517 Cassette Recorder Player is something you can rely on for recording notes and reminders. The microphone is perfect for small time recording. I use it for song writting ideas, if I have an idea for a song that could be good I have something around to use to record it. It is excellent for it size."
2,A mecha-sized letdown...,"Slowdown? On the Dreamcast? In just the intro even? This isn't right, but it's the truth.""Slave Zero"" could have done so many things right and ended up doing so much wrong. With overly linear maps, a graphics engine that crumbles to a grinding halt when any significant number of enemies is on the screen and quite possibly the worst multiplayer I've seen in a long time, the only reason to pick up ""Slave Zero"" is if you are a total mech otaku and see it really, really, really cheap."
2,Be a Happier Camper,This bag's not the best. Get item # CBSSUNV directly from Camp Chef for 23.99 + S&H. Fits all CC Sport Utility models.
2,"premise great, writing one-dimensional","Don't I wish that judges were as un-clever as the clowns depicted in this story.Sorry to report that truly biased judges, which includes many but not most, are much better at hiding their biases otherwise they would be subject to disqualification and perhaps removal.I did like the idea of a civil trial to recover damages from a theocratic government like Saudi Arabia's - but it all could have been set out and developed so much better.To the reviewers who compare this author to Grisham - not hardly."
1,Disgusting,"Like everybody else here, I found the first two Shrek movies to be entertaining. The second one was my favorite, since I thought its writing was the best of all three. But this one...ugh. It was just plain gross. There's too much bathroom humor. Who would want to see a movie full of burping, farting, butt jokes, and explicit depictions of vomiting? Not me. AVOID this movie, especially if you are sensitive to vulgarity. (In comparison, the first two movies did not have nearly as much crude humor as this one -- they were much more serious, which is why I enjoyed them more.)"
1,"Yet Another So Called ""Classic"" Overrated Alcoholic Writer!!!",In this book we see the struggle of a fisherman against a big marlin fish. Many reknown Literary Critics have suggested that this was a metaphor for Hemingway's own battle with Depression and Alcoholism. Most biographers of Hemingway have also suggested that his drinking excesses exacerbated his Depression which is why his books are often of differing quality. Sadly Hemingway shot almost every living animal on this planet until the only thing left to shoot was himself. No doubt had he lived he would have enrolled in a Twelve Step Programme (that's the correct Australian spelling of that word by the way) for alcoholics and 28 days in Rehab just like his Grandaughter the beautiful but highly unstable Margaux Hemingway.
5,"Very Interesting Song, Sung Sweetly","La Rosa is a cute song in which a girl protests mistreatment by men who cheat and then send the girl roses. The song goes on to depreciate the rose as a flower grown with manure (estericol)! Both the English and Spanish version are a pleasure to listen to. I like the tune and the singer's expression. Litzy doesn't show any detectable Spanish accent in the English version. The song is amusing as it proceeds to badmouth other commonly thought desirable things, like the butterfly is just an insect. The most recent song that Litzy has produced is (& I have heard) is Pecadora, a song that should have been the theme song for the telenovela of the same name, a song posted on YouTube.Litzy is an excellent actress whose best performance is probably as protagonist of Amarte Asi, a telenovela for which she also sings the theme song, as she did for Daniela, another of her telenovelas."
2,Out of date,I bought it due to the recommendations given on this very website and it was definitely informative but this book is in DIRE need of updating. Korea is changing VERY FAST and 1997 was before the current President (who is stepping down this month) was elected into office!
2,Quick read,Blink flies by too fast. It was to me like reading a series of newpaper articles. But very interesting nevertheless.
4,I enjoyed this video very much!,"If you like Science Fiction, you'll really like this one. What is the Airzone Solution? It is a solution to a problem. The dialog at the end is really quite convincing. It sounds like a good solution to a problem. It is a lesson in politics, something that will make you think. If you like Science Fiction shows like Doctor Who, Twilight Zone, and Outer Limits, this one will take you somewhere similar. It is especially good if you are a Doctor Who Fan because Colin Baker and Nicola Bryant do an outstanding job, and there role together is quite different than that of Doctor Who. It demonstrates how good these actors really are, in something different and interesting. After viewing this video, I continued to think about it long after. Something like this could really happen. This video demonstrates how easy it is for all of us to be taken in by convincing words, instead of investigating the facts."
4,Good Product,"The soft case is pretty good, it is very roomy and with a nice side pocket for extra heads or whatever. I just wish I had a bigger bow, but that can changed. I recommend it too anyone being on a budget but not wanting to sacrifice quality."
5,Bipartisan Historical Pictorial Dog Book,"""Name That Dog"" is a bipartisan dog book [coffee table size] that showcases your favorite presidents, whether Democrat or Republican, with their canine companions. This book is replete with historical photographs [black & white] dating back to Rutherford B. Hayes [1897] with his favorite spaniel, ""Dot."" Also included are celebrity dogs [Bob Hope with ""My dog"", Joan Rivers with ""Spike,"" Phyliss Diller with ""Phearless""] and many others ...If you like dogs and history, this book makes a great gift item!"
2,Uncomfortable,"This ring might be ok for someone with long fingers.its a very large looking ring for someonr with shorter fingers.i could not put my fingers together.the size runs a bit large also.does not look real,but I can see it being ok as a fun ring.this was not for me I have the wrong type of fingers for it."
2,I've yet to find a Bluetooth headset that works.....,"I've tried the Jabra, several models of the Jawbone and a couple of other devices. I've yet to find something that works well and fits comfortably. I must have weirdly shaped ear canals because I cannot get one of these to fit in a way that I don't have to push it into my ear and hold it there to hear what the other person is saying; even on high volume."
3,it sure would be great if they would put the price back to what it was this morning!,"The price for 125ft was $[...] and shipped for free! Here this morning!$[...] what the hell is this crap?Thanks for nothing.Other info about the product;flux tube is plastic.. not sure it does anything good but when you spread the bundles and cut the ""flux tube"" it makes the wire easily fit in terminals!Despite the glossy finish, it is extremely flexible!"
4,Great book with jagged layout,"This is a well written though brief historical overview of the early years of the German nightfighter force in WW2. For its compact (less than 100 9"" x 12"" pages) size, there are lots of great pictures, color illustrations, biographies, anectdotal accounts, and techical descriptions of the men and equipment that comprised the Nachtjagd. My only complaint is that the number of these sidebars which sometimes are as large as three pages, interrupt the reading of the historical narrative which is actually the most interesting part of the book. One of the primary purposes of this series seems to be to clarify and illustrate the color, camouflage and markings of the aircrafts used by the Luftwaffe. To that end I would like to see more than just profiles of the aircraft which are illustrated. There also seem to be a few tiny errors in the identification of aircraft, but overall I am very happy with this book and would highly recomend it to anyone, especially scale modelers."
1,Doesn't measure up to the other Chris Moore's novels,"""Lust Lizard"" lacks the elements that made Moore's other four novels so good: complex characters (human AND non-human), interesting story with lots of twists, unpredictable ending, great humor, soft-cover price.I am extremely disappointed, but still look forward Moore's next one. If we're lucky it will be up there with Blood-Sucking Fiends or Coyote Blue."
4,What can you say...,"They are nuts and bolts. They fit right and they don't cost too much. Not much more one needs to say about a hand full of nuts and bolts, but they are as good as any. The tops of the bolt heads are painted white, so if you don't want white, you should buy something else."
1,Break failed and dog almost got hit by a car,"The break feature failed and the leash did not retract as my puppy was crossing the street, he almost got hit by a car. I contact the company and they said they would send me a new leash immediately and it would arrive in 1 week. It had been 5 weeks and no leash. I would not recommend this leash. Go with another company."
5,~~~~~,"G. Bernard Shaw was a great playwright and that is the reason why his plays tend to outshine his novels. Nonetheless, this is a five-star novel and it should not be so hard-to-get."
2,Too complicated,"This kit is for more experienced ""beaders"". The patterns are not easy to make and there aren't enough jingles. But my kids liked the concept."
2,A major disappointment,"I only give this two stars because of Marisa Mell otherwise it would only get one. The film itself is not a giallo despite claims to the contrary. Worst of all is the quality of the transfer. It looks like it was made off of a VHS dupe. Terrible! MYA should be ashamed of themselves for even releasing this. To add insult to injury, the trailer on the DVD has better color and is English language, which is obviously how the film was shot. The movie itself is in Italian with English subtitles."
1,Bad service,"I placed an order for the Elk Lighting 1703 12, however they canceled it the same day. Why post it as in stock when it is not?"
5,Hot Big Band jazz,"A tremendous contribution to the Big Band jazz tradition, this CD proves that the genre is still vibrant and meaningful for today's musicians and audiences. Two thumbs up - outstandingly tight performances all the way around."
2,FUN & DUMB,"This is a great song that you'll listen to all the time for a week. After that you'll get really sick of it, I promise!!!!!!!"
2,More In-Depth Please!,I found the book very shallow and typical. The book barely scratches the surface of this complex subject. Definately NOT worth the money.
4,Thought-provoking read,"Read this book as a book club selection. I found it be a very provoking read. The imagery used in the book is beautiful and truly adds to the understanding of the characters and the enjoyment. The book is a solid, gripping read and one that is hard to put down."
5,Great story --,"This movie will be one I will remember. It had great acting, and a believable storyline. Great drama, sheds light on the politcal scene many of us here about but never see. Not 100% believeable but it is close."
3,Twang eases muffle,"RS light a match instantaneously with their debut's first, and by far most powerful, melodic theme and spend the rest the album recuperating from that height, only rallying enough energy for the obligatory climax."
4,"Great sound, but ...","About 5-6 years ago, I purchased a similar product from Etymotics. Although the wires were a bit fragile (I got warranty repair once), the sound and sound-isolation was so good that it made up for the deficiency. Then, I purchased an iPhone and of course the headphone jack wouldn't seat properly. That's a well-known fact about (at least first-generation) iPhones. So imagine my surprise when I get this new model and the jack STILL doesn't fit into my iPhone! I just purchased an adapter, but that's a pain. I've purchased earbuds from other manufacturers recently, and they fit my iPhone just fine. Why not the ER6i?"
2,Possibly the most boring movie with wheels ever made,"Not even as entertaining as Biker Boyz, which was a pretty lame movie in itself. It shows the speedometer's of various riders going very high, but you rarely see any shots where they're actually driving fast. Okey plot, but very stupid dialogue and exaggerated villains and stereotypes.Rent or buy ""Drive"" with Marc Damascas for a good ""high-octane"" movie."
1,I didn't care for it.,"The story didn't seem believable..the editing was questionable and I just didn't care for it. I expected much more, I can't recommend it."
3,"Great product, if it worked.","I bought this calculator on Amazon.com for my daughter who is in 8th grade. I liked the silver one because it allows for interchangeable face plates. the calculator arrived on time, but it was dead. Did not work. changed batteries. nada. changed backup battery. nada. followed all of the online trouble-shooting ideas, along with those in the manual. Nothing. Finally just went and bought one locally. Works great."
5,A true classic!,"This if my favorite installment in the Driver series. When i first put this game in the PSX and found out that the circle button was a special burnout button i was like ""oh yea, this is the best game ever!"". Yes the graphics are a little rough after playing Parallel Lines but it's still a true classic and always will be. One thing is for sure, and that is there will never bee a game with crazier cops. Try getting full felony, and getting good speed with cops a good ways behind you and slowdown really quick over the hump bridges in Miami. The cops just fly over you, its awesome. Great game. Still a favorite"
1,poorly made,"I ordered this wire wok ring.The wire was broken in two places, and very poorly made.I was very disapointed with it.My husband said he could try to fix it, but I said it's not worth it, nor wasting my time sending it back."
2,you get what you pay for,"This mouse is designed for both right and left handers. That means your left handed friend can use it without lots of pain, but that also means the other 99% of the time you use it with some pain. Its not worth it. If you are right handed go for the asymmetrically designed Intellimouse Explorer. Also, mine would skip, lag, and had other serious technical problems. It got returned..."
5,Dare To Listen,"The Human League were purveyors of the synth-pop movement of the early 80's and Dare is their landmark album. The album would be worth buying for ""Don't You Want Me"" alone. The song is an 80's (and all time) classic with its film noir lyrics and rich synthesizers. One might think of the album as a one-song wonder, but that is hardly the case. Other great tracks include ""The Sound Of The Crowd"", ""Get Carter"", ""Things That Dreams Are Made Of"", ""Love Action"" & ""Seconds"". The three-pronged vocals and dueling synths create a moody, electric piece of music."
1,shameless rip-off of coldplay,I am amazed that no one else is appalled at the fact the this band is a complete copy of Coldplay. Where's the originality?
5,Thank you K. Paterson,"I read this book years ago in grade school and it has haunted me ever since. The character portrayals, so rich and atypical, are solid reading for youngsters and adults alike. And the emotions in the story read as genuine, not trite or melodramatic as is the case with so much contemporary fiction, young adult on up. I recommend this book for children, parents and book fans in general."
5,Stay Young,"An amazing book that helps you strike a balance. This book is much appreciated among women in their mid-life. Dr. Hotze does give us some clear and useful information to remain young with his eight step program. If its depression that you are going thru all you need is to get a copy of Hormones, Health and Happiness.[...]"
1,Disappointed,"I returned these CDs because they bore no resemblance to what they were advertised to be, i.e., Patty's original recordings."
1,Disapointing video hampers film,"After the spectacular IMAX ""Super Speedway"" I looked forward to this DVD, but was sorely disappointed. Many shots have the look of being filmed a little soft, then digitally sharpened, producing a nasty ringing along edges. Also, the camera is clearly vibrating during many static shots, leaving the picture trembling and hard to watch. Moving shots are generally good, though the print shows evidence of dirt and streaks. Narration is pompous, and the attempt at narrative is like the worst educational films. Even the packaging has problems, listing chapters and times for the documentary supplement incorrectly. The only bright point was the sound, which was a quite good Dolby Digital 5.1 channel mix."
2,Only women can genuinely love,"Kawabata's 'Snow Country' is a geisha story.One of the main characters of the book, Komako, had to sell herself in order to pay the medical costs needed for the treatment of her lover's illness.One of her clients is the rich good-for-nothing Shimamura.They are attracted to each other, but love or even genuine human contact seems impossible for them.All those facts are told more or less indirectly between poetic and melancholic descriptions of snow landscapes.This novel was first published as a newspaper serial and contains some unnecessary repetitions. Also, the end is not convincing with a fire as a deus ex machina.I found this novel too vague, too impressionistic and too loose.For a more moving and realistic portrait of a geisha I recommend 'Autobiography of a Geisha' by Sayo Masuda."
5,ONE OF THE BEST CD'S OF THE YEAR,The shock of not seeing this album nor this artist nominated for a Grammy upset me because BLU was definately better than them all. I love this CD and encourage everyone to buy it and hopefully BLU will get all the attention she deserves for a slammin creation. By the way the released single (Hit Em up) doesn't compare to some of the other songs on this CD. Buy it you'll love it. When is the concert!?
2,most important part broke on 3rd use,"The third time i used the cookie press, the double threaded ring that connects the tube to the handle not only cracked but disintegrated. way beyond gluing. if i want to replace it i will have to buy another whole set -- with no assurance that the ring will not do the same again.i would like to buy a dozen replacement rings. even if it as much as a new cookie press, or more, i don't know what i'd do with a dozen cookie presses."
3,another solid zombie flick,"liked it better than 28 days. employs the newer, faster zombies. the slow ones (romero) could be used in a more 'build the suspense does she see it kind of thing, the fast ones, well more punch. less creepy more adreneline. my guess they'll shift back at some point.renner of hurt locker debut? anyway, worth the time."
3,"""Washer"" Being the Key Word","This is what is advertised, a washer. It does well with a handful of small items, tends to slop over if too full of water/clothing. Clothes come out nicely cleaned.But it only washes. It will rinse if one pours out the wash water, refills it, then turns it back on, then pours out THAT water. And of course the spin cycle is removing the clothes and twisting them manually to squeeze out excess water.Purchase only with the understanding that this washer requires lots of intervention so much so that some may prefer the sink. Other caveats: it's plastic, gives the feeling of something that can be bent out of shape or easily damaged if one is careless. Tends to vibrate a bit when at its capacity load. It can be heavy/cumbersome."
1,"Pop-OFF, not pop-on, worst toy ever had","We got this toy as a present. The train cars keep popping off when they are being moved around. The train only stays connected when not being played. I cannot believe a brand like Fisher Price would ever put this product on the market.We didn't get a gift receipt, so we are stuck with this useless toy.We have another train of the Little People toy series which is 200% better."
2,"expired coupons, little information for tourist","this book sounds great, but then you find that the coupons are expired, there is little information for the tourist and not much more information than one can find just reading a few sites online. this book is definately geared toward those tht gamble or are starting to learn to gamble, not the travel guide that many may think it to be. very disapointed."
3,Does it Work?,"Well yes, it does work, and is probably what one could expect for $59.00, but it does not come close to the claims made in the infomercial selling it for $99.00 plus shipping. Twice around a football field? Maybe if it isn't trimming grass, and the operator is running. Expect 15-20 minutes moderate cutting at full charge, and be sure to run it completely down the first few times before recharging to ""break in"" the battery. I needed it to trim a 4' highx150' long steep bank where a conventional trimmer will give your back a real work over. This it will do if you don't let the grass get too high. Its light weight and fully adjustable cutting deck are a big plus for hard to reach surfaces.I think the supplied twisted line will cut better the the solid round on the third party reels available separately, and they're 15' long also. So look at your job, and decide for yourself"
1,"Soft coating scrapes off easily, could be a health hazard.","I'm not sure what happened but this specific zyliss has a really soft coating on it. It scrapes very easily. Check out my video on youtube. Until they fix the coating issue, this gets a 1 star from me."
4,Pressure Tennis,"if you are interested in getting the most out of a tennis practice session, this book has every drill you could ever want to perform."
5,Great workout!,"After doing the Biggest Loser Cardio Max DVD for 2 weeks, I started incorporating the Power Sculpt DVD every other day. I love that there are three levels and you can customize your workout. I have lost 23 lbs. in two months and I feel great."
4,Works well,"I have an adult boxer who has separation anxiety. He will eat paper products or take articles of clothing, umbrellas, gloves, hats or chew up any boxes or plastic, whatever he can get ahold of when stressed. After a week of wearing the collar he stopped getting into things while I was at work or out for a few hours. Not to say he liked it, he would scratch at it, not sure it itched as much as he wasnt used to wearing a collar all the time. The product arrived in about 3 days after I placed the order so he has been wearing it for 4 weeks. The collar has no odor I could detect. Very happy with the product."
1,"Bad, bad movie","I don`t understand how could John Cusack, Amanda Peet and Woody Harrelson lend themselves to make such a bad movie."
2,Not a thriller like the Bourne series,"I was expecting much more from this movie. I guess I expected a lot of action similar to the Bourne movies in which Matt Damon has appeared, but I was sadly mistaken. It is an ok movie, too political and not enough action."
2,Don't bother,"If you know anything at all about voodoo, or voudou, this book will amaze you with it's focus on Santeria and/or it's focus on African voudou. Were this your first reading on the topic, you would, in all likelihood, not read anyting else. While Santeria is popular in this country, it pales in comparison to Haitian voodoo.That having been said, his adventures in New Orleans are entertaining. It just lacks most of the facts about real American Voudou!"
5,Great purchase,"As someone who likes retro things, this radio appealed to me.There were more favorable reviews than unfavorable. So, I took a chance.I am very pleased with its appearance, size and the quality of sound.If you are considering this radio, I highly recommend it."
4,Search Gloves,I read other reviews that stated the gloves ran big. So I stricly followed the sizing chart and ordered a large. The gloves arrived and were too small. I reordered an Extra Large. Gloves arrived the same exact size even though labeled XL. I emailed the company and I would be responsible for the cost of mailing them back. Now I'm out $44! Why should I have to pay postage for mis-labelled gloves? Good quality gloves!
2,Kinda cheap,"Hard to believe these are real Rockports. Was the price a giveaway?nless you wont be walking mucvh in these they are much too thin with no enough support. No padding, just the one layer of shoe upper! Not reccommended for those who plan to actually walk."
4,almost perfect,"This was exactly what my five year old grandson wanted and arrived on schedule and in near perfect condition. I was surprised to find a quarter inch of fine black powder in the bottom of the sealed box, but fortunately, it had not discolored the doll's clothing. Perhaps moisture entered the package while it was in storage and created mold? Not sure, but I would assume this was a fluke and would still recommend this product to others."
1,"Makes Me Ashamed to Be ""Green""","Thermageddon is a sterling example of the elitism that makes so many people despise environmentalists. I could rant about Robert Hunter's racism and sexism and the hysterical pseudo-science he resorts to in this book, but I'll just say this: according to Thermageddon, Hunter has at least 3 children and those children are reproducing as fast as they can. If Hunter believes that he and his offspring have the right to bring as many children into this overcrowded world as they please, how dare he tell the suffering masses of China they can't enjoy air conditioning or automobiles?Apocalyptic weather forecasts like those in Thermageddon may sell a lot of books, but they miss the point. Human beings can survive drastic climate change. What we can't survive is the destruction of the oceans, the loss of biodiversity and fresh water resources and 10 billion people on this planet..."
1,1 of the sets was warped badly,I ordered 3 sets of these and 1 of the sets was warped badly. Nesco said to send them back to Amazon for a refund. Packing and shipping is more than the $12 I paid for them. At least the other 2 sets were good. Great quality control and attitude Nesco!
4,80's Overload,"Good Lord, this is 80's to the max, but on a global scale. This collection has not only many of the american top hits, but also includes the international hits as well. My fave's include tose funky cheeky hits like "" Can't Take My Eyes Off You"", ""One Night in Bangkok"" and ""Boogie Oogie Oogie"". There's even a few live tracks to spruce things up, like Alan Parson's ""Eye In The Sky"" and David Bowie's ""China Girl"". Personally, I'm not that familiar with many of the europen hits, but if you are in need of an international 80's fix, you can't get a better collection than this."
2,"Robert Ludlum's ""The Paris Option""","I found this book to be the least interesting of the three ""Covert One"" novels with Robert Ludlum's name on them. I found it to be quite difficult to keep from throwing it in the round file before I finished it. I did give it a two star rating because it did keep my interest albeit boring. I think Robert Ludlum's name should not be on any book not authored by him. Now that this great mystery writer is dead, publishers should not be allowed to use his name to sell books. If his name had not been on the cover of the book, I would not have purchased it. I assume that he had made outlines of the three Covert One novels before he died and the co-authors went from there. This particular one should have been in the Science Fiction section of the bookstore instead of the Mystery Section."
5,Molto Bene!!!,I could listen to this CD all day long and not get bored with it. I listen in my car and at work. Its so soothing to listen to and Bocelli's voice is amazing! This CD is a definite one to buy!
2,ZOMBIE SNOOZEFEST! ONLY INTERESTING FOR NOSTAGIA!,I caught this on MGM's HD channel. The film probably looked better on this station than it ever did! This was another one of those war time films just to take people's mind off of bigger more real horrors. I know it probably gave people the best nap they had in a long time. Silly and boring with the usual white eyed stereotype frightened black guy(comic relief thank you!)running around with some very non scary zombies. Poor John Carradine!.....he deserved better than this!
4,Great eye cream,Good price for a vitamin c eye cream. Cream is similar to one the doctor sold me and much cheaper .
3,"Good, but...","I felt that there was no REAL character development where the charcters just seemed dry and rigid. Half the time Lilith, the main character, annoyed me more than anything else. Other than that, it is pretty typical as far as scifi novels go. It didn't *wow* me at all, and after I finished reading it I didn't really take anything meaningful away from it.To each their own, you may or may not like it. But I do not feel that it is anywhere close to a ""great read""."
2,great design but not durable,I had the heater for about a year. It was in a tank with four 5-inch-long red ear sliders. It stayed on the bottom of the tank and never moved. Unfortunately it stopped working and Tetra has honored my request for a replacement.
5,The best there is,"This has to be one of the best leather care products out there. I have used it on my leather coat, car seats and shoes. Does a fantastic job of softening and conditioning the leather. Even protects my leather shoes from salt damage here in the midwest, where sidewalk and street salt can really ruin a pair of leather shoes in no time. Would recommend to anyone."
5,Kids Enjoy this CD!,I use this CD with my special needs students. They enjoy the soothing sounds of the steel pans. Great music activities to use with or with out instruments. Knote
3,Faith Evans,"On her new album ""Keep The Faith"", Faith Evans suped it up a notch with 2 hit dance-hall gems: ""All Night Long"" and ""Love Like This."" Her new album also features slower love songs, which she's originally known for from her first bangin' album, the self entitled ""Faith."" The first album is also just as good with the hit songs ""Ain't Nobody"" ""You Used To Love Me"" and a duet with soulstress Mary J. Blige called ""Love Don't Live Here Anymore."" I recommend checking out both albums which feature production by commercial rap star Puff Daddy. Just look for my trademark name atop the review and you can trust that it's gonna be true and informative. ~Peace."
2,Not reliable back-up device and poor customer service.,Completely failed after 4 months of light usage as a primary back-up device. Luckly I have all the original data at my main computer. So I called the customer service for the replacement. To my suprise they refuse my request and asked me to download some free HD-recovery software from the internet and tried to fix it by myself. And they said the warranty covers REPAIR ONLY with one way shiping. He promised to email me the RMA # and then no response so far. Looks fancy but this is not reliable hard drive and I will never buy any product from the LaCie again.
2,This Book Sucks,". . . and I don't say this because I can't do algebra. This book, unlike the algebra books I used when I was at Haverford, seems like it was written by a committee -- a committee of government-sanctioned idiots.Stay away from these highly-processed, politically-correct texts. It's no wonder the nation's kids are getting dumbed down with text books like these."
2,I hated these,I am a med student and we listen to our lectures online after class is over... these things were good for the first 2 months and then they started falling apart. The part near the ear starts pealing off and exposing the wires. Many of my friends had to get replacements as well since many had these. Becareful.
4,Better than most Oprah Book Club Choices,"I don't normally go for Oprah Book Club novels, but this one was really worth the read. It is extremely dark at times, but ultimately very engaging and moving."
3,A decent historical overview,"Thomas's book is a good overview of the evolution of the Washington press corps and its relationships with various presidents since the 50s. Anyone who wants to gain insight on the current press corps' lapdog relationship with the Bush administration would do well to read this book.And, contrary to what John R. Linnel would have you believe, the book is not a hysterical diatribe against the Bush administration. While Thomas is critical of Bush in places, she is an equal opportunity curmudgeon, lashing out mainly at what she sees as the dangerous abdication of the press of its central role as watchdog in a democratic society.The book drags in places, but it's nice to have the voice of long experience to help give shape to one's view of an important democratic institution."
2,Soveit Tragedy,Very disappointing. Malia indulges his sociological viewpoint with very little or no references to history. His opinions become dull and without much insight. It is a old time cold war smear. Wasted my money.
4,It does the job.,"I am technically oriented and I wasn't very happy when Novell made a bean counter course a prerequisite for their Certified Internet Professional program. To make things worse their are no practice tests for this course. So it was with a certain lack of enthusiasm that I ordered Novell's Certified Internet Business Strategist Study Guide and began preparing for the test.When I read the book, it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be and I actually learned a lot of interesting things about putting a business on the Internet. I made my own practice test by copying all the questions and answers at the end of the chapters to 3 X 5 index cards. After spending a week plowing through a stack of 200 index cards I passed the test with a score of 750 out of 800.While I wasn't enthusiastic about the material, the book contained everything I needed to pass the test. For that I give it four stars."
4,Great Investment!,"I purchased this breadmaker because of the express bake and extra features my current breadmaker doesn't have. My old bread maker I have been working solidly for 9 years however I work out of the home now and current breadmaker doesn't have delay bake timer or express bake so I can only use it on weekends. This Breadmaker is build solid with easy instructions, I just made an express bake loaf and it turned out great. I am very pleased with my purchase."
3,NO VIDEO!!!,"The machine would be great if not for the fact that they send you the video that is supposed to be included, and wasn't, and now I have to go through the red tape to get the video as to how it works! I wish that the products would come with what they tell you they come with!!!"
1,Rubbish,"I attempted to read this book several years ago and found it to be utter rubbish!! This book is worthy of the ""National Enquirer"" as opposed to a serious biography of Heinrich Himmler. Himmler is a subject worthy of a biography for his infamous career but Padfield's work is so full of inaccuracies on so many levels I tossed the book in the trash after the first few chapters it was so bad.A better but not nearly as lengthy biography can be found in Heinz Hoehne's ""The Order of the Deaths Head."" This book however is nonsense."
1,APPALLING!,"Even though this book was written back in the 70's it amazes me that it's still in print! Morrison is grossly ignorant about a great many things. One, she claims to be a Satanic Witch! Satan is a Christian invention and Wiccans don't believe in this entity. Understanding this, one can clearly see that a concept such as ""Satanic Witch"" is highly inconceivable! Also, many of her spells are contridictory to the Wiccan Rede. She clearly doesn't understand what she tries to write about. Try Cunningham or Buckland. Thy're worth their weight in GOLD!"
4,Waterpik imports,"Waterpik arrived safe and sound. However it is not compatible with Australian volyage, so within minutes it was smokin'- ie strange acrid smell and billows of smoke from the unit. Turned it off and now can't use it at all.Aussie customers beware!!!!!"
5,Lolita,"A brilliant adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's novel penned by the author himself, Kubrick's ""Lolita"" satirizes the vulgar desires and warped intellect of Humbert, magnificently played by Mason. Upgrading Lolita's age to make the film palatable to audiences in 1962, Kubrick emphasized the farcical aspects of the source material, drawing an extraordinary performance from Sellers, who plays Humbert's lecherous (and oft-disguised) writer friend Clare Quilty. Winters is by turns perky and melancholic as the unwitting Charlotte. You'll fall hard for the daring ""Lolita."""
4,Its good,"This game is fun but it is not as polished as gta 3. I was a little dissapointed with this game after spending a few hours with it. It has some impressive new features, but for me it just didn't seem as fun as gta 3. I think the developers focused too much on making the video game version of scarface, i would have rather had a godfather knock off, maybe in the next game. Overall it's still an addictive game and is better than 95% of the games today."
2,A Nice Box,"If it weren't for the so cute/nostalic/decorative box that the pick-up sticks are housed in, this item would have been sent back.Like most people, I brought this item for nostalic purposes and to share what I use to play, ""back in the day"" with my nieces. Unfortunately, other than the concept, the pieces fall short of what I remember.The sticks are made of wood instead of plastic, which I knew before buying & was okay with it. I even thought it would be an improvement. However, the wood is cut thick, so the game is less challenging. Plus, the extra weight causes the sticks not to scatter well.However, for $8 the box is a too cute decorative piece on our play shelf, so we kept it. We'll try to find some ""real"" pick-up sticks to actually play with."
5,"Must Have if you write! It's the lost scrolls of ""Elements of Style""","Writers need the rules of Strunk and White's ""Elements of Style"" but they also need the inspiration tools nicely stacked in the pages of ""Myth, Magic and Metaphor."" A great gift for the budding and seasoned artist."
5,Awesome Book!,This book is soo good. I read the book in a day and could not put it down. The characeters are real and so are the consequences of their decisions. It's beautifully written. Also read Flame the book is very good as well. Both are a must read!
1,SHARP AQUOS,"DO YOUR SELF A FAVOR, put your wallet away. 3 months into my ownership the sound card gave up, that was on Dec. 10th. today is Jan. 11th. and nobody at SHARP or their local ( pardon the expression ) service vendor, can tell me when I will have the unit back. Dear God buy from some other manufacturer."
5,The Best,"I have found the Operation Flashpoint games to be the most realistic games I have played. They not only present the player with challenge, but also offer varying scenarios each time you log into a particular segment of the game. I have played the original and the two expansions many times and continue to be challenged by them. I own many similar type games but always seem to come back to these. I would highly recommend these games to anyone who likes the war action type games."
2,Dated material,"Doesn't rank up there with Calfo, Fenner, Borneman, Delbeek, Tullock, or Sprung. I learned nothing new."
1,Don't waste your money!!,"I bought this feeder for my mom for Mother's Day. My parents live in a very heavily bird populated area. They were excited and filled the feeder immediately. Well, it has been almost 5 months and the feeder is still full! They haven't seen one single bird go to the feeder. Save your money and buy something else!!"
4,Great product but...,"This is a great product, very light in weight to carry around. But i highly recommend the one with the changing table, more useful for few bucks more."
2,Great track selection but poor mixing and volume,"I'm a Dj and own most of these tracks on vinyl, there are few CD collections of old school electro tracks available, so why Oh why do almost all of them have to be botched :( Yes the track selection has a good line up but thats where it ends. They never seem to mention in the description if these CD's are mixed, this one is. Some of the mixing is a little off beat and the songs are not leveled the same, so when one song is mixed into another and the first song is turned off the song that is now playing sound lower and feels out of place. Also the songs sound bland and are not direct master transfers. If your a dj looking to build your collections with full lenght separate tracks, skip this cd (and the 2nd Vol as well). If you just want a strole down memory lane this CD might work for you."
3,I WAS DISAPPOINTED,"I BOUGHT THIS ALBUM BECAUSE OF SEVERAL TIMES I SAW THESE GUYS ON PBS SPECIALS. I WANTED THEM TO EXTEND THE SONGS THE WAY THEY DID ON PBS; ESPECIALLY THEIR SIGNATURE SONG ""LOOKING FOR AN ECHO"". THEY DIDN'T. IT WAS LIKE THEY MADE THE ALBUM IN A STUDIO. THEY SUNG A LOT OF OLDIES, & DID A GOOD JOB. THEY MAY LOOK LIKE AN OVER-THE-HILL BUNCH OF WANNABE GANGSTERS (AFTER ALL, THEY'RE FROM BROOKLYN), & LEAD SINGER KENNY VANCE MAY LOOK LIKE HERMAN MUNSTER, BUT THESE GUYS ARE THE GOODS. THEY CAN REALLY SING. AND VANCE, EVEN THOUGH HE DIDN'T DO IT ON THIS ALBUM, CAN REALLY HOLD A NOTE. THESE GUYS ARE THE PLANOTONES, AND THEY ARE GREAT."
4,Excellent Resource for Military Terms,"I originally bought this book as I was learning arabic and working with several Arab military officers. One advantage is that this book appears to be based on the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) resources which means that the terms have been reviewed by several Arab-speaking nations.The Arab military personnel, with whom I have shared this book, unanimously like it. As a result, they have requested several copies for their own use. (since the dictionary translates both ways)The only limitation of the dictionary is that is is far from complete and lacks some of the more basic tactical terms."
4,Good Album,It wasn't a surprise that Mr. Del would deliver another hot album. The production is good. The lyrics are cool. Mr. Del is a good gospel rapper
2,flower of life,"they should really have this book in public libraries, so nobody has to spend money to read it. in it, melchizekdek proposes a geometric/mathematical model for radical abstract consciousness theories and a new age history of the world. mostly, it's rumors he's overhead, i dunno, outside a freemason cocktail party or something. it's not very well-written, which is good, since if you read it closely you can see how information can be manipulated to fit any argument. does sacred geometry exist? yes. do space aliens? maybe. portholes to other dimensions? if there were, i imagine there would be a starbucks coffeehouse at each end. walt whitman traversed more universes than this guy can shake a stick at. if you read this book, and believe everything in it, you're probably paranoid. get out more, and read better books."
5,"""Smokey Cool""","This is one of those albums that when you que up is always the topic of discussion. ""Who is this?"" they all ask. This music is very ""other-world dub"". Some people find dub boring and repetitious...Horsie is neither. Full of deep rich bass and just plain ""cool"" bass lines. If I had to describe his music I would say ""spacey narcotic dub"" - I stress the narcotic. Ryan Moore is Twilight Circus and he is one strange character...you would never guess this music was performed by a caucasion Canadian. I'm not sure about the amazon cd's but I know that if you buy the cd's from his web page www.twilightcircus.com, it comes personalized with Ryan's crazy drawings. Where else do you buy a cd from an artist and make the money order out to him personally? Highlights are Romy, Horsie, Carousel, Rock Salt. This is easily the most accessable Twilight Circus release to date...but all of them have a place in my player. Buy with confidence."
1,Make sure its what you ordered!,"Nikon are excellent scopes, the problem is that Amazon is advertising and selling a scope that does not exist. Nikon did not make a buckmaster 3-9x50 with the BDC reticle that I can find. Twice now they have sent me one with the Nikoplex reticle. I am very unhappy with amazons CS at this point. Make sure you get the right scope! (two weeks later)Amazon has made things right and did an EXCELLENT job fixing the situation. At this point I have NO complaints and am very happy with things. Thanks Amazon for the good CS."
5,Sordid Lives,"The funniest film in 25 years and yet it is playing in limited areas. In Palm Springs, CA , it has played for one year. I have seen it four times; some people have seen it more than 10 times. This movie is funnier than the movie, My Fat Greek Wedding. This low budget film starring Beau Bridges, Delta Burke, Olivia Newton-John, and Bonnie Bedalia is a must see film for everyone."
4,Nice,"This controller is a nice addition to any halo fans collection, but unless you really want the figure there is a rush to get one. Aside from aesthetic changes its identical to the regular controllers. The image resists scratching reasonably well. Also, the black battery pack matches this controller but unfortunately isnt included."
4,Good for certification purposes only,"If you need a kind of recipe to pass the exam and you don't mind in not knowing how to explain why some things are the way they are, this book is fine; all the necessary information is inside.However, if you are interested in getting a more conceptual knowledge, forget about it. This book is very very exam oriented."
1,A Warning.......DONT BUY,"I bought this item about 2 months ago. I took it on one trip with me and it worked fine. Every aspect of it was great, I like the look and the anti-skip. Then, on the second trip I took it on, I put in a new CD, and it didn't play. I figured it was the batteries, so I put in brand new batteries, and it still didn't work. Then, I tried to switch CDs, but it made no difference. Now, all the thing does is spin the CD for about 3 seconds, then say there is no disc. I think there is a problem with the laser, but I barely used the unit. I think that now on, I will get a personal CD player from a company that I know has a great reputation like Sony or Panasonic."
3,i miss pearl jam,"I just got the new cd and I'm betting thier be a lot of reveiws with words like mature ,growing, evolving, which is what this cd is I like it its has an intensity that is subtle but grabs you . The biggest problem is that i'm a pearl jam fan and this isn't what I paid my money for I want those catchey songs that you can't get out of your had and make you think that music just never gets this good . if you already have the other pearl jam cd's buy this its worth it just for the single but if you don't have any buy vs,ten hell even vitalogy because thats what your really looking for."
1,"Terrible, Just Plain Terrible","This is a terrible dictionary. Its hard to read, the art work is very poor, and it wasn't manufactured properly. World English? No, its basically American English dumbed down. They did a very poor job. If you'd like to own or read one of the best dictionaries order The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Third Edition."
3,Instrumental captivates but leaves out songs with vocals,"I really enjoyed the movie ""The Italian Job"" and one of the things that made it so good was the music. I had high hopes when I purchased the original motion picture soundtrack, but was disappointed with the lack of all vocalized songs especially the version of ""Money"" that was used in the end credits. The included background instrumental music tracks are captivating and entertaining, but they only supply just a part of the soundtrack. Unfortunately, there were no sample tracks to listen to before I made my purchase. I must admit that I do like and enjoy this CD despite the omissions. It's just that it could have easily been better."
4,Worth the price,"With a seven year old dirting up the rear of tan color seats with his feet,we needed something to save them. These inexpensive seat covers worked out great. They were easy to install, with a snug fit, and keep the bottom of shoes and wet boots from touching the seat material. Definitely worth the money."
5,The Innocent Libertine,"The second book in the series Heirs of Acadia, this book has lots of history plus fiction and suspense. You'll want to have all five books in this series. It's a good read."
4,A good resource for grave hunters,"I loved Permanent Californians! Unfortunately, it is out of date (1989). It also doesnt have all the celebrities but it gets you around the Calfornia cemeteries and gives you an interesting history!! I would highly recommend this book to all gravehunters!!!"
4,Fit and function were great and lightweight.,Bought this stove cover for my 3-burner in my trailer and it fit perfectly. Also it still works fine if you flip up half to use a forward burner. Comes with hardware to allow you to permanently attach it to the counter top. The thickness of the metal that this cover is made out of is pretty thin which is good and bad because it keeps the weight down but it doesn't allow for excessive weight to be placed on top of the cover. Good product for the price.
2,So Far So Good...So What Megadeth,"Not too fond of this one. Shoddy production. I feel either you like this album or you don't. I like ""Hook in Mouth"", the others I can take or leave. After the first two albums this one really slowed down. The album just doesn't do it for me. This one and ""United Abominations"", I haven't taken a liking to."
1,"Defective, this is exactly what i was afraid of","Im sorry to write a bad review, but i was so disapointed, waiting for this game to come in the mail and when it finally does , the game does not work. i tried cleaning it very carefully with a swab and alcohal, i tried restarting the station. eventually i put in another game to see if it was my nintendo. Nope my game worked perfectly. im so upset i spent the money for this game and i was sold a broken item, now i have to take time out of my schedule to print labels, package and drive somewhere to drop this off. This is bad business. You should always test the games before sending them. just cuz it looks fine does not mean it is."
3,Pros and Cons,"I prefer this food distribution toy because its a soft, quiet rubber as opposed to other toys out there that are plastic and LOUD on the floor or when they bang in to the wall. The downside is the rubber rips pretty easily, and therefore its not really durable and would be AWFUL for a chew-y dog."
3,Night Splint,"It was kind of hard to get used to it, since I roll all night long. Also, I had to have some help to strap the strap by the toes. Perfect angle for the healing process, comfortable to wear and reasonable price."
4,Book of Silk,"I first heard this music in a videogame. It was so surreal, so haunting and dreamlike I had to have it. So I bought the album. The first 5 songs create an awesome dreamscape and allow the imagination to go wild. There is a song or two though that's little more than noise, but that can be easily overlooked. The last song is the only one that has vocals, and it makes you wonder why the rest don't. It's very beautiful and enjoyable. As someone who normally listens to rock, I can easily switch to this and be entertained."
5,A must read,"For me this book was a horrifying read filled with images of destruction of life and the human soul. Wiesel's record of his experience in Auschwitz and Buchenwald caused me to question the depth of humanity's depravity towards one another. Also, you have to admire Wiesel's honesty in admitting his thoughts and the conflict he faced when dealing with his father. Most of us probably couldn't imagine doing such a thing towards our parents but when human existence has been whittled down to just surviving another day, I wonder how far we would go in Weisel's shoes.I read this book because it was referred to in an earlier book I read i.e. The Freedom Writer's Diary and I am not sorry that I read it. I recommend everyone to read it so that it might increase our awareness of what went on during the Holocaust and help us prevent similar events from happening."
4,"Good quality, needs a guide picture on the front","My daughters love this puzzle. We've had it over a year, and it's still in good shape. Nothing peeling or splitting, just some chew marks from my younger daughter. What's more, they still pull it out to play with after all this time. My only problem is that there is no picture of the puzzle on the front of the assembling board, only a small picture of it on the back. I'm used to doing puzzles where I have a picture to guide me. But my daughters have learned to put it together by matching similar colors or shapes, which is a good educational value too. For the price, I highly recommend it, even without the picture."
3,Too Slow,"The yoga in this DVD was way too slow! Maybe good for someone who has NEVER done any yoga or stretching before, but i found this soo slow and the dvd sooo long, that i would do a couple of moves and then fast forward."
1,awful crash prone program,"I have been working on computers since 1975. I have seen some awful programs, including some that I have written. This is the single most crash prone piece of software I have ever had the misfortune to use. No mater what you do, it WILL crash. It WILL corrupt HOURS of work and leave you with no option but to delete the file and start over again.USE ANYTHING BUT THIS SOFTWARE"
3,Great for the price,"As much as I would like to rate these higher, I just can't bring myself to give them above 3 stars. They are good speakers for the price, but I wish they were great speakers for the price. Logitech always produces great products, but this one is just good. My main gripes are that they sound a bit tinny and there is almost no bass to speak of with these. I think they could have done better, but I'm still satisfied with mine."
5,A Grand Slam With A Cherry On Top A Masterpiece,"Tom Oliphant's reconstruction of the 1955 season and the one and onlychampionship of the Brooklyn Dodgers is a masterpiece. Tom had an amazingyouth, full of New York characters like Sylvester Pat Weaver, Sigourney Weaverwhen she was still Susan, Yul Brynner and his sister, as well as hisbeing in the chorus of the Met. Billie Holiday makes a cameo too.A fond remembrance when New York had three great ball teams. Yes,WAlter O'Malley and Horace Stoneham deserve the obliquy they so richlyearned.I remember when the temples and churches prayed for Gil Hodges when hewas in a prolonged slump.Read this book and if you aren't a baseball fan already, you will becomeone."
1,Spent $1800 bucks - only lasted 1.5 years,"We bought this HDTV only to have it break after just a year and a half! It had some minor problems with the video output during that year and a half, but yesterday we were watching it and it suddenly started smoking and the screen went black. It only has a one year warranty. We tried calling Phillips tech support. They couldn't tell us what happened, how to fix it, what the 4 blinking red lights meant or any sort of helpful information!After looking around online we have found MANY people that have had the same problem with this TV. This will be the LAST Phillips product we ever buy!Do NOT waste your money on this TV!"
1,Meet the Spartans,"The heroic Leonidas, armed with nothing by leather underwear and a cape, leads a ragtag group of 13--count `em, 13!--Spartans to defend their homeland against the invading Persians (whose ranks include Ghost Rider, Rocky Balboa, the Transformers, and a hunchbacked Paris Hilton--no one is safe when the Spartans take on the biggest icons in pop culture). This is the worst movie I've ever seen."
3,A nice try to spice up some phish,"""Bring your self on a new pyscadelic journey into the wonderful world of phish"" is something of what the liner notes said. I don't think so. This album was interesting, and i enjoyed listening to it, but its not a great album. The bluegrass isn't increadible and there are absolutely no solos that will rock your mind, which is what makes phish so increadible. Plus the song selection is terrible, taking songs from only ""Story of the Ghost"", ""Rift"", and ""Picture of Nectar"". I would be careful with this album for it is definantly not what i thought it would be. If you love bluegrass, check out Bela Fleck. If its phish you want to hear, well stick to Phish."
5,"Sensitive, Intelligent and Truthful","A former member of a small New Age Cult in New Jersey, I spent all of 1997 trying to figure out what really happened to me after almost twenty years of involvement. Mr. Hassan's book was a turning point. It helped me define my prior circumstances and gave me permission to declare unequivocally that I had indeed been seduced into a genuine cult. The book is reader friendly and yet psychologically and intellectually precise. Most of all, Mr. Hassan's sense of humanity shines between the lines. Thank You for helping us, your readers, understand and begin to heal."
4,GREAT mid morning snack,"I like them as a midmorning snack with a cup of coffee. They are also great for those mornings you really aren't in the mood for breakfast, but know you'll be hungry later. They seem to keep you satisfied for an hour or two. They do taste great - not too sweet and not overly cake-like. Buy a bunch and keep them in the freezer until you need more."
1,Nothing to offer,"This book has nothing to offer except to waste the time of people obsessed by the Elizabeth Short case. Terrible with facts, all over the place with writing, this book is just out there to make money off of the obsession with this unsolved brutal murder. Don't buy into it. I did for a minute, wasted time reading it, and felt like a fool after realizing what it really is."
4,be sting!,"Sting continues to create great melodies with little ditties about life's little delimmas: such as games ex-lovers play in ""big lie, small world""...to attempting to erase a love with time in ""a thousand days"". Country western doesn't escape Sting's musical genius either. He always pushes his boundries with experimentation ..do not expect him to put out carbon copy music...expect to be stung by his masterful versatility fusing jazz, (you can hear some Miles Davis techniques in his backup rhythums) rhythum and blues into his music..he is getting better with age!"
1,Send this horse to pasture. Please.,"Out of the 766 pages of this book, less than 100 are worth reading. If you like over 600 pages of identical women trying to manipulate each other, while yanking on their braids, twirling their skirts, and turning a well-turned calf, this book is for you. If you like anything resembling the earlier books in this series (that's to say, anything resembling an interesting story), I suggest you skip to the very end of the book -- I certainly did.Normally, I hate abridged books -- I feel like they are an insult to the author's vision. However, if there is any book in the history of mankind that needs it, it's this one.To compare Jordan to Tolkien is like comparing a Harlequin Romance book to Homer's Odessey. Do yourself a favor and read a real Fantasy writer."
5,Got this to give as a gift,"Loved the samples I heard at amazon. I'm excited for my friend to listen to it. It seems intact, so I don't believe my friend will have any issues with it."
4,My 21 month old daughter loves this seat!,Our daughter was throwing the occasional fit when she couldn't sit at the table like a big person. We bought it based on all of the terrific reviews and we weren't disappointed. Highly recommend it to other parents!
5,Love it!!,Awesome CD for kids!! Works like a charm to get kids to sleep!! Great quality and we love it so much!!
4,Rapture in Death,The Dallas series is probably the best ever written by Nora Roberts. I got more enjoyment from these books than I have from any of her others. I can usually take or leave her books. I started this series and had to read them all. When I finished my sister read them all. We can not wait for the new one due out this spring.
5,Great product,These staples fit our staple gun and have a sharp point on the ends so they staple through almost anything.
1,Don't bother,Doesn't really do much of anythying. Yes it gets hot but when coupled with thehigh volume of air coming out of the blower the air is cold two feet away fromthe unit. Can't turn the blower down low enough to make this little heaterworthwile.
1,This guy is a spammer.,"Just got spam from this guy.Robert G. AllenNew York Times #1 Best Seller:""Time and time again, I'm referred to as 'America's #1 Millionaire Maker'... that means one thing:I take ordinary people (some of them right out of the unemployment line and some right out of Regis Philbin's studio audience) and show them exactly what to do to create six-figure incomes - andTHEN THEY DO IT!""I can show you how to do the same... Check it out.kiiyxh tv gvycdwxvgo xu fjbfqwz m y"
4,works great!,no problems so far. keep it to 5 or less pages that you load in at once and it works perfectly
3,A Great Idea,"The overall concept is a great one. It fits well in the hand and is well balanced. The only complaint I have is that the sliding mechanism isn't smooth, and I have problems keeping the blades in place."
5,Rodale,The Rodale work has been my Organic Gardening Bibles for years. I love their world view and wish more would learn how to use what they know to develop nutritious home eating.
2,Nothing Special,"Angelic Layer - Vol. 2 - On a Wing and a Player contains episodes five through eight in the CLAMP series about a young, innocent girl who falls in love with the game of Angelic Layer. Suzuhara is continuing her ""miracle rookie"" run of wins in the Angelic Layer tournament. She is assisted by Mr. Icchan, who is the ""father"" of Angelic Layer, unbeknownst to Suzuhara.This is pretty mediocre stuff from the great studio. Suzuhara is so naiive, she has no personality. The surrounding characters are equally annoying, especially Suzuhara's loud and obnoxious friend Tamayo. The only reason I keep watching is for the battle dolls, or ""Angels,"" which are cool.The best part of volume two is a voice actor interview with Kevin Corn (Satoko) and Monica Riahl (Tamayo). It is great to hear them rank on Angelic Layer and call the characters ""retard"" and ""loser."""
5,Christmas With the Trapp Family Singers,The item was exactly as discribed and arrived in good condition. I would gladly buy from this seller again...anytime!
1,Pretty Disappointed.,"I guess I expected a little more tips and tricks for someone who isn't a complete novice on the forefront of savings. This large, almost cardboard-style book reads like a children's book, with a simple tip per giant page.. and the tips all seem pretty obvious. These might be good tips for people who couldn't realize on their own to reduce frivolous spending like Starbucks lattes and tucking aside money for the unseen, but for the rest of us who were hoping for a more novel/article-like book with good wisdom like we've come to expect from these authors, I think the first step to saving to afford a family would be to skip buying this book."
4,Great vacuum,"I was tired of lugging our shop vac and house vac outside to detail our cars. I bought this handheld because someone said it worked as good as the hand held Dyson. I don't have a Dyson so I cannot compare, but I can tell you this works really well. I have two dogs, both of whom shed and this does wonders on dog hair. Also good for around the bed and the baseboards where it's tough to get the vacuum. Works well in the car as well. Someone complained about the cord not staying wrapped, but mine stays put. The hose works pretty well too. Perfect for the car. If it has one flaw it's that it doesn't have a way to hang it. This is something I'd hang in the garage, but not an option."
3,"Reader's Digest used to be a premier rag. Lately it's ""Just Okay"" but I hold out hope they'll improve again!","Everyone has experienced Reader's Digest. It's a refreshing rag to learn about new stories and the Laughter section is always welcome. I've seen more Reader's Digests in peoples bathrooms all over the country (and in my own). Why is it we all keep this mag handy when otherwise predisposed? Probably because we can always find an article just the right length while we're going ! ha!The magazine has become skinnier with yet more pharmaceutical ads. When they do away with all the drug marketing and restore the number of articles and sections to the quantity of yesteryear, it'll be a superb mag again."
2,It did not seduce me,"I always thought it would be a good idea to make a comedy about young Casanova - his incredible adventures, love stories, his struggle with church. Casanova was a fascinating historic figure, a soldier, spy, diplomat, writer, adventurer who will also be remembered as the greatest seducer and lover the world had ever seen (if only from his own words). His life and mystery surrounded him has made him an ultimate hero for many novels, plays, and movies. Sadly, not all Casanova's movies are good and Lasse Hallström's comedy belongs to the long list of not successful movies. Sure, it is gorgeous to look at - it is 18th Century Venice after all, and locations, photography, Vivaldi's music, costumes, wigs, make up are first class but beyond all this is just another typical chick flick or romcom with Heath Ledger whose Casanova is not that brilliant and fascinating figure but just a cute guy - no more, no less.2.5/5"
1,DIRECTED BY AN IMBECILE. WHAT A WASTE...,"Want to see close-ups of audience members, stagehands, and background musicians working keyboards, drums and synthesizers - while Bjork sings OFFscreen? Then you've come to the right place. Could have been a glorious concert film, but unfortunately the moronic film editor seems to be interested in everything EXCEPT Bjork! Time and time again, while Bjork is hitting the high notes of an impassioned stage performance - the camera cuts AWAY from her and the lens is directed elsewhere.Just what you always wanted: ENDLESS footage of fingers working the dials on an amplifier or a drum machine or some goddamned thing, while Bjork sings her heart out - OUT of camera range, that is. This DVD will leave you exasperated and furious. I was ready to strangle the cameraman after viewing the $%&*@ thing. If I'd just wanted to hear her voice I'd have played the CD. You should too. Save your money."
2,S&H cost more than the product itself,Bought this product as a combo with the Hoover SteamVac then found out that the S&H for the detergent alone is $16.90 while the SteamVac ships FREE. I could have bought this at local Wal-Mart for $15.45 plus tax.
3,Great film but the narrator mars the experience,"The book Celluloid Closet is a favorite of mine, and the film would be one as well except that even now, years after it was made, the knowledge that Tomlin was closeted herself when she did the narration makes it hard to watch.The ironies and hypocrisies in using Tomlin are a little distracting. They add a second layer of meaning to the narration that is a little sour."
1,Poor,I'm done attempting to connect this unit. Connection has failed repeatedly. Would not recommend this unit.
4,"very light, convenient travel adapter","I also bought this for my Dell M1210, just before a trip from the US to Japan. It powers and charges my laptop just fine, plus it is lighter and thinner than the Dell power brick. It doesn't get noticeably hot, either - even after many straight hours of operation on the plane. The smarttips are a bit expensive, but they work just fine and are worth the investment.Aside from the price, the one negative point is the short plug connecting the adapter to the wall outlet, which leaves the adapter dangling in most cases. other than that, however, this is a great travel adapter."
1,Breaks Down -- Warranty No Good!,I agree with all the other comments about this product not lasting very long. Ours worked fine for about a year then suddenly stopped playing for no reason. I called customer service and was basically told I was out of luck!
2,Smells great but.....,I love love love the smell of soy milk and was very disappointed with his body butter. It is really not moisturizing and does not go on smooth at all. Very disappointed. This may be why they have one called body soufflé now.
1,Oh Please...,"This book is a joke. I could really honestly care less about what Kerry (or Bush) did 30 years ago. The claims in this book are based on lies and unfounded rumors. www.mediamatters.org has debunked all the claims in this book so far. Anyone interested in the truth would like to check out that site.Bush's record isnt exactly clear either, take a look at www.realchange.org, a non-partisain website that digs up the dirt on all presidential candidates."
2,Really wanted it to work,I will have to add this deodorant to my long list of 'non-working natural deodorant'. I have to reapply it several times along the day and still does nothing for me. Still looking for a natural solution...
4,Main actors are developing,"Some actors are stiff in first season but director is giving freedom for actors to develope their part, special effects are very good and we know that shooting is very difficult on the road but crew is doing a great job. Shooting in rainy weather or with snow is a very natural touch and shows crew & cast dedication. Nice editing to give that end of the world climate. Unexpected cliffhanger but the problem now is the 3 season is not released yet of this date Nov 2012"
5,BREATHTAKING!...,"This book was so believable it was hard to believe it was fiction. It just change my life, I couldn't put it down. I have to say the author was superb in setting the stage and bringing a different world to us. This book should be on every shelf in America. it talks so much about life, forgivness, Love, and honesty. if the world wants to get real about themselves this is a book to read. it's just Breath Taking!..."
5,I couldn't put the book down! What an amazing gift she has!,I had a difficult time locating it but checked it out at the local library! What courage she has to use this gift and what a supportive family too. I look forward the her next book...I couldn't put it down and finished reading it within 3 hours!!! I certainly look forward to meeting her for a private reading!
1,Didn't work,This DVD did not even work. I would like my money back because I was unable to use this in my Special Education classroom. I am very disappointed.
2,bad,"This was a bad film. It's clear why the film didn't receive more notice from the Academy Awards. All it has going for it is a talented cast, and the ridiculous script irritates much more than entertains. The characters motivations are always questionable, although Michael Douglas is consistently likable. All in all, I think you'll find this movie is not as good as you thought it would be."
4,sigmaspeedometer,"for the price it's a great speedometer. keeps track of all your stats very well. my only complaint is that it gets confused wether you are going forwards or backwards easily (the little arrow points in the direction it thinks you are going), but that defect does not effect your total distance or trip distance.the other complaint is that the speed is only read with 2 readings for the decimal point. .0 or .5.but for the price this is a great reliable speedometer.im on my second one of these simply because my first one was stolen because i forgot to unclip it from my bike. (it has a nice twis and pull system to remove the computer when you park your bicycle somewhere)."
2,game with little math,"My son, 4, likes to play this because you can get shrek to jump around in a dungeon. OK, he is chasing quarters and dimes, the numbers add up, etc., but the math is not central to what he is doing and can be ignored. (It is ignored.) Must it be that way for one so young? I think it is too easy to say, well, I guess there is no alternative to just playing. THere must be a more imaginative way to stimulate a young mind in math. I believe this fails - there is no sense of ongoing game, no true link to math concepts.Not recommended."
3,MISREPRESENTED,"I purchased this CD because I am an avid collector of original Jamaican ska. I simply love this musical genre. This particular collection is not all ska. Several of the tracks are calypsos. There is some good vintage ska here, but the people who put this together shouldn't have marketed it as a ska compilation because it is not. It should be re-titled to better reflect what it is. Ska is ska. Calypsos are calypsos. Calypsos and ska tunes DO NOT sound good together. I was disappointed in this CD. I'm the Big Oh and I say don't say it's ska when it's part calypso. I gotta go."
4,super stickies,Used these for a brainstorming session; the large format works great and you can actually see what is written.
5,History and Mystery,"For a pathologist, he is an excellent writer. It is story and history combined and melds well with the subsequent century that Michael Jecks writes about regarding ""Crowners and bailiffs."" I regard both as good writers, which is an understatement."
5,Great Series - Blu-ray Quality is Amazing!,This series is only made better by the high audio and video quality of blu-ray. If you enjoyed the series on TV then this is a must buy. Highly recommended!
4,"Delicious, but Small","The product is kind of deceiving, the bars are not as big as you think, but still very delicious! Yay"
1,BEWARE,I don't know what this AC adapter is supposed to be for but it's not for a Gamebow. I have a classic gameboy and this does not fit in any jack on my Gameboy.
1,Should be called SUPER CRAPPY,"I checked this book out of my local library and was appalled at how tacky the bulk of the projects are. This seems to be an imitation of the popular Stitch N Bitch series (though the focus here is all sorts of crafts, not just knitting), and a poor one at that. Whereas the SNB books feature designs that are innovative, beautiful, and sophisticated, Super Crafty is filled with projects that lack any real purpose and look just cheap and silly.This book seems to be aimed at adults, however I don't think anyone over twelve would be caught dead having most of these items lying around the house."
5,"The BEST book if you seek illumination, not documentation!","This book was written by two gentlemen with whom I had the good fortune to work at MacUser Magazine (before it was acquired by MacWorld). John Rizzo was Technical Editor at MacUser, and he's easily the most accurate and informed author available for this kind of book. Dan Clark is one of America's most gifted technical illustrators; his ""see through"" drawings of computers & components always AMAZE other artists and even the most hardcore techies. True to the Mac tradition, this book feels like a looking-glass that lets you float knowlingly through complex electronics, instead of boring you with Windoze-style ""hardware documentation."" A great gift for budding young geeks and undecided potential Mac owners."
3,The lowdown,"This overall, is a very cute cd. It seems Jessica's strong point is her ballads. Most of her ballads (which make up most of the album!) are very beautiful and emotionful, especially ""My Wonderful"", ""Where You Are"", and ""Your Faith In Me"". On the other hand, her fast songs can be a bit ""cutesy"". They can become a bit typical and annoying, in my opinion, especially ""I've Got My Eyes on You"". The two ones that are any good are excellent, ""Final Heartbreak"" and ""Woman In Me"". I think that if you really liked ""I'm Gonna Love You Forever"" and ""Where You Are"", you will love this album!"
3,The Comback Begins Here,"Cheap Trick recruited metal producer Jack Douglas to toughen up the sound after the lackluster ""Next Position Please."" The overall presence of ""Standing On The Edge"" is much meatier than its two predecessors but the great songs are lacking here. All of that can be forgiven, however, by the fantastic near miss single ""Tonight It's You."" Had their record label cared (note that Rick Nielsen's name is misspelled on the album sleeve, that should give you a clue as to how much Epic was - at the time - still interested in Cheap Trick), ""Tonight It's You"" might have been the hit that waited until ""The Flame."""
2,Fidji Pepper Mill,"Even though we like the style, we are somewhat disappointed in this product. Its grinding mechanism seems to be different from another Peugeot mill (Paris model, I believe) that we have and have been very impressed with. The grind from it seems to be much smoother and easier to control. I was under the impression that all their mechanisms are a similar design, but now am not sure."
3,This book had an editor? Where?,"I completely agree with Efrem about the editing, or lack thereof. Aside from the errors Efrem mentioned, I also noticed that there seems to be a lack ot European cultural knowledge, e.g., the Irish are associated with shamrocks (not four-leaf clover) and the carved wooden horses (if the author means Dala horses) are Swedish (not Danish). In addition, although I do like the Benni Harper books for the stories and the interplay of the various regular characters, cannot at least one of them speak in standard grammatical English? Several of them have university educations--some people come out of school knowing when to use who and whom, lie and lay, I and me, etc., but evidently no one in San Celina. In at least one place (I wish I could find it now) the wrong word was used--it had a similar sound but an *entirely* different meaning. These things make reading a chore, not fun."
5,Very satisfied,"This toy was mailed to my grand-daughter and grand-son. They love, love, love the toy. They play with it all the time. I am also satisfied with the price and mail service, everything went as promised. Thank you."
2,"Good Size, Poor Design","I was not impressed with this tub. As many reviewers note, the shower operation button is in a very inconvenient spot (to operate it while holding it with wet hands, you necessarily interrupt the water flow with your fingers). The tub is also leaky, and with the shower installed, my 5-week-old daughter is already hurting for legroom. Next time I'd go for a simpler, more utilitarian model."
1,Worst customer service. Cheap quality!,"WORST customer service ever. ""your lucky you got 5 years out of it"" That is exactly what I was told by CS rep about the 450 dollar, broken heater I have. They offered me no help, no service, just said.. too bad. Only to find out, not only did I over pay... but the product is junk! Not made in the US as advertised. Not supported by the company for service. Contacted the retailer and was told ""Oh yes... Marley is horrible for customer service, we have had problems with them as well"" Enter at your own risk folks!"
1,PNY Geforce FX5200 256MB PCI Graphics Card,"This Graphics card didnot work as expected, after numerous attempts to resolve installation and operation problems, the card was returned for refund,(which I have not received as of this date.) I WOULD NOT reccomend this graphics card to anyone with built in graphics card in their computer. There seems to be too many software conflicts."
4,Loved Victoria Smurfit's Nina Character,"By the end of ""Bulletproof Monk"", the ancient Tibetan secrets that are supposed to be its focus are less interesting than an acting-for-the-camera mystery.How can an unknown Irish television actress (Victoria Smurfit), who looks like a pre-implant Patsy Kensit and whose supporting part is relatively small, flat-out steal the movie from the the actors with the four bigger parts?A related question would be how Smurfit, wearing loose fitting pantsuits, can come across about seven times sexier than former spokesmodel Jaime King? Actually King's character is pretty sexy, but when Smurfit appears midway into the film you forget all about King.Impressive performance Victoria, you elevate an ordinary formula movie-your scenes alone make it worth watching.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child."
5,Young Thomas Edison,"This is one of my favorite classic films and this release is very good. So glad it has finally been released to DVD. I also orderded 'Thomas Edison the Man' and it was equally as good. If you like calssic films and the history of a great inventor, then you will also enjoy these films. As always, I am very satisfied with Amazon."
3,A little much,"The movie featured Leighanne Wallace (she played Tanna) and I think that she did a great job. However, her part was small. There should've been a little less focus on the animals, and a little more on the relationships between the three boys and their parents, etc. However, it was fun to watch, espically if you're a fan of one of the actors."
5,Easy to deal with!,"I ordered these glasses the week before Christmas and got them within days. They came in mint condition, good as new!"
5,Set of 10 batteries for pennies each,"I used these for an LCD clock and so far, 1 battery has lasted longer than a year. So for the price, these are great a deal."
2,"Mr. Allen, your shtick is old, old, OLD!","Another Woody Allen film, another parade of pointless cameos of Hollywood stars clamoring to be in a Woody Allen film. I've enjoyed Allen's previous films, but after viewing Deconstructing Harry, I 'm afraid Woody Allen just grates on me now. His neurotic shtick is the same in all of his comedy films, regurgitated ad infinitum. Mr. Allen, you make good films, but PLEASE, stay behind the camera!"
4,fun and interesting,"Have always learned languages grammar first. This eschews that method, and I am enjoying memorization, and learning the phonemic components of Greek. Minuses - no text book: I would like to be able to read Greek, as well, and must search for other sources. It's a good first start!"
3,Beware the Epilogue,"In truth this is an amazing piece of historical fiction. Being a 2 book a day reader, I've become jaded and it takes alot to get me to run home to read a book. This story had it, funny characters, great dialogue and a to die for hero. The book is by turns witty and charming and had the Eplogue NOT been included I would have added Julia London to my must buy list. But not now.. I literally threw the book across the room and as far as I am concerned I wasted 3 hours reading a book that in the long run left me feeling rather [upset]. So in fair warning don't read the Epilogue unless you DON'T like to think of ""Happily Ever After."""
2,Not Grisham's best,"This was an okay story - I was just expecting GREAT things after reading numerous reviews. Took this on vacation to read at the beach and it ended up more wet and sandy than read! I have read every Grisham book and have really liked most of the others, but this one was just not as good. I always feel that these books move along really well, have great characters and great stories and then just seem to fizzle to an ending. Is this just me? Worth reading, but truly not the best work by this author."
4,"Well made, large and heavy.","Surprise, surprise! ""Made in the USA""! Full compliment of attachment accessories, quite sturdy, appears that it'll last forever. This is the first electronic / electrical product I've bought in YEARS that didn't come from China. Five stars if a little less heavy and large."
3,"Okay, but not worth the price","I bought this for my husband because he really liked the idea of a self-cleaning razor. It worked okay for a month or so and then broke. He sent it in for repair and it came back working properly. A few months later, it broke again. Again it was fixed. Props to customer service for this.Since we were already going broke paying for the cleaning solutions, when it broke a third time, we decided it wasn't worth the hassle and bought a different one."
2,The start of something new...,"I have to admit that it took me a long time to become a Pride FC fan. When I heard of another MMA event outside of the UFC I was very excited... until I actually watched. These early Pride events are in almost every way boring to an extreme seldom seen outside of soccer. There are a couple (literally a couple) of good fights on this collection, but overall this really isn't worth the time or money unless you are a hardcore collector looking for a piece of MMA history. Pride really has come a very long way. If you are used to seeing current Pride events and have not been exposed to these first events, you will more than likely have little to no interest in this collection. Save your time and money for the later Pride events."
4,Impossible to put down,"This is an amazingly well written book. It had me staying up way too late into the evening, and I was really concerned about the characters. A fantastic conclusion to Pandora's Star.My only gripe is that at the end it doesn't mention some of the characters that were part of the whole story. There are a lot of characters though and that must have been hard to do, but it would have been nice knowing what happened to all the key ones."
3,Copper Clad Cookware,Have been only using the non stick pan. The food gets stuck and is difficult to clean.
1,disappointed,"My iron is only about 2 years old. It has always leaked a little. That became progressively worse-until the last few weeks. The water started flowing out of the handle area if I filled it even close to the top. Mine also started shutting off on its own after a few months of use. Finally, it completely stopped working a couple of days ago. The iron looks brand new-like I never even used it! I'll never buy another Rowenta."
5,"New Gaffigan DVD ""King Baby""!! March 29th!!","I watch a lot of comedy DVDs, it is perhaps my favorite form of performance and entertainment. Jim Gaffigan is one of the most originally funny comics out there today. Its unbelievable the wit and humor Jim brings to sometimes simple aspects of daily life (or daily meals!). Even more amazing is that he doesn't stoop to the level of a lot of comics who just yell obscenities while yelling about sex.Jim returns this March 29th with his new special ""King Baby."" I recently saw in LA his new set that constitutes the special and it is GREAT! A must for any bacon lover![...]"
2,Not for me,The scent reminds me of clove and nutmeg. It's pleasant but it lingers a lot longer than I would like. I think I noticed it a good 10 hours after I put it on. It does make my face feel great after a shave but I also think the bay oil is causing me to break out. I'll probably stop using it. I should also mention that it took 9 days to get a shipping confirmation which said it was already delivered. It was then delivered 4 days after that.
3,Misses the Point,"This is a cute story, but certainly misses being the great story that the original Peter Pan is. It misses the important point, which is that Peter refuses to grow up. It blames his condition on a magic spell."
1,What a flop,"This was such a disappointment. It read like a Lifetime movie of the week, only not even as good. The premise of a group of middle-aged women spontaneously leaving home and walking had promise, but the characters were never developed well. It fell into a ""poor me"" sympathy-fest, where all men are inconsiderate dolts, and only women can ""understand"" anything important or meaningful. I also felt like the author was trying to push lesbianism as the solution to all their problems.Don't waste your money or your time, I'm afraid."
5,Don't pass this one by......,"I started using audio books as a way to pass the time on my long commute to and from work; this being the fourth book that I purchased. I never expected to be so totally engrossed and entertained. I often found myself sitting in my vehicle after arriving at my destination just to hear a bit more. The story is riveting and the characters unforgettable. I have friends lined up wanting to borrow it....it's a must ""hear""!"
1,Worst mushroom book ever seen,"Don't buy it, it's a useless book, why a book without scientific names can work, the paper look like a pocket bible, amazon put this book as it were important but shouldn't be there."
3,Jude Law is a great discovery!,"Jude Law totally steals the show in this thriller as Dickie Greenleaf, an American playboy living it up in Italy. His animal energy flies off the screen and his demise is way too early, leaving the rest of the film gasping in his shadow. Damon and Paltrow add good support and the story is always watchable, but the film completely belongs to Law. A must for armchair travellers, as the characters travel from Naples to Rome to San Remo to Vence."
5,Love it,I bought this cook book for my boss who loves cuban cooking and food .... I think she has made all the recipes
2,The weakest Snoop- Dogg effort yet- This ain't ****!!!!,"When he was with Dre, Snoop was da man in his genre (and I usually prefer blues and rock). This new team robs Snoop of his wonderful originality; it just does't work. Buy another Doggystyle."
5,Sturdy,"I have used these many times over the years and they are durable and large enough to handle lots of documents, receipts, etc. This size is not always easy to find in the local retail market. Very sturdy, shipped promptly, would buy from vendor again."
2,celtic worship,I found the album too restrained and technically correct. Great for a quiet meditation but not stirring to the soul.
2,Apricots were OK but I not sure I would order them again.,I thought the packaging of the individual apricot was not very appealing eventhough in came in a gift box. I thought more should have been included. The number of apricots provided would have been a better indicator than weight.
4,Soothing,"I don't think this CD is as good as Das Testament, by itself. But if you were to listen to that and then this CD it would be good. Why? Because this is like a break from all that growling.Its a very calm CD compared to the other one. Still good. But would probably be better to someone who liked soothing sort of music.Well, none the less, I'll have translations up for this CD on my website (http://www.enomineforus.tk) by the end of this week for those of you who don't speak German."
1,Very poorly written...,"As one who believes that we are free from the Law and tithing, I purchased this book with great expectations of finding more information to add to my studies.This book has to be the worst book I have ever purchased. The author seemed to have something to say but it was buried in a sea of disjointed grammatical syntax, poor punctuation and poorly annotated text.Normally, being a writer myself, I can make my way through the most tenuous writing. But no amount of experience can decipher the words of one who does not write grammatically correct sentences and uses punctuation in such a way so as to cloud the true meaning of what he wrote.The sad truth is that this man has something to say but apparently lacks the necessary writing skills to successfully get his points across to the reader. Don't waste your time and money on this tome as you will not be able to understand it.Yes, it's that bad!"
3,VERY Blue Tie,"It's VERY blue. HOT blue, so if you are looking for ""sky"" blue or a paler blue, this is not the tie for you. But if you are into BLUE as in electric blue, then you can't get more blue than this! It has quality construction."
3,Joe Deserves a Box Set,"I love Joe Walsh and the music on these disks is great. My only real beef is this seems to be geared to the casual fan. The only rarities are The Bomber, with his nod to Bolero, edited out on most collections, and a live take of Ordinary Average Guy with Glenn Frey. Who needs Glenn Frey? Give us some previously unreleased material. I hope there is some in the vaults and that one day Joe will get an extensive anthology."
3,A different view,"First of all, in general it is a well-written book. However, the coverage of the Analytical Section is VERY weak, in my opinion. Repeating ad nauseum that some schools don't bother about Analytical scores does not help when, in your case, they in fact care about it.The math review is very good, but if you *have* background in mathematics or a related field (bear in mind that if it is not your case, just ignore this review), it is near useless. Seeing dozens of pages dedicated to this section and *near none* to the Analytical test is frustrating.If you have to buy only one book and need training in the Analytical section of the GRE, I cannot recommend this book. But if you do not have this need and would like to get a good math review, just read the other opinions."
5,Great Rotisserie & Oven!,"This oven really works great! It's simple to use and easy to clean.... It's a large oven fit for conventional baking as well as rotisserie baked goods. One of its best features is a temperature control that actually works! It really is a multipurpose cooking appliance. As a single male, even I could not [mess] it up!"
5,Grand National: America's Golden Age of Motorcycle Racing,A must have for any fan of flattrack racing. Another example of the excellent writing of Joe Scalzo.
3,Sturdy toy but a little too hard,"This toy is a great educational toy, but because it is made of wood it can be a danger to toddlers who are still into throwing things around and biting things. Some of the pieces could have been better made to look more like the object........the tomato, orange and egg for example just look like coloured shapes."
2,Meandering and juvenile,"Maybe this is one of those books that can only be enjoyed by young adult readers. No longer fitting that category, perhaps I just couldn't relate to a light-hearted tale about nothing of substance.On the plus side, this book contains no gratuitous sex or four-letter words. I can appreciate that. But, try as I might, I couldn't bring myself to appreciate the air-headed protagonist, her ditzy, controlling mother or, really, anyone else in the book. The entire novel felt like attending a dinner party only to end up stuck next to a guest who rattles on all night about the soporific irrelevant. Others praised it, but to me, the humor felt strained--as if, page after page, the author was trying way too hard to be clever. (And what was it with the shameless plugs for the author's musician/husband?)May be just the kind of book a career pageant-chick would find scintillating. But it did nothing for me."
4,A fantastic guilty pleasure,"Point Pleasant was not a good show. It just wasn't. The scripts were average, the acting was sub-par at best and comically wooden at worst. The only thing that this show genuiniely had going for it was a fairly clever storyline.That said, Point Pleasant was an absolute pleasure to watch, not in spite of but because of its trashiness. I think the reason that it was such a great guilty pleasure was that the cast (mostly soap opera cast-offs) knew exactly what the show was and didn't take it too seriously (and maybe even played up the cheese factor intentionally), whereas the director(s) seemed to be going for real, genuine drama. The ensuing absurdity was just irresistable, and TV hasn't seen nearly so endearing a piece of schlock sense."
1,A TOTAL waste of time!,"I've read more interesting novels written for 4th graders. It was trite, lacked any hint of historical facts, the dialogues were silly, the characters lacked substance, and so on.The author had me expecting that at some point Maria would say something like ""gee, golly.""I'd like a refund. Really."
3,Can't Quite Recommend,"This is a pretty good tutorial on the Blues. It contains well thought-out instruction on the pentatonic scales and their relationship to the Blues. However, it has a serious drawback. There are no backing tracks for songs on CD. Also, since it does not provide the tempo (in beats per minute), one has to spend valuable practice time building one's own backing tracks (unless you have your own band handy). These days, there are plenty of tutuorials that include backing tracks, as well. For this very reason, I cannot recommend it."
3,The world's dumbest criminals caught on film!,"The first half of the movie runs tight and suspenseful. But the trick with these kinds of movies is that once the hostages escape, the movie is pretty much over. This leads to some pretty lame developments which I won't reveal. But here's a hint: You know those horror movies where the victim escapes the attacker and runs upstairs instead of downstairs? It's kind of like that. It's like an episode of The World's Dumbest Criminals or The World's Dumbest Hostages. The ending somehow doesn't feel satisfying, because everything that comes before it just gets lamer and lamer. It is well-filmed and directed, though. I give three stars for Nicolas Cage and Nicole Kidman, and the daughter who looks like a young Sasha Grey. And I will continue to support these first releases on streaming video, mainly because I'm too lazy to get dressed and drive to a sticky movie theater with people chomping on popcorn and slurping up soft drinks out of livestock buckets."
2,Mediocre and suspicion-forming,"Mediocre attempt - does not seem to fulfill authors stated intent or that of the title. Wanders into apologetic ramblings about race and creed, largely without advancing any evidence for his reasoning - only statistically unsupported ideas. Prologue of book instantly made me suspicious of possible scholarly dishonesty and the following chapters did nothing to allieve me of this concern. I finished the book, I feel, about as knowledgeable as I began it - the information may as well not have been read because I cannot consider it as trustworthy, and must discard most of it outright."
5,Great Book,Letty fell in love with Richard the day she ran over him while riding on a cow and he was riding on a horse. Everyone knew it too. From that moment every meeting is painful - for Richard. The beginning of the book is no exception. I like the way that Letty is still a klutz throughout the book. I loved this book and really enjoyed Richard and Letty. I love their interaction throughout the book. I loved both Letty and Richard. And I loved this book that was sometimes so hilarious. If you plan on reading a Jill Barnett story this is the one to read. It's the best one of all the one's I've read.
5,Friends in Autumn Jigsaw Puzzle,"Friends in Autumn is a beautiful 1000 piece puzzle, measuring 24"" x 30"".This puzzle beautifully depicts the painting ""Friends in Autumn"" by Fred Swan. The setting is a country home and barn nestled in the valley at the peak of fall.You'll love it."
1,Falsehoods disguised as Christian speaking,"While the comedy on this CD is okay, at best, it's hard to get over the fact that he lies constantly about his life and testimony. While claiming to be repetant about it, he continues to sell this CD on his website, and also has backtracked to claim he only exagerrated. James Frey had his book cancelled and lost his contract with his publisher when he lied about his past story- why do Christian speakers get away with it? Churches must stop sponsoring this man until he comes clean. He does not give God any glory by lying.This CD is full of untruths. Don't pass on lies when the truth will set you free."
1,This thing is crap,This thing is a piece of cheap crap!! Don't waste your money as it does not even work. It came out of the box as a piece of cheap plastic set at 70 degrees and it never changed. I left it in the tank for a few days and the temp gauge never changed. I would never buy again.
4,"Could be better, but not a bad starting point","I think the other reviews are accurate for the most part. For example, as one other reviewer mentions, this book uses a lot of phonetic terms like ""affricative"" and ""labio"" that really frustrated me at first. But using a dictionary, I created a little glossary of all the terms used and as I got to know the terms better, I found the descriptions more helpful than any other source for correct pronunciation. (These descriptions alone are, I think, worth the cost of the book.)Another reviewer mentions that this book doesn't compare any of these sounds to English equivalents. I think this is done to help the student begin the process of ""thinking in Chinese"" which, while frustrating at first, probably pays off down the road.I've used two other books and several Web sites to help me learn Chinese. I don't know if I'd recommend this book by itself, but together with other sources, I think it's invaluable."
5,Amazing Film,Really heartfelt and wonderful story. Superb acting and well directed. Highly recommend it!
4,White Boy Blues,"This disk consists of a series of remade blues songs. None have ever sounded quite like this. Most have smart, rocking arrangements that on first impression sound like Sam Coomes is dabbling, which sound better and better with repeated listening.The third cut, Black Cat Moan, takes the best of what made Led Zepplin great and squeezes it into three minutes of pure pleasure. It's my favorite new song in about a year.The album is kind of a new generation of white-boy blues but purer and with more emotion than you'll find with Jon Spencer (where it's a joke) or the White Stripes (where it's a pose). Plus the sax solo at the end of the disk is terrific."
4,What if this actually happened?,"War of the worlds is the film adaptation of H. G. Wells's story on the radio depicting aliens taking over the earth.The movie does a very good job of portraying what actually would happen using technology and stunning special effects to capture the imagination of the people watching the film.The narration is done by Morgan Freeman, who does a great job. The movie starts out with the mom dropping the 2 kids (Robbie and Rachel) at her ex-husbands house because she is going to Boston to visit her parents! Communications are not going so until a freak lightning storm hits and all Hell breaks lose, leaving Ray (dad) to protect the kids throught all the chaos.Overall it is very good film that really captures your imagination and makes you appreciate nature for all it's worth."
5,One kick butt album!!!,"I love this cd!!!! My friend Kim had gotten this cd for Hanukah when I was at her house and (even though I'm Christian) I got a present too. We immediatley went to listen to her new gift. When my family and I moved from CA to TX, we stopped by a store in NM and I saw the tape she had gotten and my mom bought it for me. I listened to it so much that a year later I broke the tape due to listening to it so often! Then my dad got me the cd for my b-day along w/ the Sign and a huge sterio system. I was very excited. The song that is really kickin' is Just an Image, even though all the songs are just out of this world. 10 stars!! Boy you guys really know how to make an album!! Keep up the fab work!!!!!! love Virginia"
1,Disappointing,I was very disappointed to find only black & white drawings of the insects.....a key part to identifying is color. I returned it for a refund.
1,Horrible Book,"McNab's book, Liberation Day, is the worst book I have ever tried to wade through. First, the book is confusing. He has an obsessive/compulsive need to use acronyms for everything under the sun. Instead of simply writing out the words or describing the action, he has to use some type of code word initials that we are supposed to learn as we read. I am on page 130 and I think he has already made up about 35 or 40 of these stupid code acronyms. Thankfully, I only paid 5.95 for the book, or I would ask him to refund my money. I just wish I had a fireplace so I could use it for kindling. Hey, Andy... find a day job, you are gonna need it.By the way, Amazon needs to have 1/4 and 1/2 stars since some books can not rise to the level of getting 1 star."
4,Awesome!,"This is a 'must-own' CD from Mariah. It contains some of her best hits such as ""Heartbreaker"", ""Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)"" and ""Thank God I Found You"". This album includes vocals from ""Jay-Z"", ""Usher"", ""Da Brat"", ""Missy Elliott"", ""Snoop Dogg"", ""Joe"" and ""98 Degrees"". This album comes with a mini poster inside. So, own her ""Rainbow"" CD now!"
1,Boiler fail to shut off after 10 months of using,The water kettle works great for about 10 months until one day it has stopped to automatically shut off by itself. It can be quite dangerous if I was not around when the first time it has happened. I could have burned the apartment down!
5,Sinus infection,This products works really well for me when I have a sinus infections coming on. I get relief from the pain the same day I start using the spray.
3,"Interesting facts, but what do you do with them?","I'll make my review short and sweet. I applaud Jason for his efforts. It took a lot of guts to do what he did. He is a very bright person with great potential. For a freshman book, it is not bad. I will make one, and only one criticism. He should have collaborated with a seasoned forensic pyschologist in order to give this book some real bite. Maybe in his sophomore effort he will give this a try. I look forward to Jason's future productions. If I didn't study so hard for law school, I probably would have done the same. Happy reading!"
1,Dd not receive,I paid for this product and then I did not even receive the product. Do not go through this company. You may not receive your product and then you are out money.
1,Product does not fit the shape of your foot.,I had bought this product to help with some of my overlapping toes. I feel I wasted my money. The product does not fit my foot at all. While wearing it the pad part sticks out an inch past my foot making it very inconvenient. I was hoping to find something I could wear with my shoes. This did not work for me.
3,So-So scale,If you are two feet tall this could be an excellent scale. When you are six feet tall its impossible to read your exact weight unless you have the eyesight of an eagle.
1,BUYER BEWARE ~ total scam!!!,"got this battery at the beginning of March to replace RAZR battery that wouldn't last a day anymore (it originally would last 2-3 days on average amount of usage) upon receiving it, this battery would only hold a charge about a day and as of now (mid-june) it no longer will take a charge.in other words, this IS NOT an OEM Motorola battery, please avoid."
4,Most amazing!!,"I discovered Adam back in the early 80's, seeing the Antmusic video on MTV and other places. I imediately bought King's of the Wild Frontier, and loved it. To this day it is still one of my favorites. Shortly after buying that, I got my hands on the US version of Dirk, and was equally pleased with it. The one day, I ran across a cassette copy of the original Do It 1979 release, and snagged it. I thought it was so much better in ways, than the US version. I still have that cassette to this day. When this remaster came out a couple years back, I was THRILLED to see it was a remaster of the original version.The remastered CD is amazing, with much more clarity and energy than my cassette could provide. I love all eras of Ant Music, but the first two albums hold a nearer, dearer place in my mind."
4,I liked this one,"This is the first James Patterson book I have listened to, but I really enjoyed it. I took it to the beach and for three days that is what I did. Sat at the beach and listened. I thought it moved fast and was a very good story. Even though some of it was predictible, it was a nice way to spend my vacation. I would recommend it."
2,Disappointing,"I realize that this was not an expensive bag, but I thought it would at least have handles so as to make it easier to carry. If I had only looked a bit closer and realized that there were none. I cannot recommend this bag to anyone except possibly to someone who will only use it to/from car, i.e. not while running through airports, and needs to save money. Poor product."
3,More for younger babies,"I read the reviews and they were so good that I had to get my son this cute toy. But when it came in the mail a few days ago, he was less then thrilled with his new toy. I still think it is so cute, and I am hoping that he will come to enjoy this little toy, but at 8 months old I think he is beyond this little cutie. He looked at it and found the bug, the crinkly wings, the mirror, and then tossed it :0(. He played with it for less then a min., and then was board. To be fair most of the reviews were about younger babies enjoying this toy, so I think I just found it too late. Oh well. I will keep trying, but I think he will keep throwing it down."
3,I've seen better.,"The package arrived on time but a little beat up. It was mostly the packaging that was damaged but there was one side of the bench that was bent and stopped it form opening fully. It wasn't bad enough to make me return it I just had to bend it back into place. Ive used a couple of earlier models of this bench where both wooden parts of the top move with a turn of the handle but with this one the back is stationary and only the front moves, other than that its sturdy and holds up to most of what a diy'er can throw at it. If your looking for a cheap bench for a few projects a year then get it. if its gonna be an every day use type of thing spend a little extra cash and get something a little more well built."
5,The cutting edge,"The best effort since For those about to rock.This album has some classics like Thunderstruck and Moneytalks.All the songs are played very technically, proving the virtuosism of the Young brothers.Very Good!"
5,bada bing!,"I waited sleeplessly for this treasured gem to arrive. Not even the 1980s 'intro to German language' class on the local public broadcast and a nonstop swill of temperanillo could soothe my nerves. But alas, it is now firmly entrenched in my steel grip. Til death do us part? Hah! Posh! They are going to have to bury me with this bad boy.Thanks for the juice,Rock-on!Sweet Cheese"
4,Avatar of later works,"A little difficult to read in that the cast of characters is immense, and keeping track of them is not always easy. One can see in this first ambitious novel an avatar of the form she so masterfully developed, particularly with respect to the dialogue, in the first two books of her prize-winning ""Thomas Cromwell"" series which I have read twice (and for those books, family trees and ""notes on the cast"" are provided for readers who need help with the history. Something similar might also have helped for ""A Place of Greater Safety"". Parts of this book were wonderful; parts were somewhat tedious. I remain a huge fan of Mantel's."
5,A revolutionary worldview for Americans,"Along with the original series of Star Trek which premiered the same year of 1966, this movie formed the basis for a paradigm shift for many Americans, at least for those of us young enough to have our minds changed through popular culture. As a 12 year old, I can remember what an effect this movie had on me when it was released. I grew up in the Cold War era. My house had a bomb shelter and we practiced routines in school in preparation for a Soviet nuclear attack. This film was a revelation to me--suggesting that the citizens of Soviet Russia might be human beings with whom I had something in common, rather than being mere minions of an ""evil Empire."" I am happy to say that the movie has held up remarkably well, unlike some others from the same era. This movie must have been risky to make at the time--would that we should have more such risk-takers!"
3,Organizm,"Organizm is a pretty solid movie that suffers from two problems. The movie contradicts itself at times, and some of the most atrocious CGI and green screen work I have ever seen. Bad CGI usually doesn't bother me because its par for the course in low budget movies, but it is just so bad that it deterred me from fully enjoying the movie. And another problem is that the movie seemed to have some sort of budget because everything else about it was pretty good, so the CGI issue really is unforgivable. Now thus far it may seem as though I'm bashing the movie, but I did enjoy it. In fact, if the CGI had been in the hands of more competent individuals, then this would have received a four star rating easily. But as it stands, we are left with a nice Sci-Fi / Horror time killer worthy of watching, but just don't expect the next classic here."
4,Healing Yoga for Aches and Pains,The tape help with my hip and back pain. I was able to get back to walking and continue my normal activities.
2,Big time problems but I love the unit,We are on our 3rd unit in 2 years. Two of the units had electronic problems and 1 leaked all over the place. I love the idea but they MUST get better quality control. To Conair's credit they have replaced all 3 units. The first 2 cost $10 each plus the return postage and the last one they sent it free of charge but I still had to pay for postage $12.
4,Can't go wrong with GI Joe...,"except that it was a gift for my nephew and I paid to have it delivered 2-3 days and it showed up 8 days later, AFTER his birthday, even after they said they had shipped it the day I ordered it. I was very upset. He loves it and plays with it all the time. Great product, bad service."
2,O-Ring Seal does not fit when locking,"The product is solid and looks nice but is flawed by a miss-sized O-Ring. The job of the rubber O-Ring is to keep dirt and water out of the locking mechanism. There is a groove for the O-Ring to sit in, however you will notice that this product can not be reassembled without the O-Ring pulling out of the grove and getting caught outside. This of course defeats the use of the O-Ring for sealing.I thought that this may have been a defective item so I returned to Amazon for a replacement. The replacement item had exactly the same issue. I contacted Master Lock by phone regarding the issue. The representative was not helpful telling me that there are no know issues with the product and to exchange it for a new one.I will now send back the replacement lock for a full refund. Good thing for Amazon's return policy!"
1,Not very funny at all,I have always had fun watching movies with Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis. I figured this movie would be very funny with the both of them. I ended up being extremely disappointed. This was not funny at all and seemed to drag on forever. If you have seen the trailer for this movie that was the funniest this movie gets. There is nothing else good in this movie. Take time to buy other great Christmas movies and don't spend Christmas with the Kranks.
5,A great book about a great driver,"Mark Martin has always been a class act in NASCAR, and this book lives up to Martin's reputation. The photos are a great collection, and the text is interesting and has a depth not usually found in a driver bio.For the Mark Martin fan who wants an in-depth look at the man, or for the general NASCAR fan who wants a great archive of photos, a this is a must-have book."
5,The Greatest Films of Our Time!,Lord of the Rings is nonstop action with hints of comedy and romance. All three movies are amazing! Peter Jackson did a great job of making the books become real. These movies have inspired me to read the books!
1,"Poor design, and it failed too.","I was looking forward to increasing my connection capacity with this 7 port hub (currently have a 4 port), but was disappointed in the design of this unit. The 2-piece design (hub and base) seems like a good idea but doesn't really work well. They include a stick-on foam strip to help keep the hub attached to the base, but this is clearly an after-thought to correct the problem users had with the hub slipping out of the base. I ended up setting the base aside and just using the main hub component. Oh, and it also failed to work! The main cable connecting the hub to the computer had a poor connection at the hub that caused any attached device to work intermittently - not a pleasant experience. Returned unit for credit after attempting to use it for one day."
3,fiesta ware,"I have many place setting of fiesta ware, this was a gift from my husband, and I like the color, but the cup was broken when we opened it."
1,Just doesn't work,"This worked well on an older PC, but does not work on current versions of XP: you just get a message regarding inappropriate sound drivers and gracefully exit. There is nothing relevant in the readmes, and no online help from the firm.A few days after I wrote this I tracked down the company, now Global Software Publishing. There is a patch which will fix the XP problem at: [...] Turn off virus protection software first. Still no reason why Max OSX isn't supported even though the package says it is, but apparently buying an upgrade to version 1.2 might fix that problem."
1,"Inexcusable, especially from Dylan","Seriously, this rivals Self-Portrait and Planet Waves as his alltime worst. When Dylan's lyrics are weak, that robs all purpose of listening to the music. Guess what? They're mostly weak here (Drifting too Far from the Shore; Maybe Someday; Precious Memories; Under Your Spell). Guess what else? The tunes themselves are mostly weak: no memorable melodies, no virtuoso or even good (or even crappy, for that matter) performances, nothin'. And don't even get me started on that children's choir found on They Killed Him... baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad idea. Most of these songs are cut-cut-cut-rate love songs. The exception is Brownsville Girl. His lyrics are at their best. But those booming drums, backing vocals and horns are distracting. Would've been a great solo acoustic performance.Here's one for the trash."
4,Voyage,"I'm sorry Sterling Hayden only wrote two books because I think he could have been one of the greats. But as with his acting career, he dropped out early, (although I must say I think he was a much better author than an actor). I read Voyage many years ago and went on to read ""The Wanderer"" his autobiographical work. Voyage is about a sailor and the hardships of the sea in the late 1800s. It also deals with the labor union movements of that era. A victim of McCarthyism which ended his acting career, Sterling Hayden's political agenda, in my opinion, was evident in this book. As a sailor I enjoyed it for its realism of the sea and would compare it to Richard Henry Dana's classic ""Two Years Before the Mast""."
3,Could have cleaned up the sound,The songs are great but as for the sound? You would think with today's technology there would be less airy/scratchy background noise. I kind of expected better audio quality than what I got. If you are looking for that old timey feel to the music. This version delivers.
1,It does not live up to Logitech brand name,I bought this webcam yesterday and its performance is way below expectations. The camera performs pathetically in low light. The pictures were grainy and video capture is equally bad.This camera is not worth its money.
2,Unwieldy and ineffective,"Didn't like this product at all. It is very difficult to handle and the curls, if at all you get them, come out in a weird shape. Product didn't come with good ""how to"" instructions either. Not recommended."
4,Great source of information,"Despite the comments about the recipes (none of which I have tried), I liked the book - especially the organization of it, the way the foods are listed with their important vitamin/mineral/etc. I think it is a very good book to have for any mother or father, as a source of reference, even if the recipes aren't used b/c at least you know what food is providing your child with what nutrient. I checked it out at the library, read it and wanted it immediately. My mother saw it on my coffee table, read it and also wanted it just for herself."
3,It's repeatable fun,"it's not a gret movie, it's not perfect, but it's enjoyable fun. Topping it off with Lucy Liu as her most adorable part in years makes it good for a repeatable film. It's not Big Trouble in Little China, or The Last Dragon (my reigning champs for the 5-10 times a year type movie)...but what is?"
1,ughh,Linkin Park is just a rock version of the many manufactured boy bands there are out there. The songs are average and dull. It's all a scam. Don't buy into it.
4,"Quick, fun read","Charlaine Harris has done a great job mixing it up with her first of the Southern Vampire Mysteries. From mystery, to supernatural and even (gasp) romance, this book is a quick read. It never takes itself too seriously and who doesn't love a heroine who can kick some butt? For those of you into the TrueBlood TV series, you'll find this fairly different from the series' story line. But don't despair, the books give you added insight and are just as entertaining. Bottom line: if you're wanting to pass a few hours of indulgent fun, pick up Dead Until Dark and enjoy!"
1,"Tainted ""truth""","It did not require much effort to realize that the ""truth"" as depicted in Fahrenheit 911, ""the democrat's titillator""(you wont find it in the Websters - titallator is my coinage), was to some degree tainted by the predilections of the director.Similarly it shouldn't take too much calorie burn in the neurons to realize that the ""proclaimed truths"" in this book was distorted by the slanderous motives of the publisher, whose notoriety is succinctly captured by the recent New Yorker (Aug 9-16, pp 38) - ""the Publisher is Regnery, which had a best-seller not long ago with a volume alleging that the Clintons hung prophylactics from the branches of the White House Christmas tree"""
3,Heating Pad,The heating pad works well but it has an automatic shut off that only stays on for up to 60 minutes which doesn't work for me and my fibromyalgia. Also it is very small. Not large enough for much of anything.
4,Good matt nude lipstick,It's got a nice warm scent of vanilla-like smell. Texture is creamy. Meadow Sweet is a nice nude color. Can't apply too much or else it'll look a bit dry.
2,label patches everywhere,"in the picture it shows the jacket plain black with orange inside. when i got it it patches all over it saying the name brand, that were velcro so when i pulled them off i had velcro patches all over the outside of the jacket. i had to take it to a seamstress to have them removed. the kind of material would have been easy to damage if i had tried to remove them myself. i was very disapointed and will never order from them again."
3,Not what I was looking for,"If I had been able to see each month as it appears in the calendar I would have chosen another one. My overall impression is battle scenes and dark colors. I wanted space shots with exotic planets, moons, nebula. It's nicely done, just not what I wanted."
5,Les is one funky-*** son of a ***-a!!!!,"This is an amazing album. Instrumentally superb is this album which utilizes some of the music world's greatest guitarists to play along side its best bassist. The Tom Morello produced tracks are stand-outs and most of the album show- cases Primus at its very best. There are a couple of deviations from the norm such as ""Eclectic Electric"" and ""Coattails of a dead man"" and each is very amusing and not altogether out of place on this wonderful album. Lyrically, Les Claypool's story telling lyrics have aged like fine wine and are at their best on tracks such as ""Laquer Head"", ""The Anti-pop"" and ""Natural Joe"" which are all fantastic songs. At the moment this is my favorite Primus album but that always changes, and if you loved this, then you should buy them all."
2,Dullsville,This book did not hold my interest at all. A little S&M not even done in a manner to be arousing to me.
2,1.5* for Cheesy Graphic Novel quality,"What could have been a great character study - a Feminist determined to provide her daughter with a wholesome life while she watches Mom take her clothes off on stage; who still fights an impulse towards exhibitionism - emerges as foolish, pandering pulp.So we have a great writer and two fine actors (Moore and Reynolds) delivering something pretty embarassing. Reynolds is awful as the sleazy politician who has his own urge to drop his pants in public.That said, Demi Moore is *the* reason to watch this movie, beginning to end. She acts well, and dances even...weller."
1,I can't believe it has such a high rating.,"Essh. Don't buy this router. I'm pretty sure it has such a high rating because people don't give it enough time. A friend recommended this router to me Sept 02. The first router I received had loads of white noise. Living in NYC means cramped apartments, and my computer(s) are in my bedroom. Was impossible to sleep w/ it plugged in. So, I complained and got a second shipped (as my friend's had no audible noise). Same white noise.I was fed up but needed a router so, hoping for the best, just lived w/ it and unplugged the router every night. Lately though, after having the router for less than a year, my cable (RR) connection started dropping. Bypass the router, everything's fine, connect the router, connection drops. This morning, plug in the router and nada. It's dead, no pwr lights. For what it's worth, my friend's router also died two weeks ago.I'd seriously stay away from this manufacturer."
4,Specialty recordings with two Vee-Jays,"[Based upon Amazon.com ""Sample"" audition]The 12 Specialty session tracks sound fine; the two, later, Vee-Jay tracks are LR remakes of ""Ooh My Soul"" and ""Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On"".""Ooh My Soul"" is the very abundant 1964 version, a different sound for Richard, a Latinesque beat, but it's clear his voice is not in shape. ""Shakin'"" is Richard's first release on Vee-Jay, a regional hit, and quite possibly featuring Jimi Hendrix. Sound is muddy on this frenetic mover - but the performance overcomes such objections. One of the most exciting instrumental breaks in History!"
1,3 of 3 I've seen are garbage.,"I own this, and 2 of my friends own them. They seemed like a great deal 2 years ago, better than the ipod of the time. 3 out of 3 are now almost useless. huge problems uploading files. huge problems with hardware. huge problems with sound and playback.Buy an ipod. apple knows what they are doing"
4,More Answers Than You Would Expect!,"I read Out on a Limb when I was fourteen-years-old, and the book acknowledged every doubt and every idea that I had thought of growing up with Christian ideals: fate, the afterlife, the soul, etc. Shirley MacLaine introduces her personal faith from the beginning and systematically details her progression into the spiritual teacher that she is to this day. MacLaine also seems to possess a sixth sense as to the questions that her readers will encounter as they read her novel and answers them in a very clear and concise manner (if you're not careful, the material can be quite daunting).My only outstanding complaint about this novel is that MacLaine had to account for every facet of her and Jerry's relationship. It proved to be quite distracting and I did not feel that Jerry's extra-marital affair with Shirley was necessary for a book of this nature."
3,More could have happened,"Madagascar is a very funny movie. Seeing animals like a zebra, a giraffe and a lion behave like people is always funny, especially when voiced by Ben Stiller, Chris Rock and David Schwimmer (who was funnier then I would expect). On Madagascar it's Sasha Baron Cohen (Ali G) who steals the show.The animation is perfect, never have seen animals move in such a way.Another very funny thing are references to other movies like Planet of the Apes, American Beauty and the Matrix.The only thing is... the story is flimsy, there is really not that much happening. If you read other reviews you will have a very good understanding of the story, it's really sad that such great animation has been made for such a flimsy storyline."
2,Taras Bulba DVD Review,Taras Bulba is a pretentious film with poor dialogue and phony characters. The only decent thing about this film is Franz Waxman's musical score.
3,I'll Show You how to Robot,"For the most part the Dvd is pretty good. The parts that actually show Tyson--the instructor--are very helpful. There is no doubt he knows what he is talking about and he is a very great dancer. However, lots of the movie is advertising his friends or believe it or not the movie, The Secret. Which is about quantum physics. I would rate this dvd with 5 stars in a second if it didn't get off subject or advertise other crap. He even shows your around his appartment and the dirty sponge he uses to clean dishes with. Worth seeing the dance parts. You can find them on Youtube."
5,Personal and Real,The monologs in this book are real and can be used in many ways. It is clear that the writer used many real stories and situations.
3,Good Product that will help,"The CLEP Western Civilization II book is a significantly summarized version of events from 1648 to present. Containing just 136 pages of reading material, it does offer two practice exams at the end containing 240 questions. I've always had an interest in history and possess a fair knowledge of events and time-lines. The CLEP test was very difficult; I received a barely passing grade of 54. I actually thought for sure I failed, due to frequent guessing! I Recommend this summary be read first, then go on to another textbook for supplemental information."
4,Correction on country of origin,"I am posting because the product desription is not correct. Otherwise, it does appear as advertised. I cannot comment on the drill's performance because I have not used it yet...so my star rating doesn't count for much at this point...I will update this review when I start my first project.One of the reason's I bought it was the ""Made in USA"" description in the ""more technical details"" link...but when I got it, it said ""Manufactured in Mexico."" This may not matter to others, but it is better to be accurately informed before you buy...also, a case would be a nice addition for such a nice-looking and powerful tool! Good luck to all!"
3,One Hour of Matisse's Paintings,"That's what this DVD comes down to, 56 minutes of watching Matisse's paintings click by in chronological order. If you are a fan of Matisse, buy it. If you aren't, netflix it. This DVD is simply a slide show with narration. The narration leaves much to be desired, as it is very monotone. The biggest drawback is that you don't know which of the paintings are going to be talked about in detail or just have their titles given. If you are looking for a deep study or understanding of Matisse's oeuvre, you should keep looking. This DVD is more along the lines of an undergrad paper."
3,Overall pretty good except...,"Very nice...however mine had some rust inside so I had to return it. Maybe it was just mine. Otherwise, I couldn't find anything less of its value."
5,Excellent,"This was an excellent book. In the spirit of a fast paced novel, Swanson puts us on the roller coaster that was the assasination of President Lincoln and the chase for his killer: John Wilkes Booth. Swanson is a fantastic author. I stumbled upon this book and was so happy with the find. I could read it again today. I suggest you do as well - you will enjoy it. JVD"
3,Heart of the dove,I found the book very interesting but was bored in some spots and I liked her vampire series much better.
4,An enjoyable comic...,"I am not really a Batman fan; nor, for that matter, am I a comics fan. I am, however, a genre fan, and I love the whole Predator mythos. This comic book has wonderful, dark artwork, really keeping the mood going, and the predator ""cloaking"" effect looks pretty cool here. The scripting is pretty good for the most part, and while the plot isn't great, it doesn't have to be -- Batman and the Predator duke it out! The action is a little confusing at times, but mostly it works well.The thing that bugged me most is that the predator played back recorded speech far too often, and in far too apropriate places. But his code of honor is there, his weapons are there...My only real complaint about this graphic novel is that the pages are normal comic paper instead of the glossier ""collected edition"" paper to which I've become accustomed.I recommended this book to fans of either of the title characters -- one of the better comics I've read in a while."
2,A Rip Off,"The title, Bix Restored, is a bit illusive, unless by ""restored"" you mean dragging the master tapes around behind a truck over broken glass.As for the music, very few cuts on the first couple CD's even have a cornet solo!When you consider that the Hot Fives and Sevens collection is only twenty five dollars it becomes obvious that these publishers should be put in jail for charging this much dough."
3,Didn't meet expectations,"I don't think this is what anybody would expect from the Paris we knew and loved on AI. With the exception of the last 2 tracks (now that's more like it!), overall I think the music is just okay and/or mediocre. I can do without the ""Princess P"" as well."
1,Piece of crap,"I realize this was cheap, and you clearly get what you pay for. The earpiece volume was way too loud, almost deafening, with no way to adjust it, yet the microphone part did not work well enough. The only way for someone to hear me speak was for the microphone to literally be resting on my lips. If you think you are getting a good deal on this thing, you are not."
4,Surprisingly Good,Going into the theaters to watch this movie I expected some half hearted attempt to make money kind of movie. But surprisingly this movie was beyond any expectation. Nicholas Cage did an excellent job of acting along with the rest of the cast. A well written script and good directing made this movie a find. A good buddy movie.
1,A Failure of a CD,"Not being a fan of metal, I would still rate The Art of Rebellion with a full 5 stars, lush with good tunes. This is not the case with this CD, oh no. Poor 2 mins attempt at speed-punk metal, it is annoying music for 80% of this CD, you do not even feel like headbanging. A couple of good tracks save the lot (ie Institutionalized), but not worth your money. Dive towards The Art of Rebellion instead."
4,Comes with Donald engine and coal tender car,"This does not come with a Thomas and gold Thomas as pictured, but rather with a black wooden Donald engine and matching coal tender car with the number ""9"" on the side. If you look closely you will see on the DVD box pictured that it says ""Donald"" above the pocket that holds the trains so I was expecting this and was not disappointed, however, if you want the trains in the picture you won't get them. That said, the video is a Thomas video and our 2 year old loves it, it contains 7 episodes and a running time of 39 minutes, plus 60 minutes of ""bonus features"" such as 2 sing-along songs, a ""DVD game"" called Sodor Spelling Game and a ""chracter gallery"". I haven't checked these out. Overall a great deal as long as you are expecting a Donald set!"
4,Odd choices but you can't argue with the music,".This CD is mostly tracks from Bish's first two albums, plus a couple of themes from movies.Nothing wrong with that I guess. You can't argue with the quality of the music. Many of us grew up on those first two albums and hold them in great affection. They are, justifiably, classics.The theme from Animal House is hardly recognizable as Bish, and really just a novelty on here, while the theme from ""Tootsie"" fits in nicely, even if Bish didn't write it himself.Trouble is, this collection offers nothing new, so perhaps you'd be better sticking with the original albums while they're still available, or grabbing Bish's excellent new stuff from his website."
3,Not Up To Par,"Normally when I read a book by these two authors I can easily polish it off in a few days. This one seemed to take forever. The story starts off fine. A body is found in the attic of a fabulous Long Island estate. There is a claw print scorched into the wall, and the stench of sulphur chokes the air. With a beginning like that, you'd think it would be a great book, but it seemed to drag on forever. I think that Preston and Child were trying to write an epic story, but the excesses of the story turned it into an epic bore. This could have been a more interesting book if it had been shorter and less epic in its sweep. A surfeit of good things bores me, and that is what Preston and Child did in this book. It can't hold a candle to The Cabinet of Curiosities."
1,A major disappointment,"I can only agree with the previous review posted by mnyby: this DVD is a major disappointment. Not only short on Byrds material, but poorly presented with distracting features. Anyone who buys this is likely to know who the Byrds are, so we don't need the intrusive captions. This is NOT the original Byrds, by the way, the reviewer who said it is doesn't know what he's talking about. This is the ""Skip Battin era"" Byrds when Roger McGuinn was the only original member. Hopefully one day Byrds fans will get something better than this on DVD."
2,Saving Faith,"A little ""faith' is needed to stick with this book. But, give it to page 50 and the plot begins to come together. There are more initials...CIA, DDO, FBI, CTC, PAC, etc. in the first few chapters, than Liz Taylor's monogrammed towels. The plot coasts along, in predictable hate/love/hate/love fashion, until someone has a close call with death. The punchline ending is the best part of Baldacci's talent, as it features a few surprises. The ""bad guys"" are revealed and everyone lives happily ever after, under the safe umbrella of some ""initials""."
2,A let down.,Much of this book was merely a retelling of what happened in Arthur. It's major virtue is that it helps clear up the end of the last one.
1,she should be called N. Ta-- No Talent,"She has a TERRIBLE VOICE..which everyone knows from her horrib Grammy performance with ""husband"" Marc Anthony. This CD is boring and noise pollution.Boo to you J.Lo"
4,WHY,(As a cat lover) I wish my cat could look at this book. I am sure he would be entertained!! The enhancement of a beautiful animal is much appreciated. I love it when children look at this book. Their comments are wonderful.
4,A good start...,"OK, let's say it straight away. I have the McPheever. I was rooting for my girl Kat since the beginning of the show. However, I'm trying to make this review as unbiased as possible.1. My Destiny ~ This song is OK... it's a little boring, like others have said before, but from a musician's standpoint, I think that the key is wrong for Kat's voice. While she still sounds great, if the key had been a couple of steps lower, she might have sounded a tad bit better. Also, is the modulation necessary at the end? Come on! 3/5 stars2. Somewhere Over the Rainbow ~ This is a beautifully sung and arranged version of the classic song that propelled Kat to the Final 2. She sang this song very well on AI, and she has changed it up a bit on this arrangment. Her voice sounds very good, and the bluesy kind-of sound does wonderful things for her. 4/5 starsHopefully her album is more of a hitmaker than this single... good luck to her."
3,Disappointed!,I don't know why every movie has to be ruined by cussing and nudity. I know that the true Amish are very humble and modest people. To see an Amish woman stand in front of a man naked was sad to see. It really wasn't necessary to do that to get the point across.
1,Power supply without power cord,"This article does not include power cords, amazon not specify, I think it was a mistake to buy this item"
4,Fiskars pruning Stik,"I love it"" I have arthritis in my hands and I have no problem using it. I highly recommend it!"
2,Missed Opportunity!,"Great concept for a story, however, the writers missed this one by many miles! Uma Thurmans character was a little over the top. The story missed many, many opportunities to explore the content they actually brought up. Some of the things you see in the trailer were not nearly as funny as you thought it would be. There is just so much more they could have done, yet they choose to lean on the obsurd, stupid and idiotic."
3,Good enough for the reader with a casual interest,"Alfred Guilaume has done well to write a relatively short book on Islam which is easy to read yet covers all major areas.However, the book would have been of greater value had it been referenced thoroughly. For example a lot of readers really would want to know the actual source of the satanic verses rather than take Guillaumes word that the people who transmitted the tradition 'were good muslims' and they had no reason to lie."
1,Minus33 thermal top,"These were pricey & I would have expected more for the price I paid. They are warm, they are soft, they are a little thin but no thinner than other brands of mid weight wool thermal underwear. My problem with them is that they have developed what appears to be moth holes in the tops & bottoms. The top was worse than the bottoms; the holes began appearing after the first wash & every time I wash them (hand wash) they have more holes.If they had been manufactured with better quality control & were thicker I would definitely be in love. But alas the hole issue is too much to bear with a product of this price. Too bad but I'll try a different brand next time."
4,Received in time and product met my expectations,"look forward to read this book!Read two other books by David King, he is writing history in a most entertaining way."
5,lost,"While reading an interview with Lee Child in the New York Times book review. Mr Childs recommended this book. If Lee Childs liked it, I wanted to read it and I was not disappointed, read on"
4,Grips were great!,"The shipping was great, received the grips quickly. They were excellent - and much cheaper than any motorclcle website I found. The ONLY problem I had was the glue to attach the grips was dried out. I didn't contact the company, because at the point where we discovered the glue was dry, we couldn't wait to a replacement or we would be waiting without a bike! We had a tube of super glue, so it worked out fine."
1,Lack of Quality Control,I recently bought this scale for my family. It arrived damaged and would not operate at all. I contacted the manufacturer who referred me to the seller. The seller replaced the unit but the second one arrived damaged as well. It worked once and then never worked again. I returned that to the seller and requested a refund. It may be accurate; if you get one that works right out of the box. My experience is that I wouldn't give them a third try.
1,"Not well researched, poor scholarship on a good day","When I heard this guy on the radio (KFI AM640) I wondered if he was sane. I bought and read the book and found it to be full of holes. He brings nothing of substance to the table. He misquotes, quotes out of context, shows no understanding of Greek (uses Latin as his referance), uses poor referances, almost all secondary sources, did not read the JAMA article from 1988, does not understand Church history, and just about everything else.When the light of day is shined on this work it is worthless, shallow, vain and seen as a knee jerk reaction.There are far better books on the subject. If you really want to try to prove Christianity is not true. This one is just flat out LAME!Just as a warning if you really try to prove that Christianity is a falsehood you might just be in for more then you would bargin for.Have a GREAT day!"
4,This cute book works on two levels.,"It is a sweet tale about dogs for children, explaining why puppies sometimes misbehave or act up. It has also been pointed out that if you transpose the word men for puppy and/or dog, it is quite amusing on another level, as a basic explanation on why men sometimes misbehave or act up."
5,best movie in a long time,All the acting was so good in this movie. You go on a ride watching this. I wasnt laughing every second but it was so well written and very original.
2,Heating pad,"I think it is overpriced for what it is but it does work to some extent. There really isn't much heat from the ""magic coils"" -- whatever. Would I buy it again -- NO."
4,Buena.,"La historia es buena y para estar tan resumida, pues dura mas o menos cinco horas, está bien contada. Se entiende la historia, eso si, las sub-historias las cortaron todas pero al final uno se entera de ellas."
5,Dental Anatomy,The book is great with helpful pictures and interactive cd and as a dental student very helpful to order online.
3,"Where do all these people who love ""Another Thing Comin'"" come from?","I mean, Judas Priest's biggest hit (no wonder it's their biggest hit, it's also their worst song) is repetitive, lame, and boring as hell. The last 1.5 minutes of the song consist of the chorus repeated OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER... you get the point? Other than that, it's a great album,(especially Electric Eye) but that one stupid song pulls it down. I'm gonna buy Sad Wings of Destiny instead - and you should too!"
4,take that live,"fantasic and fun performances of take that live. this is minus robbie williams but the vocals are strong and the sets are over the top. it has a few moments of corney, but overall it is watchable. i am not big on circus themed anything, but there is enough distraction and good harmonies that you can easily get distracted!"
1,"Just another ""Best Of"" CD, only worse.","What you have here is yet another of several Best of Talk Talk collections that are out there and this one is likely the worst yet due to the fact Essential has copy protection technology on it that can keep you from putting the music onto a mix CD or transfer to an MP3 player.You get the EXACT same tracks as are on their first compilation album, Natural History. The difference is Essential is probably remastered (unconfirmed, and would only make a difference on the earlier tracks), but Natural History has two additional live tracks (LIFE'S WHAT YOU MAKE IT and TOMORROW STARTED). Considering Natural History is about half the price, gives you more music AND has no digital rights management software to keep you from moving the music where you want I think it's a no brainer on which one to get (not this one)."
3,"Collection, not an Introduction","I am interested in Tomine's work as I have seen examples everywhere, so I got this book. It did confirm works that I suspected were his, such as the Weezer Posters, areas that I knew his work before like the New Yorker Illustrations, and describe the origin of some of his more reproduced works. That said, I would not recomend it as a way to get into the more personal work of Tomine. The best parts of the book are a collection of pre-Optic Nerve comics, one of which occurs twice, the second time naming names."
4,The kids love it!,"Both my 4 year old and 2 year old love this book. The story is a little hard to follow, but they don't mind. It has a nice message about sharing and is the perfect length for a bedtime book."
2,"A bit scary for younger kids, beware if you are used to modern Samurai-era Power Rangers","My exposure to Power Rangers stuff has been the typically corny battle scenes and dialogue, but otherwise harmless characters. And in the case of Power Rangers Samurai, the characters are actually pretty thoughtful and try to teach a lesson. So when I saw the positive reviews for this movie, I thought it was a slam-dunk. But about a quarter through, my 5 year old was scared and wanted to turn it off. We persevered a bit, but some of the bad guys in this are really gross and creepy. Probably fine for older kids, but just be aware that this is a different vibe from the modern stuff."
5,Very good service but...,"The plants arrived just fine and really fast. They looked fine on arrival. Over time however, the shock of travel has had its toll. I am quite good at making my plants survive and thrive and so I have somehow managed to save them but they are no longer in the lush condition they arrived in. This is not the seller's fault but my own difficulty in finding this plant easily locally. So if you know how to care for the mogra jasmine and can't find it locally, please order from the seller- doing it in warmer weather has its own challenges. Spring and fall would be good times to order- but be prepared for some nursing care for the plants. The seller sends healthy robust plants but the travel takes its toll."
2,Showerhead wouldn't stay adjusted,"Looks like it probably filters very well, but I couldn't get the showerhead to stay adjusted at various angles after moving if that makes any sense no matter how tight I tightened it down. Tried ordering a replacement and it did the same thing. Will try a different brand."
5,holster,"holds alot, I removed clip that dangles. I do firealarm work and carry...both bit kits for leathermanbit driver with socket adaptersocket set metric n saemaglightbrushmarkerspen screwdriver from wallyworld"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"I bought this because of it's high reviews and I'm really disappointed. One of the receivers never even worked. The one that does work has terrible reception. Overall, it's just a poor product design. It even feels cheap. I wouldn't bother attaching the handle to a strap of any sort because it would probably break. The on and off button for the part with the microphone is on the side rather than on top... so I have to pick it up every time I want to turn it off."
3,Replacable cell phone battery,"At first, I didn't know how to use the cell phone battery when I received it, even though the original battery I have is quickly becoming defective day-by-day. I've had my cell phone for like 2+ yrs. already, and the phone is getting old. Not to mention that I drop it occasionally. But once I asked a friend that the new battery isn't working and she asked me if I've charged it yet after I replaced the old one in the phone and I know that I haven't, I realized my mistake. It's been working fine ever since. I don't have to worry that my phone will have ""power low"" close to the end of the day, even though I charge it every night before going to bed for at least 8 hrs."
4,Hard-to-forget film; give it a chance!,"I am a fan of several of Atom Egoyan's films, and was curious about the milieu of this one. Since seeing it, I find my mind drifting back to it with some consistency; empirically speaking, I know it affected me on some levels that I'm only dimly aware of. I thought Kevin Bacon's take on a character meant to remind us of the older Jerry Lewis was rich and daring; Colin Firth made an indelible impression as his straight man, the repressed but debonair Brit standing in for Dean Martin's suave Italian-American. Alison Lohman seems not quite up to her key role, and I found myself wondering if Egoyan might have had someone more cerebral like Sarah Polley (he cast her so perfectly in The Sweet Hereafter) in mind instead. A classic whodunit dressed up in artsy chronology, you will find yourself changing your mind a few times about what really happened before the final scenes."
3,"It was good, too bad Claire didnt play a better part.","Animation is great, a little stiff here and there and amazing in some other parts. I think Claire could have done better, after all this is THE REUNION between Claire and Leon, the stars of resident evil 2 (video game). Leon looks a little different from re4, yes it does slow down after the airport but the G-virus is here too, along with a monster that is like the birkin monster from re2. Claire says she has a new boyfriend and Leon kisses any other girl but Claire, so i dont think we'll ever see them as couple in the future, too bad. It was good, they should make another one with CHRIS and Jill, now that would be cool. Resident evil fans from the first to the 4th game will enjoy it, the movie had some cool things it lacked some others but its WAY BETTER than the live action movies."
5,Amazing movie for the whole family!,Another wonderful movie from the Kendrick brothers! Well put together and spiritually moving film for the whole family. I would highly recommend seeing it and buying the movie. You won't regret it!!
1,Skip it.,A Very long and boring movie to say the least. It is way too confusing and has enough story for 3 movies. It gets too frantic sometimes and the end was all mess and kept me way too confused. Not enough explaining. Good acting though (which is what saves it) but there is way to much empty space in between.
4,how to use the 25 30 clip,u just take the clip put the end with the hole in it in the hole then push the clip into place and pull back on the lever near the opposite end of the gun and just pop it into place then loafd it up and ur good 2 go
1,Half of order missing,"I was very disappointed when I received my order because it was supposed to be a 3 set DVD Beginners, intermediate, and advanced; well I only received the intermediate DVD. It would be nice if I could get the beginners to start with and also the advanced. The order did arrive in a timely manner, so that was good. This is the first time this happened so it could have been a honest mistake."
4,Good pan for the price...,"This pan just arrived and I've already given it a test run. The non-stick is beautiful and everything slides right off with just the barest hint of olive oil. The main con of the pan is this: if you are used to high end cookware, this pan will seem a little...flimsy. It's really quite lightweight compared to some other brands of hard anodized. On the other hand, the current price of $25 is a steal so one can hardly complain. Just don't order this thinking it has the heft of a Calphalon commercial or even Anolon Advanced--it doesn't, but the price is much, much less. Anyway, cooks beautifully and I'm sure it would have the same life-span as other non-stick (which, for me, is somewhere around two years--I don't baby things)."
5,It's liberals who are mean spirited!!,This is a great book and i'm disappointed that this book has yet to get the press it deserves.This shows the hidden agenda of liberals and their New World Order mentality and it's shocking to say the least.This is a great gift to those on the left who always claim that Conservatives are mean spirited since it details the chronicles of the new thought police!
1,doesn't last!,"I am very disappointed w/my Keurig B60 special ed. brewer. Only used it for a few months and it just stopped working. I've used filtered water, descaled it at 3 mos, and have properly maintained it. I called the company and all they would say was that it couldn't be fixed; no explanation why. It is not under warranty b/c even though it's been in use under a year, I've owned it just over a year. They just offered me a discount on another one. I told them no thanks, that I will never buy Keurig products again, and am going back to the Farberware that I've had for years. On top of all that it's too expensive. A nice luxury, but not economical in the long run w/the K-cups."
4,The Truth Shall Set You Free,You judge a tree by its fruit. This documentary succeeds in letting viewers behold this dark little secret that the Catholic Church hopes you will never find out about: The rotting fruit of their sin-harvest that comes from unspeakably heinous crimes against children that are tolerated by them as being business-as-usual!Love is the desire to do good to others but that is the antithesis of all that the Catholic Church represents as it was portrayed in this documentary and as revealed by fearless journalists all over the world who have courageously accepted the bold challenge to find the truth no matter where it takes them and then tell it like it is.
2,Black history analogy?,LOL! I know nothing about this product but have the Black Panther Party and Malcolm X been resurrected and started writing computer programs now? Is this a coincidence? The package has the exact same cover design as the Spike Lee film!
3,This One Is Just Okay,You get what you pay for. Definitely need to pair this one up with additional bracelets. This one is just okay.
2,Perfect Title,"As the title says ""Nobody's Perfect"". It's just the record company trying to squeeze a few more dollars out of us die hard DP fans. Ian's voice is shot. I've seen the band since this release (without Ritchie) and Ian's voice is better then this album and Steve fills Ritchie's shoes nicely. The rest of the band has still got it. It just goes to prove that grey don't mean dead."
5,"A ""Seth"" novel?","Jane Roberts and Seth may be gone, but it appears that an author has come along to carry the torch for them: Jan Longwell-Smiley! Although the author goes off on her own interesting tangents, this is essentially the Seth material in the form of a fun, intriguing story. It would certainly make Jane and Seth proud! Ms. Smiley gets straight to the point, as she dispells many of the New Age notions that are constantly being puked out by all the so-called metaphysical ""experts."" Her take-no-prisoners approach and attititude are a welcome relief from such books as THE CELESTINE PROPHECY, which only insult our intelligence. If you're tired of all the crap that's being passed off as metaphysical ""wisdom,"" MASTER OF DISASTER is a book that deserves your serious attention."
1,Boring,"If you feel this is a great effort by Tool, I'm jealous. I so wanted to love this album, as I have their past 3...Please attempt to review this CD here, and not the band. Anyone who bothers to post here probably loves Tool, as I do, however 10,000 DAYS has little progression in the songs, and is made up mostly droning riffs that go nowhere. None of the epic sound of past releases.Perhaps the biggest disappointment is the production; maynard's voice is way back in the muddy sound of the guitars, and never wails above when it should. And where are the great searing guitars(?), mainly boring unimaginative riffing.A few high points, but way too many boring minutes - all the ambient filler further makes me suspect of the effort. The silver lining? Tool will tour and we can hear the rest of their catalog...Lateralus was Tool's peak, with Aenima only slightly less brilliant. Now, sadly the curve has started downward... sharply.Bummed. Really bummed."
3,would be better on video tape,"I'm sure these exercises have been proven over the test of time in the New York City Ballet, but I did the exercises once and returned to the gym for a more intense workout. It's too distracting to try to figure out the pictures and flip back and forth from the workout listings. I wouldn't recommend this book if you workout to blow off stress."
5,Unique but Rocks!!!,"If you are a Pantera fan then you have to get this album. This band consists of all the original Pantera members except for the lead singer. The idea of this band was to combine metal and country music. But rest assured, with Dimebag on guitar, this album rocks hard."
3,Complete confusion on this page....,"My rating is completely arbitrary and included only so I can post this remark, for reasons explained below: in short, that this page is hopelessly combining two different works.Okay, there was a 1990 Hong Kong movie with the title ""Xiao ao jiang hu""; the English title was Swordsman; it was based on a Louis Cha novel; it spawned two sequels. There appears to have been a 2000 TV series also called ""Xiao ao jiang hu,"" based on the same novel. If the IMDB is to be trusted, the English title (in Singapore, at least) is ""The Legendary Swordsman."" Okay: Two different adaptations of the same book.The cover picture, price, and date in the title suggest that this is the TV series; but the list of directors and stars suggests that this is the 1990 film. The various comments and reviews are mostly about the 1990 film. Something has gone terribly wrong here."
5,Very sad,Like all of the one last Wish books this one is very sad.This book opened my eyes to what real life is really like and how living can be if you let it a wonderful expercence. I also loved dont die my love by the author.
2,Disappointing Book,"I always loved to hate Arn Anderson but like a train wreck, you couldn't take your eyes off of the man as he was a great performer.My big gripe with the book is that Arn can't break ""kayfabe"" and tell some of the real life, behind the scenes stories of the business. He tells it as if it's all for real and not ""works"". Other books I've read, such as Bret Hart's and Bobby Heenan's first books are much better reads and have the inner workings of the business.Arn's book is a paperback and the pictures were not clear at all.. it almost looked like a second rate Xerox job so the quality overall was ""fair"". If I had to do it over again, I would have passed on buying this book.."
4,review,"Good condition for the book. I wished the book had more pictures and were colored. I also wished the pages were the heavy paper. The service was great, very fast but am disappointed in the book."
3,Just OK,It does the job but isn't anything super. I would prefer neoprene. In the end I purchased a Manhattan Portage bag that has a neoprene sleeve built in. This case works for me when I put it in any other luggage.
4,They taste pretty good,"Pringles Cheezums Potato Crisps just do cut it. They are good on my breath too. Honestly, they taste pretty good. I would get them again."
2,Hamilton Beach Can Opener,"While this can opener is a lot quieter than my last one, it does have a major flaw. It drops the can after opening it. I have wiped up a few spills because of this. I have used it approx 30 times and it held the can 4 of those. Due to this, I am already looking for a new can opener."
2,Its ok but be careful on some of the transitioning,"I got this workout to see if I'd like them before buying their new slim in 30 series. I have done kettle wox, Zumba, P90X, and Brazilian Butt Lift series. I found that it had some good moves but some segments were done so quick it was hard to catch onto what she was doing. I also found that some of the transitioning between weights and non weights was too quick. I actually strained my left back muscles doing this workout and that has never happened with any of the harder programs. I like changing things up and will do this occasionally but not as often as some of my other programs. Just wasn't impressed by it."
1,manufacturing defects,"I bought two of these headphones. Both had serious manufacturing defects.On one, the supplied RCA cord was bad (no sound at all). I replaced this with one from my junk box and all was well.The other had to be returned. (Aside, one reason I buy from Amazon is their excellent return polices). There simply was no sound to the left earpiece.While a population of two, of course, is insufficient to make a lasting judgement, it does seem the factory fails the soldering/crimping test. :)The purpose of these was simply to allow my wife to watch/listen to TV in the middle of the night without awaking me. (one for the small bedroom TV and the other for the monster in the living room). Hence the absence of comments on sound quality.. except to set them up (or try to), I have never had them on."
1,Flimsy,"One of the flimsy plastic hinges was broken when we received this seat and the other broke while taking it out of the box. The only good thing I can say about this seat is that it came with a step stool which we still use. For my second purchase, I decided to go with the ""Family Seat"" made of MDF and am much happier. The material is more durable, the hinges are stronger, and I am going to buy another one for our second bathroom."
5,Just what I wanted!,"This is a great product. Can be used on a table to elevate the back of the keyboard, or on your lap (either flat or folded in half) to keep your legs cooler."
5,Behold The Mysteries Of The Red Planet!,"I can't imagine anyone not showing some kind of fascination with our neighboring planet Mars. Ben Bova creates a fantastic scene which places the reader right there along with the characters. My expectations were that of anything could happen in a strange planet unexplored by humans. There is a possible startling discovery made by Jamie which will keep you reading on and on. I must admit the ending is almost tragic and a bit disappointing, but the entire novel is definitely worthwhile. Bova made sure to leave something to the imagination and to preserve the possible mysteries of the red planet."
4,a little confused,"I was not aware that the costume ties around the waist, and does not have arms or a back, just a cape. Still, it worked well for my little Darth on Halloween."
4,"Great service. Good, solid beef jerky","This beef jerky is good and solid. I use the word solid because it is not moist. The heat also overwhelms the smoke flavor (at least for me). I will definitely consume this, but will buy another flavor next time.I've also tried the original flavor which is very good and moist and the barbecue, which is very moist and absolutely delicious.If you like your jerky chewy with some fire and some smoke flavor, buy this!"
5,Excellent cover,great product for the price. Very heavy. I defintely won't have to worry about the wind blowing this off the grill. Wish they made a smoker cover also.
3,I'll fill you in on this disappointing CD...,"When I first heard the handsome British two-step singer Craig David's first American single ""Fill Me In,"" I loved it. The lyrics were mischievious and the tune was so melodic and catchy. But when I heard ""7 Days,"" an r&b song enhanced by acoustic guitar and story-telling lyrics, I was convinced to buy the album ""Born to Do It."" After giving it a good listen, the only songs I honestly like besides the first two singles are ""Walking Away,"" ""Key to My Heart,"" ""Booty Man,"" ""Fill Me In Part 2,"" and the final (and best) track featuring the Artful Dodger ""Rewind."" I don't know why they call this track two-step because save for the last track, it's pure r&b with an acoustic twist. The subject material gets a little tired, too. Every song is about a rendezvous with a beautiful lady, or sex. It just gets old after awhile. Sorry, but Craig needs to go back into the studio and mix things up a little."
2,Unreadable,"The text tries to do a good job at citing sources, but it unreadable. There is very little content in the text. There are words; not meaning."
3,Read the French Edition of this book.,The only real problem I have with this book was that the American edition has been abridged. Over 150 pages have been cut. As a result much of the portrait of Camus as a philosopher has been deleted. So I would recomend reading the French edition if at all possible
1,Worst flash drive ever,I bought this because of the low price and small form factor - and will be returning it because it is almost unusable. This is possibly even slower than a USB 1 device. It took 5 minutes to copy 20 megs of data. Even doing a full format and defrag on the disk didnt help. AVOID!!!
3,priceless Jack Benny,"The filmmakers rode roughshod over the play, adding dialogue and story elements and eliminating a whole character. The production values don't look that great either, with obvious studio settings. Jack Benny's British accent comes and goes - mostly goes - but he's terrific as the cross-dressing ""aunt"" and the comedy is fine. Fun to spot Richard Haydn, who played the agent in The Sound of Music, here as one of the Oxford undergrads. The DVD also includes a wonderful promotional short with Benny, Tyrone Power and Randolph Scott."
4,"Too short, but decidedly insiteful","some of the things the the charecter of misty said in the story really made sense, & was stuff i could identify with, being a child of divorce. She calls herself an ""orphan with parents"" which comes very close to the truth. i liked the book, but as i said, it was to short. it wasn't styled very much like V.C. Andrews originals, which for one thing were series of novels, in stead of a mini-series of novellas with a longer conclusion. this series didn't have as much mystery, & lacked V.C. Andrews signature ""flashback book"" going back at least a generation to clear up any questions."
2,Nasty,"I bought this popcorn a few months ago off of Amazon and decided to come back here and leave a review to warn people that like cheese popcorn not to buy this. I was a big fan of the Orville Redenbacher Pour Over Cheddar popcorn but since that has been discontinued, I figured I would try this Jolly Time cheese popcorn. Big mistake, it is nothing like the discontinued Redenbacher kind. There is not even a good cheese flavor, it's just horrible. The bad thing is when you buy this you get 36 bags of popcorn, so if you don't like it you're stuck with a ton of bags.If you really want to try this stuff, I would suggest buying a small box from a grocery store to try it first, and then if you like it, come back on here and buy this lot of 36 bags.I give this popcorn 2 stars out of 5 since it's at least edible.....barely."
2,Super annoying,"I have had this DVD on the shelf for a while. I bought it a while back when some friends and I started doing various yoga/pilates videos together regularly. We could hardly get through this workout without pulling our hair out and choking the television set, not to mention rolling around on the floor laughing. Denise Austin does not shut up for one single second. And the stuff she says is completely ridiculous -- very little instructional help but lots of cheesy encouragement and nonsense chatter. Eventually we started muting the TV and playing our own music, but pretty soon it found a nice place on the shelf to gather dust. I can't even remember the workout aspect, except that it was hard for some of us but not for others, but I'll never buy another video from Denise Austin."
1,Masada DVD,Very disappoint DVD version of Masada. Just no extra feature and no subtitle and no closed-caption. Just plain movie with scene selection in menu and nothing else. good thing I rented from Netflix.
2,Was he joking?,"Although this album definitely has some strong tracks, overall it was a big letdown. Cohen somehow goes was overboard into his own style, and it feels like he is doing a parody of himself. While many of his previous albums are very haunting and engaging, this one just leaves me feeling embarrassed for him.Really, I'm shocked to see all these other great reviews."
5,m97xe,"great sounding, inexpensive cartridge for my old tt. replaced an old, old, a t cartridge. minimal investment, big improvement in sound"
4,good stuff,"This dvd is good, but I would have preferred a few more songs. The performance of the band is good, but the audience was too small , and did not seem to be exceptionallly energetic.To the reviewers in Barbados, this is not Jazz, so dont expect to hear trumpets like those from heaven. This is reggae, so the horn men will only come on periodically.Thats enough.Any true steel pulse fan should have this dvd. It should be more energetic, but it has good clean audio, and video.Good reggae music from a legendary band. They dont make them any more, so get this dvd."
4,Very Good!,This was the first romance book I read and I was hooked at the start. The storyline has so many twists and turns that you never know what will happen next. I was surprised that this type of book was so entertaining but I couldn't put it down!
4,Decent,"I'm a huge Dr Who fan, and David Tennant is my hero. That said:This is the full size toy. Same size as in the movie. Some of the other ones on the net are the tiny 3"" long basically keychain trinkets.It has ok sound for a toy replicating a movie, but it's not quite as cool as the movie sound. Still kinda coolThis is of course made of cheap plastic, but the best you're going to get at this price. What were you expecting, metal? If you were going to use it as a prop when going to a sci-fi convention, I would dirty it up some to make it look aged and rugged, instead of shiny plastic. Maybe use some dye or paint effects on the nooks and crannies on the handle?The UV ink is invisible, and the light does illuminate it perfectly. Cool for kids I guess."
4,Reading Rack for Treadmill,"This reading rack not only fits my older-model treadmill, but allows me to read while I'm using the treadmill. The only reason why I didn't give this product 5 stars is because it interferes a little with the controls on the treadmill. Other than that, it works just fine. I highly recommend it."
1,drill didn't work,Had high hopes for this - gave it as a Christmas gift and the drill didn't work. Now I have to return.
3,Not too helpful for small groups.,"We are a small congregation. Most of this book seemed to be directed at a larger group. To set up the organization they suggest, we would need every member serving on four or five committeess, yet they suggest no one shouild do more than one or two. I had trouble seeing how to apply their ideas to our situation. A larger congregation, with a liking for lots of committee work would likely find this book more helpful."
1,Black & Decker Garment Steamer,This was a pretty pitiful attempt at a garment steamer. Very little steam was produced [meaning the shirt being 'steamed' didn't have a prayer of losing its wrinkles] and I'm returning the item which was a Christmas gift to my son-in-law.
2,The title is somewhat misleading.,"This is maybe a 4 Star book - IF, and ONLY if, this is the first book on Jack Welch and GE you have picked up. If you have already read ""Jack"" skip it. There is nothing here that hasn't already been said elsewhere. I was disappointed how little ""new"" information was presented in this book.If you are looking for something on the topic of controlling your own destiny this title is somewhat misleading."
3,Not as good as I was expecting but tolerable...,"I've heard a great deal of hype about PD James, but I was disappointed in this one. The details are a little muddled, there is a strange and unexplained transition in the inspector's investigation towards the end of the book, and the writing itself is not engaging. Agatha Christie at her weakest is better than this. Still, it's somewhat of a page-turner and I will be reading another PD James book soon just to give her another chance. James has the right idea with this plot but just doesn't carry it off somehow."
4,Great fathers day gift,I got this for my dad for Father's day. It was the perfect gift. He absolutely loved it. Not to mention Amazon's price was great!
1,Save yourself the heartache of lost or inacessible data,"I think that imation 2HD IBM diskettes are the WORST storage devices on the planet! A couple of other schoolmates and I were attracted by these colorful diskettes and we have come to realize that they are not durable. If you want to protect the integrity of your term papers and projects or have access to them, please do not use preformatted imation 2HD IBM diskettes, as you will be very disappointed. Moreover, you know what? Their customer support is so unprofessional ...I called them about the diskettes and they were rude. Oh! I am so upset that they position themselves as the best and actually have such terrible equipment out there...I hope that students will stop wasting their money on these diskettes.Disappointed end user"
5,A MASTERPIECE!!,"I would like to congratulate Mr McGorman for writing such an amazing book about the Foreign Legion. Since I am thinking about joining the Legion somewhere down the line , I tried to gather as much information as possible. So far I have never read a book which was so moving and truthful coming from an ex legionnare before. I emailed him and thanked him for telling the Legion for what it really is. He was kind enough to reply and answer few of my questions. I would recommend this book to anyone who is even slightly considering to join the Legion."
2,Overrated,"I found this movie to be quite overrated. This was yet another movie billed as a comedy but that produced very few laughs. The thin plot grew tiresome quickly. The best part of the movie is the sing-along and the music. It's not that it's a ""bad"" movie, it's just not immensely entertaining. I'd buy the soundtrack before I bought the movie. It's odd because Julia Roberts typically makes much better choices. Go with Mystic Pizza, Runaway Bride, or Notting Hill instead."
3,It really didn't taste all that great. It ...,"It really didn't taste all that great. It was best when it was ice cold, but I really didn't enjoy drinking this at all and probably wouldn't buy it again."
1,1000 points of idiocy,"Peggy Noonan hasn't ever recovered from her prediction that Bill Clinton would lose in 1996. The resentments that have clearly built up in her since then have resulted in this condescending, unbalanced, unintentionally-hilarious and ineptly-written diatribe against his wife. However, it could serve as the basis for a satiric monologue about a bitter and irrelevant woman jealous of another woman's success."
2,THE ACERBIC RABBI STRIKES THE UK,"I've been a fan of former Rabbi Jackie Mason since I was a kid. Admittedly, he's not for everyone. His acerbic, irreverent and decidedly politically incorrect humor still provokes in JACKIE MASON: A NIGHT AT THE OPERA (Kulture). His one man show at London's elegant, prestigious Royal Opera House is a perfectly ironic setting for his caustic observations on everything from elderly Jews, George Bush, Tony Blair, the French and much more. Get a front row seat to be offended with the truth. It only hurts if you don't laugh.Not as funny as some of Mason's other performances (see ""The World Accoding To Me""), but he's loose and relaxed and seems to be having a good time with his audience of sometimes bewildered (?) Brits and laughing fellow Jews. (Through no fault of his own, Mason's previously recorded comments about Ararfat seemed oddly out of place when I saw this DVD on the day of Arafat's chaotic funeral.)"
3,Not bad,"This unit had very good reviews and following those I purchased the it. It works very well and the only problem I had was with the floating wick. This shuts the console off when the water reaches a low limit not to burn the motor out. Well, not being an expert on these, the plastic wick had a gradual bend and I had to heat and bend it straight. I had to contact customer service and they were very helpful and sent me pics to see how the wick system was supposed to look. On that I am happy with the performance of the system and recommend it. Its quite and dont need to fill so often. The anti-bacterial treatment is not needed and good old scrubbing will clean this well.Tony"
3,not one of Grisham's best,It took me awhile to get into this one. However I did manage to get hooked into the story and enjoying it. I just don't think it is one of his best works.
5,Way better then the Movie!,"This book is great! I saw the movie before I read the book. The movie is amazing (if you haven't seen it) and the book is even more amazing. I couldn't put it down. You receive so much more of the story through the book and you understand so much more of Howl and Sophie. Read this book if you love the movie. Again, great book."
5,THE BEST EVER,"This is by far the most valuable book I own!""The Common Sense"" is a set of incremental writing notions that can lead ANY writer toward mastery of the essay. It harnesses the innate power of language and the fundamental shape of one's attention rather than relying of prescriptives. Throughout the U.S., composition teachers in classrooms use this as their text book--the only one they need. A syllabus is in the back of the book. The Teacher accompaniment to this book is ""Beat Not the Poor Desk""--the second most valuable book I own."
2,"faces, forms & illusions","I'm a big fan of Delerium but not this CD. I felt that the group has lost its 'New Age' way with this project. To be more polite, they have gone in a totally different direction. The music, in my opinion, lacks melody & harmony, and lacks the ambient sounds so typical in their earlier efforts. My favorite Delerium are Karma, Poem, Chimera. Sorry to offend the raters who are obviously more inspired. I'll keep playing it; maybe something on the CD will eventually catch my interest."
5,Nice surprise from BBB,Bad Boys Blue made this album pretty well. All songs are in Bad Boys Blue style - greate dance melodies and love lyrics.
4,Best Bang for Your Buck,"Probably the best and most concise collection of Def Leppard's work you could ask for. All their dumb fun metal numbers you know and love are here, including my faves ""Animal"", ""Photograph"", ""Love Bites"", and ""Bringin' on the Heartbreak"". That said, a few tracks aren't quite musical enough to keep you from noticing the rather lame lyrics - I'm thinking ""Armageddon It"" (yuk yuk), ""Let's Get Rocked"" (they claim ""it was supposed to be funny""), and ""When Love and Hate Collide"", which sounds unnervingly like Bryan Adams (I *knew* John ""Mutt"" Lange shouldn't've worked with him!). I also haven't quite gotten over my high school friend playing ""Pour Some Sugar on Me"" in the car EVERY DAY, but hey, that's personal baggage, not critique. Put it on and have some dumb fun!"
2,Very tricky,"I don't know about anyone else, but I can't ever find perfectly round tortillas. And I certainly can't find them perfectly round and the exact diameter of this quesadilla maker. But if your tortillas are very far off the mark, you're looking at an ungodly mess. Cheese, oil, or salsa is going to be coming out the edges of your quesadilla. If the tortilla is a bit short, the mess is inside the machine. If the tortilla is a bit too large, it's all over the counter and the outside of the machine. If you have to do tortilla surgery in order to get the dang quesadilla made, you might as well just make it in a skillet on your stovetop. I can guarantee you that a skillet is going to be way easier to clean than this machine."
3,Good Online Store,Good Items Just Needs Some Work On The Details/Description Overall I Recommend Using The Site/App For Your Next Purchase You Might Save Time And Money
5,Incredibly moving in a subtle way. Read it.,"Why this gem has not received the recognition it deserves in the publishing world is impossible to understand. Now available in America; finally. An important testament to the Houlocaust, and, in a larger sense, to humanity... to hope... Sweet & terrible; austere, beautiful, humbling. You will want all of the people you love to read it, too..."
4,Excellent,"Rebecca Forster is an amazing storyteller. Hostile Witness has it all, characters you'll love and bad guys you'll love to hate. A real page turner."
5,Amazing,"I'm buying these tunes again on an audio cd. The first time I bought in the90's on a cassette. Needless to say I wore it out! I played that tape to death,and remember loving those songs, so after a long separation, I'm buyingthem again so I can listen to them again and again. I can't praise thisset enough, great guitars, vocals, just fantastic rock and roll old style.Def. one of the best albums/cd ever made."
1,the worst album I've ever heard,"I heard the album at a friend's house. thank god i didn't buy this thing. the album lacks a sound and the instruments aren't as powerful as some critics say. The worst feature is the vocalist who seems to be mocking high pitched singers and if that's his best attempt in singing I rather hear a dog bark. their recent single is quite annoying to hear on the radio, this album is full of chaos without organization and therefore it has no harmony...in my opinion. My advice is hear the whole album and think twice about buying something like this... I recommend Duran Duran's ""Medazzaland"" which I think has a lot of arranged melodies and it's sound is rawer than this album."
1,I'll tell you what's not to love...,"Whine, whine, whine, snivel, snivel, snivel. Never have I read such a dreadfully forced attempt at humor, self-loathing and oh-gosh-look-down-at-my-shoes false modesty. This was the, and I mean, THE most annoying book I have read in ages. And I am not surprised in the least that it tanked. Mr. Ames just doesn't have the confidence to carry the wit. He lumbers along, clomp, clomp, clomp, dreaming of a beautiful woman beside him and ending up with some guy in a wig, again and again. I doubt he'll have any more books published."
3,WWE Wreckless Intent,"This album isn't that bad. I use to like it alot better when they contained entrance music that you are accustomed to hearing, rather than ones that are going to be played after the album's release. When the old WWE ""The Music"" albums came out, the majority of the songs on there were ones that you could listen to and immediately idenfity who's music it was. I don't like the idea of having to read the back of the cover to see what I'm listening to. I'm just old school I guess..."
4,One of his best,An excellent book with appealing characters that change over time. A good fast paced plot.
2,SLOW RESPONSE,"THE MOST FRUSTRATING ITEM ON THIS CAMERA IS THE SLOW RESPONSE TO TAKE THE PICTURE. PUSH THE BOTTOM, AND WAIT A SECOND OR MORE BEFORE IT RESPONDS . . . MOST OF THE TIME MISSING THE SHOT YOU WANTED TO GET."
3,Clearly pronounced words? I don't think so!,"Dora is cute, and my three-year-old daughter loves her. However, I can't understand what she's saying most of the time, and my daughter, who has a mild hearing loss, can't either. I wish there were a volume control or something. As it is, my daughter cannot really use it as intended."
5,One of his best...,"The song ""Have a little faith"" is so inspiring to me and it means holding on and keep kicking."
1,Book of the Long wind,Wolfe has significantly lost his form in this series compared with the Book of the New Sun. He's trying for the same sense of phantasmagoria but fails. You can see him trying too hard. The world is unconvincing - I tried to suspend belief and just go with the flow but it was just too slow.
3,Worth Reading for Devine's and Johnson's alone,"I bought this book for Schone's story, but ended up liking the other 3 better. Schone's story was okay, it was just very repetitious. I felt like I was reading the exact same story from The Lady's Tutor and her last anthology, just change the names of the characters and give the hero a different sexual problem. Speaking of which, why does she think a man has to be sexually abused by other men (gross) or sexually mutilated to be a deep hero? Again, the same old scenario rehashed. Plus I'm 25, so the hero and heroine are older than my parents! (53 and 48) (I'm sorry to keep going on and on, but I had high expectations for this book! I was hoping it would be an improvement on The Lover.)The good news is that Devine and Johnson just keep getting better and better. Devine's story was so hot that words fail me! I'd buy this book for the middle 2 stories alone."
2,Too Small,This litter box was too small for my cats. The sides weren't high enough. Would be good for small cat that doesn't dig a lot.
4,Prior edition,"The third edition of this textbook is a definitive work on the art and science of nuts and bolts clinical electrophysiology. To practice competent invasive EP you need to understand pretty much everything written here, as a starting point.I don't own the latest edition but have perused it several times at meetings. I don't think it compares to other books available that cover 3D anatomical mapping and newer technologies better. If you are an EP fellow, I would recommend getting an inexpensive 3rd edition of this book and look elsewhere for the more current technology. You don't want to end up being able to do AF ablations and not understand how to diagnose an antidromic AVRT."
4,State of fear,"Very eye opening and makes one think. Read the book with an open mind. When finished, take action if care about our planet...please!"
4,"Great for plasma / LCD, nor fot CRT.","First off, I'd like to address the first moronic reviewer. Just because you are uninformed about the product, doesn't mean it should take away from its review. Next time get a clue and do your homework.That being said, this is a great player. A little pricey, but still great. It works a lot better with a LCD or Plasma though. With my 34"" Sony CRT it works great at 720p, but I noticed a little bit of flicker on 1080i.If you got the extra bucks, go for it. But personally I would wait for the next generation of Bray or HD-DVD players or discs. A dvd MASTERED in HD will be far superior to just an upconversion."
2,Disapointing,"Oster is one of my favorite kitchen appliances brands, but unfortunately this mixer is below average. Key for any mixer is its speed control, and this one hardly seems to have any. It almost starts at full speed, which implies that more liquid mixtures end up all over the place except your mixing bowl. Conclusion: I do not recommend the purchase of this product."
2,poor,"Delkin DD/ENEL5 Rechargeable Battery Equivalent to Nikon EN-EL5This battery is pictured in what seems to be a case.No case or protective cover for the terminals.when you carry a spare battery on a trek a protective cover is nice to have.This has the least mAh of all the batteries I have, 860mAh.I have 2 @ 1500mAh & the one that came with the camera @ 11mAh"
3,Overexposure is Killer,"Smooth is a nice salsa-rock song. Put Your Lights On is a good rap-blues song. Maria Maria is a beautiful R&B song. The Dave Matthews Band does whatever they do on this CD.Put together, this album doesn't make much sense. It's like a movie soundtrack to an over-budgeted over-exposed movie. Oh wait, it is an over-exposed media-hyped CD. Yes, Santana is good, yes, he deserves credit for being a great guitar player. This album doesn't deserve to be his masterpiece, though. Still, his guitar can't make a song go completely south, even if his intentions should have made the album go south."
5,Great book,This is a great synopsis of world religions. Widely accepted by many educated as one of the finest works of its kind.
5,A great gift for thriller readers,"I got this book for my girlfriend and she could not put the book down, everyday she was reading that book sometimes until 2 in the morning. excellent book"
5,Cheap and handy,Inexpensive bath toy holder is great. It's cheap but does the job. Nothing fancy but holds more than I expected.
3,"See it for the battle scenes, not the rest of the storyline.","It's a great represenation of what happened 60 years ago. The only ting I take issue with is the where of all the young men in the film are being so goofy, unconfident with women and clumsy in the first half for the sake of humour. It's a bit overdone.The acting other wise is well done, but Dan akroyd seems out of place, and Jon Voight's FDR make-up looks obvious in some shots. He could have pulled it off without it."
4,"Good content, spelling errors, omission","I enjoyed reading this book until the point that my grandfather was evacuated from the unit. There were spelling errors that could have been corrected. My grandfather was cited as having received a Bronze Star in the text but he was not in the list of members of the unit who received Bronze Stars. An index would have been useful, but the book is searchable on Google Books, solving the problem of not having an index as far as I could tell."
2,One note on the Production,"Looks great on paper,but just a few hits. I love seeing Aesop and Del together especially. However, I don't know if its just me, but I am getting tired of the same old soul samples being all ""chipmunked"". You will definatly find a lot of that on here. Seems like that track with MF Doom coulda been good, but his lazy quirky rhymes don't go with the chipmunked ""ohhhh ohhh oh"" and the violins in the back. The high pitched repetiveness gets on my nerves more than it makes me bob my head. Like others have said, had a lot more potential. Maybe its my taste, but this ""chipmunk beat"" trend going on is killing me."
2,Room in Rome,I know naked two women in room. I found nudity really. I know two women without clothing. I know naked lesbian. I know a man look naked woman on the hall near the room.
5,Remembering,"I Love this movie,the kindness shown to her by the white soldier was very special.the care and love she gave the young boy and raised him as her son was very heartfelt,I just wish they had showed those years of them growing up.Miss Jane reminds me so much of my grandmother (MAMA)who raised me and my three older sister's from birth,being born in Miss.back in the early 50's and 60's if you were'nt married and you have children out of wedlock your kin had to raise them,for most of my young life as far as I knew she was my mother til I was fixing to graduate from 8th grade did I find out that she was my grandmother mother of my mother,but it really did'nt matter.she was and is my Heart,that's what this movie reminds me of,our relationship we had a very close bond and always will,that's why this movie is so special to me. REMEMBERING MAMA"
3,Not her best yet,"First than anything, I gotta say I am a Thalia fan since her album debut ""Arrasando"". Now, this new album, ""El Sexto Sentido"" is a very good comeback after her crappy English album release. However, for some reason, this new album, im my opinion, doesnt reflect her best. I consider her albums Arrasando & Thalia (spanish one) way better than this new release. Amar sin ser amada, Loca & Alma Sentenciada are my favorite songs on this cd. The rest of the songs, at leats for now, after having listened to it at least 50 times, doesnt make it for me. They all sound boring and some of them even silly. The music and her vocals are very good thou. If you dont have any Thalia album yet Id recommend you her cd Thalia (spanish) over this one. I think she could do way better than this. Time will tell us."
1,"Wireless consistently drops, slow internet (for cable)","This is the second one of these I've had the (dis)pleasure of working with. Fortunately I only bought the first one...1) Wireless stops working 1-2 times a week. Sometimes power cycling works, sometimes resetting from scratch works. Sometimes neither works. However it might be overheating... I just put it in the freezer since I noticed it was warm and its back working... When you ping the router when it starts misbehaving it times out or gets responses like 768ms. Plugging directly into the router when it acts like this works, but what's the point?2) Internet access is consistently slower than everywhere else and we have cable.I have installed the latest BIOS update for this thing. My roomates get feisty when they cant get on the internet and I am an IT professional.. hehehe. They are starting to doubt my skills!At this rate Im thinking of going back to dialup. I got a spare 1200 baud modem floating around here..."
1,shuts off automatically after 5 seconds and I cant get it to say on!,"initially I liked this little pocket radio, but after 6 month it started to turn off with in 5 seconds after I turned it on and there is no way I can figure out how to get it to stay on and play my station. I would give it back in a hot second if I still could. now I'm not sure if this is just a fluke with the specific radio that I got or is it an indication that this might be a wider problem with this specific model."
2,Did not light up!,"I purchased this as a gift for my younger brother for Christmas. He opened it and was wildly excited because he's been wanting one for awhile. We were much dismayed then when we put the batteries in and the light did not work. We were able to determine, using some electrical equipment his grandfather had, that it was the lightbulb that was defective not the whole piece. However, we've now gone to three stores and have been unable to locate the correct bulb. We are trying one more store before returning the product. VERY inconvenient for something that should have worked from the start."
1,Such a waste...,"Living proof of how working in publishing can help your more-than-mediocre book get on a bestseller list. Horribly self-indulgent. And if I had to read one more quasi-humorous entertainment industry reference or another gem about author's obsessive-compulsive disorder...Read Encyclopaedia Britannica instead. It will surely be more interesting, far less irritating, and I bet it will not have inexcusable, distracting spelling errors on each page."
5,A good first novel,"This is Karin Kallmaker's first published novel and for a first, it's very good. All the humor and sincerity that will become the most enjoyable features of all of her romance books abound in this early effort. The plot is solid, the characters the kind of women who could live next door. It's set in 1978, in the year when the gay rights movement was galvanized by the murder of San Francisco's Harvey Milk. Both women are coming out during this difficult time and I liked the historical context of what coming out then was like ... it was a different world and the times were riskier. So much has changed, and so much hasn't.This early effort lacks the richness of language that flowers later in Kallmaker's work. But the story spins out quickly and gathers the reader closely. Her fans won't want to miss it. Compare it to her Unforgettable and see how good she already was, and then how much her talent has grown."
3,Disaster MissFired,"This is one of those movies that works much better on the small screen.It has a great cast, some memorable performances and some state-of-the-art Special Effects, however, the story is a little week and even sappy in some points.In the theatre it kind of bored me, but the DVD is much better. Not many extras but it does have the Aerosmith music video for the film on it.This is a better film to watch in the living room with your family and should have passed the big screen. Disaster missed this mark!"
1,you can do better,"This was given to my daughter as a gift. I am not a fan...The music only plays for a *very* short time...like 30 seconds. This is not long enough for me to leave the room let alone a child to fall asleep. The music is very annoying...I can't stand it. It plays notes of twinkle twinkle etc, but the sound quality is terrible. I don't know how to describe it, but I would not find it soothing. Also no way to turn off once it is playing, just have to let it run it's course.I much prefer the Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Soothe and Glow Seahorse. We have had this for almost 3 years. It is still going strong and we love it. The music is soothing, not annoying. It plays for ~5 minutes, not 30 seconds and has an added feature of being able to turn off if you want. Choose this one instead, you won't be disappointed."
3,"Very nice, but very, very tight.","Pros:Construction quality is very good! The glove feels nice, looks good, and the stitches are even. They look like they will last well for just about any use.Cons:Using the tape measure around the hand sizing method, I come in at about 21.5 cm. According to the chart this is between small and medium sized hands. These medium gloves are far too tight for me. I believe the chart is off and should be updated.Note:I would give 3.5 stars if half stars were available. Overall these could be a 4.5 but since they are so tight (they started to cut off the circulation in my hand), they need to be docked that point.Update to review 11/2011:I bought the Large size, and it is ALSO very tight! It does fit, but if I try to open my thumb too far I fear I will tear the glove. I suggest buying your gloves in a store."
5,I love it,I love this tape because it is very authentic the instructor takes thing slow so you can understand the exercises. I also bought 2 more to give as gifts.
4,A little bit of fun for the very young set,"This was a gift for my 2 year old grandson. He finds it almost too easy, so I would suggest giving it to even younger children. It is good for interactive visual reading activity."
2,Niel young le noise blue day,Very very disappointing. Not at what we paid to see on cables pay preview. Not happy & not at all what we expected to get
3,good movie..poor quality,"I saw this movie a few years ago...and it is still one of my absolute favourites. Sean Connery and Lambert does a great performance. I started thinking i was watching a documentary of immortals or something...almost hiding behind the couch in order to not get my head cut off. The atmosphere of the movie is encredible. The only bad thing is the sound(horrible)...its better than vhs but not much.The people behind this dvd really messed the thransfer up. If u are a big fan of highlander then you will probably buy this anyway,but for the rest of us its not worth it. It contains the worst got damn sound Ive ever heard in a dvd. Rent the movie or record it from cable instead,dont buy this."
2,Least Favorite of Books on Statue of Liberty,"I just read through a large stack of books on the Statue of Liberty with my children (ages 2-9). This was my least favorite. The children in the story complain and whine, are disrespectful, and rude. I skipped over a number of words as I read this story. The information on the Statue of Liberty is minimal compared to many of the other enjoyable story books that we read. A few of the books we enjoyed more includeLiberty!,Emma's Poem: The Voice of the Statue of Liberty (Jane Addams Award Book (Awards)),Annushka's Voyage (A Play),You Wouldnt Want to Be a Worker on the Statue of Liberty!: A Monument Youd Rather Not Build, andThe Statue of Liberty (Step Into Reading: Step 2)."
1,the nightstalker movie review,"THIS WAS ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES ON A SERIAL KILLER THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN. THE ONLY TRUE FACT ABOUT THIS MOVIE WAS THAT HE WAS A DRUG USER. WHY IS IT THAT PEOPLE TRY TO MAKE AN ART-SY STATEMENT, INSTEAD OF TELLING A TRUE STORY ABOUT SOME ONE LIKE THIS. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND RENT THE MADE-FOR-TV-MOVIE ""MANHUNT""."
2,This toys needs a manners lesson!,"The durability is fine, it moves on grass well and the mowing sound is cute...BUT the faces can be a little scary for younger or more timid children. The MOST IMPORTANT part...the phrases this mower has and the fact that it burps...it is just rude and unecessary! These are things I want to teach my children not to do. We returned it and purchased the Little Tykes mower for now and we are considering a John Deer."
3,Wider blades are generally more useful,"I ordered these because they were on a special, but the wider (1-3/4"") blades are generally more useful."
5,The one Punk album you need to own,"This is the one punk album you need to own if you care about any pop/rock music produced in the last 2 decades. The Sex Pistols couldn't hold a candle to these four Londoners who wielded their instruments like weapons and called for revolution.True, the mood doesn't change much on this album. Anger, defiance. From anger at the U.S.A., to anger at the New Wave, to anger at unemployment, to anger at prejudice. One song's even titled ""Hate and War"". Only one weak track here - the cover of ""I Fought the Law"". This is the Clash's brilliant debut and second best album, only because London Calling is the best rock album produced since Pet Sounds.And why is it the best punk album ever? Because it has great hooks, great lyrics, speed, and energy."
3,well.......,"This series is for serious anime fans, and people capable of deep thought... i mean deep thought.. ( unlike myself ) This series has similar ideas and thoughts similar to that of the last episode of evangelion. If you did not like the last episode of eva, then you might not like this series. The animation is superb, but the story line is not appealing to everyone, watching it a few times might help also.. overall.. not bad.. but not that great either.."
1,Does NOT live up to its hype,"I had heard a lot of really good things about this movie. Several different people all recommended it to me: ""It involves math and science fiction; you'll like it."", ""It's off-beat and weird; you'll like it."", and ""It's unique and makes you think; you'll enjoy it.""Nope, can't say that I did. It dragged in the story. It didn't make much sense at any point. I barely found the characters interesting. And the ending was a relief that I no longer had to watch the drudgery of a film rather than the satisfaction of an entertaining movie.Maybe I just missed the point of the film. Maybe it really was entertaining. But I would rather slide down a razor blade into a pool of iodine than watch this a second time."
5,Wonderful,I bought these to go with Dragon Software and they work wonderfully I would recommend them highly. Easy to use.
5,Gone Too Sonn,"I bought this book for a friend who had a stillborn baby. I also had a stillborn baby several years and ago and it was very helpful and comforting to me, I knew it would be the perfect gift for her. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has lost a baby."
5,Fast and Easy,Amazon is faster that going to the store to buy this item. I would have to make a special trip and drive 22 miles each way.
5,Best of Louis Jordan,"A must have! Especially for the track Saturday Night Fish Fry. Evey song is great, just LOVE that Louey Jordan."
5,A Brilliant Live DVD,"Performing songs from The Fourth Legacy, Karma, Epica and The Black Halo, this is a the best way to see Kamelot on a screen to date."
4,A Movie,"I like the movie. This is what I call a movie when it is is not what you expect. The storyline is not traditional but new in concept. Also, I like the actors John Cusack and Samuel Jackson/"
3,More Game Functionality,The Jedi additions are outstanding. Better game feel and play but the flying can be challenging. Not sure if I am not yet used to it but it is taking some time getting used to it to be able to fly and understand how to avoid death.
3,Different,I was told about this book from a cab driver in Jamaica. I bought it thinking it was nonfiction. It is based on fact but it is not nonfiction. It does give an incite on what really went on in Jamaica. That was a real eye opener. I wouldn't recommend friends to buy it but would offer to let them read it.
2,"Been there, played that.","I performed Scene 8 from ""Betrayal"" in a theater class, and read the rest of the play in order to form a character analysis of Emma. I found the play intersting, but slightly odd. Some of the wording made no sense, and there were times when the references seemed out of place and just in there for laughs. The play itself was an old idea broadcast in a new way-backwards. It left me feeling bittersweet as I saw how it ended, and then saw how sweetly it started. I recommend the play for its difference in story telling, but I'm not so thrilled with it that I would insist you see a showing. It really seems to come down to the tastes of the person. This one wasn't really my taste."
3,Kinda weak but some fun,"The Williams collection is way better. I have Pinball Dreams & Pinball Fantasies for the SNES & even they seem better with only 4 games a piece.Some of the tables are just to old & have too many holes where you can't save the ball (I'm not a nudger) to really be fun. It is an interesting historical perspective but fun is the name of the game for me.Black Hole and a couple others make it a decent purchase AFTER you get the Williams collection and maybe even those SNES games I mentioned. If you enjoy video-pinball, I think it's worth the price.Others have mentioned the specific titles & options on the game so I'll leave it at that.Oh & Play-Boy & Xolten are not really pinball games but if you want them the codes are below:Play-Bot - PKRXolten - XTNCustom Balls = BLZ"
4,A Real Gem,"I was quite surprised by this lathe. Minor assembly was easy and straightforward, and center to center alignment was dead-on right out of the box. The ""soft start"" motor caused a little consternation when it didn't spin right away when I turned it on, but this is a really nice feature. Shaft play and runout are nearly non-existent, and the live center provided is more than acceptable. The variable speed control gives an adequate range of speeds for roughing, sanding and finishing.I have used this lathe to turn many pens (the purpose for which I bought it) and it has exceeded my expectations. I have also done some small amount of face turning, and was well-pleased with the results. My only complaints are these: A little more power would not go unappreciated for face-turning; and the tailstock spindle grub screw tends to loosen up over time allowing the spindle just a little too much play.For the price, an excellent lathe for pen and spindle turning; underpowered for larger face turning."
2,Ordinary and dull,"Just a simple story , plus parents willing to see the best of everything in their children are shown exactly as 'monsters', rather than adults who could normally make mistakes as expected from human-beings. Also the teacher who acts in unusual ways is shown as a ''hero''. Simply the good versus the bad ! I do not condone pressure or do not blame 'different' types, however this movie is just ''the war between the extremists''."
5,Christmas is here again,"One of a very few Christmas movies that explains to kids what is the reason for Christmas, Chirstmas is for the birth of Jesus"
3,A good book on Sufism,"This was one of the earliest books on Sufism in the Persian language. It is unique in that it was written very early in Islam, disputing the fact that Sufism was ""introduced"" later into Islam. When I first read Nicholson's translation, it was heavy reading, but was worth the while as I was curious about Sufism. So I did enjoy this book, especially because it managed to clarify some particularly detailed aspects of Sufism. However, I *have* subsequently seen a better and more contemporary translation of this book by a practicing Sufi, infact (Maulana Wahid Bakhsh Rabbani). It is much easier reading if you can find a copy."
1,Terrible toy,"What a waste of money. The tracks won't stay together, and even if you can get them to stay together, the toy is too dangerous to use as the cars come flying off in all directions at high speed. Apparently there was a supplemental safety net added to the toy, but I never saw one in our box."
1,I'll let ya know,I guess its unfair to review this movie as I havent made it past the first five minutes. I will keep trying when I have some time to waste...of course I wil probably need some help staying awake
5,best dance single of the year 99,"the rhythm of the song take me in to the dance mood each time, even in early morning, and if i'm in the car i start to increase the speed about 2 tms."
2,RETURNED!,"First, let me say that I was very pleased with the look of this unit. It ""looks"" like REAL quality when you remove it from the box. That's about where the pleasure ends though. The radio stations don't program well (oodles of static). The sound quality was really bad and I initially planned to buy external speakers until it stopped working. Yep, I bought this unit as a Christmas gift and in 3 days, the recipient told me she walked over to the unit to hit stop on the playing CD and everything went black. She tells me that the carpet probably caused a charge that killed the unit but she wasn't sure. I sent the Crosley back to Amazon with my CD still held hostage. I was very pleased with Amazon though, they gave me a FULL refund, shipping and return charges included. I would buy OTHER brands from Amazon again."
5,Compact and easy to carry,The mirror folds in half and has a magnified glass on one half and a regular glass on the other. It folds up so that both glasses are covered and protected. It comes in a small case that protects the outside. It is very convenient for those who like to carry smaller bags or purses.
3,Quality,I demand Made in America products if I can get them. The plastic reel is poorly made and was a bad idea I could cast some plastic and have a better piece than reel craft made. Reel craft is maximizing profit and sacrificing quality. Spend the extra money and get the metal reel.
2,The title does not match the story.,I thought the book repeated itself many times with the same stories or examples. It was too much detail about things not related to the title of the book.I was going to buy copies for others to read after reading the review but would not do it now since I didn't enjoy the book very much.
4,thick,"No frills, but it's thick and spongy with a smooth top like I wanted. It's large enough that I can hang it half an inch over the desk and it works as a wrist pad. (I have an elevated desk.)"
3,It's fine. Nothing special...just fine.,"It's smaller than I was expecting. It does have lots of pockets and compartments, but it turns out it's kind of annoying to have to open a thousand doors to get to what you want. Don't get me wrong, the product is of fine quality and is as advertised. I guess I would say it's more of an ""over-engineered"" solution. I've got a Carter's diaper bag I carry around every day...one big opening in the middle, a couple of pockets on the sides, one waterproof compartment to keep dirty clothes, etc. Exactly what I need, easy to access everything. I think I got caught up in the ""new mom"" thing when I was still pregnant of trying to find THE perfect, innovative, new, interesting, unusual baby item. You don't really need a lot of bells and whistles. Keep it simple and you'll save yourself a lot of time and money."
2,"Junior, not Buddy","This is basically a Junior Wells album featuring Buddy Guy. Buddy gets to sing on 2 0 3 tracks, and the guitar playing is not as intense. Get the A man and the blues instead"
3,Genuine product ?,"Although may slightly differ from its original lable when intoduced in 1994, you can rest assure that this is a truly authentic product, and not some, ""KNOCK OFF"", as some reveiwers claim, they obviously either dislike the scent overall, or have never compared it to the original scent, because if they did they would not find any difference between the two, and as far as the labeling, reading ""VERSUS"" well for those who know anything about (versace) the parfume industry, knows VS. is versace, and versace is VS., and as for the rating for the overall product i gave, since when have you seen an outstading cologne sold for only $15.00, however, this stuff does has a decent smell when not overly broadcasted, and does not linger around making you nauseated. HENCE, if anyone still has their suspicions about the ""VERSUS"" line, and wish to confirm what i stated, you can look up ""VERSACE"" on wikipedia, and it will tell you exactly who they are !!!"
4,Pretty good text for Space Environment Interactions,"I wouldn't call this text amazing, but it is certainly adequate. I used this book for a graduate level course in space environment interactions mostly because there was a lack of other resources available. This book gives a decent overview, without getting too bogged down with the physics involved. However, the professor had to pull a large chunk of his material from other sources (out of print sources) because Tribble is a little to basic. As an aerospace engineer, I don't care so much about the EE stuff, so Tribble does a good job summarizing the EE physics. Overall, a sufficient reference that gives a good overview of s/c-environment interactions."
1,"Cheap quality, to the point of insulting.","This was my first Amazon purchase of a Blackjack dealing shoe, and boy was I rudely welcomed!It came in a raggedy box and the shoe itself was scratched and covered in factory debris. The black slider was broken so the metal bearing would fall out very easily. It appears someone applied super glue on the ridges to try and rectify the situation, and it failed miserably.What kind of company would have the audacity to send me such a piece of crap product?This is nowhere near Casino quality in terms of design and performance. So let's say it wasn't broken and gnarled up. It's still cheap looking. The picture makes it look really good though. Because it AT LEAST comes with the parts you see, it gets 1-star instead of ZERO."
3,"How can this happen in a ""good country""","What is happening to families will effect the future.Most people turn a blind eye to what is really happening to good mothers.This book highlights the belief that ""mothers who lose their children must have done something awful"" is a myth.Another very personal story which also addresses this myth is:A Lioness from Judea Roars: A Lioness from Judea Cries"
3,Missing Pages,"The book was great. However, I bought used and there were a couple pages missing right in the middle of it."
3,"Nobody will ever be Pac, period.","I bought Ja Rule's first album when my friend told me not to is because that I think he got potential. He proves himself and others that he is a hits maker with his next two album. His style of singing and mix of pop and hip-hop bring him a great deal of success, but his ego is also getting out of control. This album is more or less the same as the last album, with more pop mix song like ""Mesmerize"" feat Ashinti. Although most of his songs donesn't have much meaning other than sex and ""Murda"" references, the beats are never the less still good. But his foolish attempt of trying to be 2pac makes me laugh. Creating beef with DMX (duplicate Pac and Bigge), work with Pac's old lable, ""Death Row"" (Tha Row) are all childish attempts to be 2pac. Face it Ja Rule, you are not 2pac, you never was, never is, and never will be, so don't call youself Pac on the radio. Wake up !!"
3,Not so good the second time around,"Although I liked this book, I am disappointed with the main characters from Drama Queen not being the main characters this time around. I personally want to read a sequel that continues the storyline of the original main characters.Sigh...this book was drama filled, but I give it a C+ rating at best. Good Luck next time Ms. Hunt."
3,"Not great, but interesting","This movie is not by any means a GREAT film, but it does has its strong points. Kristofferson hits a bullseye as a hard drinking washed up rock star, and though the music they selected for him to sing is not that great (why didn't they let KRIS write some????), he gives it a sort of authentic charm, and most Kris fans should find it listenable. Other than ""Evergren,"" which is a great song, Streisand's songs in the film are mostly pretty bad, and she lacks feeling in this role. In fact, the major downfall for this movie is that Kris is so believeable in his role, and Barbra is not. It creates a sense of unbalance. Perhaps they should have let Rita Coolidge play his wife? At least then the roles would have been more balanced and the film would be considered historically more important (Rita does appear for a few seconds, with Tony Orlando.)"
2,not funny,"I think the authors have tried to make a funny novel, but I dont really think it was. Moreover the style of writing is not that good.Well personally, at the end of the book, when I thought about it, I didnt laugh when reading it, and I didn't gain anything from it"
3,Does not live up to hype,"I read this book as the title and premise intrigued me. As I continued to read it hoping it would improve I was disappointed.The hype or endorsements on the book are way overrated.Its not a horrible book - it is a light read but I didn't laugh once even though it was supposed to be humorous.If you want humor (laugh out loud)and a light mystery try Maddy Hunter's books - I can't wait for her next one! But this author, well I might read her next one but it sure won't be on my must buy list."
4,1992 A&P Airframe Textbook,This 1992 copy is a well presented version of the Airframe textbook. It has some information not included in the current 2003 version which is why I purchased it.
2,disappointing follow-up to Spirit Room,"I enjoyed Michelle Branch's debut album, The Spirit Room. It was full of catchy, guitar-driven songs. I downloaded her sophomore album, Hotel Paper, from iTunes. It was disappointing. The song material wasn't as good as Spirit Room. I found many of the songs too drab."
1,Greenies Dental Chews For Dogs,"Consumers Beware of Greenie products for dogs or cats. It contains a very toxic ingriedant called, Menadione Sodium Bisulfite {MSB},which is a synthetic {man made} form of Vitamin K3 and causes cancer, organ damage {kidneys,lungs,liver,and mucous membranes}. It is also in almost All dry and canned pet foods. Chech your ingredients on All of your pet treats and foods. This will kill your pets. Check to see if BHA,BHT,and propylne glycol are listed in your treats and foods, both dry and canned. These Will Kill pets."
5,I guess you could say Lark Rise to Candleford is my one weakness...,"I am not one to turn on the television when company comes to visit, but if they stayed too late on Saturday night while Lark Rise was airing I was sorely tempted.Lark Rise has been so enjoyable for me. I love period Dramas and I love wholesome entertainment with moral values. I love the thoughtful writing. And love it even more that I can watch it with my children whatever their age and enjoy the episodes as a family.This series will be greatly missed and in my opinion the creators have BIG SHOES to fill when they create their next series."
5,Give Birth to this DVD,I have a hunch the DVD will be made available outside the US but wherever I have to go to get a high quality copy. The VHS I own is faded. I saw it years ago as a teenager by channel surfing and took note and for the longest time I couldn't even find it in the video stores. Released back in 82' at a time when Sabbath and Ronnie James Dio ruled radio. Ommedon is my all time favorite [...] next to Darth Vader.
1,What was I thinking?!,"I bought this vaccum a few years ago and can lie to say the first year was great. The second year I had to replace the belt twice, filter 3 times and consistanly had a problem with it getting clogged. I have a fairly clean house, no kids, no pets just me and my spouse. No excuses. This vaccum sucks, and not in a good way!!!! I should have invested in something more reliable, uieter, and a much better sucking power......"
4,Good but not great,"The material is great, but the first edition (at least) suffers from enough typesetting flaws to make some content difficult to follow. There are several instances where the prose indicates some text is supposed to be highlighted in some way but it is not e.g; bold to indicate differences from an earlier code listing, or variables missing the distinguishing overlines resulting in incomprehensible formulae."
2,UNSAFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I purchased this for my 5 yr old son and he used it 1 time. He found it hard to keep his balance and kept falling off. One time he almost hit his head on the side of the pool. I think it needs to be made more stabilized so it doesn't tip as easily as it does. I took it away and am bringing it back to toys r us as I feel a child could really get hurt if they lose balance and are near the side of the pool. What is worse is the instructions say to stay in a water depth the depth of your child which means the shallow end which means more turning and more chance of falling off and hitting the side. I think it is very unsafe!!!
3,Good press with a terrible handle.,"The press functions well enough, but as other reviews have mentioned the handle is shotty. It's held on with bolts which get gunked-up with grease and crud. I have to disassemble the handle (with tools) to clean the press thoroughly. The coiled handle doesn't stay cool enough to touch anyway, so why not use a one-piece design like the Lodge panini press? One good bonus this press offers is I can use it as a lid for the Lodge 6.5"" skillet, which doesn't have an available lid."
1,Where is the warning label for Copy Control Disc?,"How would I rate this album? I can't tell because I can't listen to it.Copy Control technology -- look it up on the net -- they can not even technically call this a Compact Disc as it does not adhere to the format standards. I think Amazon.ca should be required to notify people that the album they are selling features this technology and will not play on your computer (without adding their software), nor can you get it onto your ipod.Letters to EMI have gone unanswered so this is how I will show my displeasure -- I will not buy another EMI Canada disc so long as they use this technology. I'd rather eat the import premiums than give them another penny. Coldplay, Ben Harper, Chemical Bros"
2,"Insane, but funny.","This woman is the Kim Jong Il of American publishing. She will say absolutely anything to get attention, and it's obviously working. Insanity is lucrative these days.I expect her next heavily (if inaccurately) footnoted work will be an enthusiastic defense of Joseph Goebbels. ""He wasn't such a bad guy!""The woman certainly knows how to channel a raving lunatic. Bonus star for being so funny."
4,Fits my son,"These were purchased to keep my son protected. They fit him well and he uses the strap in the back. They look good also. The only problem I see is they seem to get a bit of fog on the inside. I don't know if that could be prevented. Hey, racquetball is a sweaty sport! Overall, my 13 year old doesn't complain about wearing them."
5,Awesome,"I first heard the liam lynch song &quot;whatever&quot; on the tony hawk commercial. But since i work at Target, I bought the cd. What an amazing deal. 15 songs, plus a free dvd with it, thats.... awesome!!"
2,Chain Saw Broken Upon Receipt,"I was going to buy an electric chain saw at my local Lowe's. But they increased the price on the one I wanted by $10 [to $100]- so I decided to order one from Amazon. I had it shipped via UPS ground. Well, I guess that UPS dropped or threw it like in the Christmas video [on TV]. When I took it out of the box, the chain was real loose. I thought, well, maybe that's the way that they normally send them. Then, the chain would not tighten. I took off the bar clamp, and the ""bar adjusting pin"" fell off into my hand. I called the Poulan help line - and they are going to send me a new pin. But, he didn't apologize. I guess that he thought I was lying. Anyway, the point is that it should work right out of the box [after you add the bar oil of course].I was thinking about buying a 3-D LG TV from Amazon. But after this, I wonder if it would arrive in pieces.As for the chain chaw, I guess it would be a better item to buy from your local store."
2,SONIC'S FINAL G.B.A.,"SONIC'S FINAL GAMEBOY APPEARENCE IS SONIC GENESIS 06 EDITION.I WAS HIGHLY DISSAPOINTED.ALL THE GAME IS SONIC GENESIS ON GAMEBOY!THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THAT YOU CAN USE THE SPIN DASH.IF THEY WERE SMART THEY WOULD HAVE ADDED THE HOMING ATTACK AS WELL,AND PUT IN THE CURRENT MAIN CHARACTERS(TAILS,KNUCKLES,AMY,CREAM,SHADOW,ROUGE,SILVER,BLAZE,METAL SONIC,AND THE CHAOTIX)AS SECRET CHARACTERS.ALL WITH THE SAME ATTACKS THOUGH.EGGMAN WHOULD HAVE STAYED THE VILLIAN."
4,Great Product for a Low Price,I needed a radio/IPOD player for the patio. This product was perfect. It can run on batteries or be used with an AC adaptor. Great quality sound for such a low price. The remote is a nice feature.
4,"Some were good, some were bad","I agree with what many of you are saying and that the markers are arriving dried out. I purchased 4 boxes - 2 of them were worthless - dry and left a very faint mark. The other 2 boxes were fantastic! Nice, bold, dark, and the fine tip was perfect! That is why I am giving this 4 stars.5 STARS to Amazon's customer service! They replaced the 2 boxes that were defective (arrived the next day). Unfortunately these 2 boxes were dried up as well so I am having to send them back but Amazon is making it right. Kuddos to them!1 star to Bic's Quality Control department. Bic should take some extra care in this area and hopefully they are paying attention to these reviews. We have come to expect more from a company like Bic. How sad to tarnish your reputation because your QC people aren't doing their job.Glad to know that Amazon is doing everything they can to fix the problem! They will have my business for a LONG time to come!"
4,Outstanding footwear,"Quality craftmanship, great looks. I got tired of the cheap shoes at bargain stores as they do not last and wear out quickly. Worth paying the extra dollars."
3,good movie,i like this movie that he is in. i had to wait for the cost to go down for a year and i finally had got it. i think that if you are a big usher fan that you will have to see this movie. you will love it for sure.
3,Pure hype,So I ordered this DVD sfter reading the reviews.My take on the DVD is though it is thin on instructions but still not very difficult to follow.By second time you get the moves but i didn't find it very challenging and didn't feel the burn.Currently I use perfect abs which has given me impressive results but I have plateaued so i was looking to get something else but after doing thid DVD a few times I think i will revert to Perfect abs.
3,A Dog Year,"It was a very cute story, great action with the dog, but whatever happened to to the second Rectriever who was left behind? Never any mention of him.Jeff Bridges was outdone by the border Collie!Maybe fun for children."
2,Not a Unisex scent,"It was hard for me to understand this scent. It smells like a light spice with a dominating green, herbaceous scent that it obvious. Yes it could be tagged as unique but people around me have mixed feelings about this."
5,Mr. B. Duhn,"Terrific hit with our son-in-law, in fact we will more than likely order one for ourselves. It's light weight but durable."
5,Gritty 70's police drama,"Great flick from a time when these raw, gritty films brought people back into movie theaters after a long decline in attendance. Contains one of the definitive car chase scenes, shot live on the streets of New York City. Roy Scheider and Tony LoBianco turn in great performances. A great night of entertainment, and if you remember the New York City of the 1970's, before it was sanitized and primped for bored (and boring) suburban tourists cattle herding themselves through our once real streets with their shopping bags of overpriced junk, you will long for the time when the City was actually a real, working city - warts and all."
2,Not Durable,Bought this for my sons room. Cool concept and very appealing to children but not constructed well. Had it for one month and was refilling tank one day and it slipped in the sink- wouldn't even say I dropped it- and plastic tank cracked. Now its completly unusable and replacement tank is almost as much as buying another one. That is most disappointing of all when parts cost as much as item itself. Not ideal unless you're ok with things breaking easily.
5,So Refreshing!,"I attended a conference at Heritage International Ministries (where Suzy often leads worship) in 2006. I heard some of these songs live, and I liked them, so I purchased the CD. My husband and I started playing it in the mornings to help us wake up. And what a wake-up it is! I have to confess I didn't like the whole album at first, but it really grew on me. Of course, as the other reviewer said, it's best to hear it live. BUT if you can't fly to the Carolinas every day, this is the next best thing. : ) The lyrics are so fresh and full of meaning. I'll be listening to this one for many years to come. **NOTE!*** Don't buy the remix album. It was disappointing."
1,Didn't work on my NTSC player!,"Amazing Race (2002) Season 2I live in Australia, and have purchased many DVDs from Amazon (including the Amazing Race 1 and 2) and found this one did not work in my NTSC player at all. As I assume from one of the comments this one is burned, which I found out too late! But Amazon have been great about me returning them, and replacing just in case I had a bad one. I have had 3 copies so far and non have worked. Just a note for all AR fans, so you don't end up as disappointed as I was unable to watch!"
2,eh.,"This book concludes with thinly veiled Mormon theology that makes it inappropriate for use in Christian study groups. However, viewed as a secular work, this may be useful for some people. Avoid the many knick-knacks, doodads, and complementary products that are also sold under the Covey name."
4,I really am in love with a Princeton mathematician!,"This book was recommended to me (for obvious reasons) and I enjoyed it very much. The main character seems so insecure, though, and I found myself feeling sorry for her. So many of the feelings and things she was going through mirror my own life! As I turned each page I began to think my own boyfriend may have been used as her model! Unlike Noam Himmell, however, the ""real thing"" is quite loving and attentive."
3,"Good info, ragged book","The information is good and I received the book on time. The book itself had several pages that were irregularly cut and some pages have stickers on them that look like some kind of tracking number. Others just have plain white stickers like they are covering up something but they aren't. The edges of several pages have stains, like spilled coffee or something.I received a note from the company, with my order, regarding the book's ""new condition"" and ""minor imperfections"", saying they would issue a partial credit to my account. I don't know if they did - I haven't checked. I will keep the book because it is useable and frankly, it's just too much of a pain to bother with returning it.I have purchased many books and products from Amazon and this is the first time I have been disappointed!"
2,great art but poor labels,"I bought this book for my daughter who is interested in human anatomy. The two stars are for the illustrations, which are incredibly detailed and well executed. The microscopic scale of the entire layout on the other hand is absolutely ridiculous for an art book. Even with the steadiest hand and perfect vision it would be hard to color in the individual segments or find the corresponding label for it. The fond used for the labels and other identification is badly chosen (I guess the ""handwriting"" style, or close to it, is to look friendly and less like a textbook, but it is actually very hard to read), and also miniscule.In short, this book needs to be re-published at a much larger scale in order to live up to its promises. I found it entirely useless and returned it."
4,Great for casual use.,"Great for casual use.I like the flash, but I have read some reviews that say you have to watch how fast you use it, so if you plan to use it a lot at a time do some more research, and make sure it is what you want. If you going to use it once or twice and then wait a few min you will be fine. As I said in the title it is great for casual use."
4,great for the little jobs,"For all normal intents and purposes, this is a wonderful power screw driver. Maybe not for heavy duty construction use, but I'm very happy using it for light duty work around the home. The power is decent, and the ease of use can't be beat."
1,I'm really disappointed,"I bought this as a present, but the minute that I turned it off it didn't turned on anymore. The battery is terrible, I don't recommend for anybody."
2,mill is a problem,"The mill over grinds beans. For a ""flat"" filter versus a ""cone"" filter the grind should be on the large side. If you set the mill to the lowest setting the beans are hardly ground at all, on the next setting the beans are ground into dust, i.e. espresso grind.The latch over the mill broke on mine.When this machine finally dies I'll go back to one without the integrated mill."
5,Better than sliced Bread!,"Excellent product- greatest thing since sliced bread, actually, better since I haven't used sliced bread as drawers...Extremely comfortable, washable, breathe in hot weather, never bind up. Gotta go for now, off to ordere some more of these.Highly reccomend."
2,"River, Cross My Heart - Not What I Expected","Just wasn't what I expected. The jumping from before to after the death was very distracting. I expected more of a ""story"" after reading the back of the book... it said it was about how Georgetown dealt with the death of a child... it really wasn't about that much at all. It did have some nicely written, description moments... getting caught at the pool made my heart sink.."
2,Not the best in tent camping,"I thought this book would be helpful in our move to socal, but I was not impressed with the selection of campsites, organization, or even the campsites featured. The first campground we went to that was supposedly the highest rated in the area had, guess what...RVs, concrete slabs, and loud radios. Maybe the problem is not the book, but southern california. I would suggest real tent campers find another book."
3,Alice still Rocks!!!,"This is a good CD definitely worth buying if you are new to the world of Alice. However, I am not a big fan of best of/greatest hits album if you are like me and already have all of his studio albums anyway. There is some live tracks on this album which is pretty cool plus a cover of the Jimi Hendrix tune Fire but not much you haven't heard before making this a good album but I'd spend my money buying other Alice first."
3,The Amazing Power of Intent,"I thought this book did not compare in any way to the marvelous book by Wayne Dyer's The Power of Intention, a great read. Too many childish quick ways to get IT!. Not a quick thing the art of allowing. Takes scholars years to learn the art of allowing. The great School Ramtha, "" The School of Enlightment) all the students, from all over the globe spend months and some years to get to the ART of Allowing. This book does not have much to say in reality what allowing spiritually means to individuals, how to access that. On occasion within the pages a great glimmer of it seeps through however so rarely not worth thelong read to get it. yes Wayne Dyer gives it a compliment. AS for me I will read Tulle and of course all of Dyers books as fast as he writes them, as the older he becomes, the better his read."
4,Makes many valid points about America's desire for war,"This book, although written by a Conservative, gives plenty to think about, by Liberals, Moderates, and Conservatives. Mr. Bacevich lays out the uses and abuses of military power, by the civilian leadership, over the last 20+ years, and does so with skill. He makes many valid points, including, how Congress has abdicated its responsibility, to declare war; based on the notion of supporting the ""commander in chief"" (i.e., The President). He also lays out a course of action that should involve using war as a last resort. He does not say that America shouldn't defend itself, but use war more effectively. While one might not agree with all of his ideas, he provides more thought out strategy (something the previous administration especially did not do, when going to war, and which has partly [partially] led to our current problems.) Worth a look."
2,Doesn't quite hit the mark,I've purchased the original PCM encoded CD more than once because I enjoy this album so much. I was happy to see this album release in surround sound but was disappointed by the lack of content and very disappointed with the fact that I still can't figure out how to fast-forward through songs on the 5.1 side of the disc. Why would you disable that option? I guess the people who made the disc had a lot of extra time on their hands from not having to add extra content to the CD. The recording label obviously wants the quick income of reselling this album without having to put any effort into remixing it or adding content.
1,not happy!!!,I thought it was going to be great. I used this in the Caymen Islands and thought it worked great taking under water pictures while snorkling and visiting Sting Ray City. The next day we went to swim whith the Dolphins and I couldn't take any pictures!! Some how water got into the camera!!!I didn't do anything different so I was not happy it ruined all my pictures on the SD card...
2,A Let Down !,"A long time fan of Cornwall's - I jumped at the chance of reading her latest. What a let down. I cannot believe this is the same author. While a change of direction could present the readers a pause, this effort was not satisfying. I continue to be a fan - she has provided hours of pleasure. So I think I will reserve judgement and condemnation for her next novel. Perhaps that will tell us all if we have lost the reason so many of us have burned the midnight oil. Patricia - please make it worth the wait and shut the critics up"
3,G-rated,Cute guys but like most books in this genre the title misleading suggests more erotic pictures than you will actually find. Most of the guys are wearing briefs. You can see about as much on prime time television. But again the guys are cute...just don't expect a grand erotic experience.
2,Probably not the whole movie,"I ordered the VHS previously, and I had forgotten one thing: this is a really LONG movie. It easily rates 2 VHS tapes, and I learned.It's the story of the Australian singer Johnny O'Keefe, and It's a great movie. If you can get the whole thing."
4,Refreshing & Complete,"Anyone who trashes this movie either hasn't truly seen it, or suffers from lousy taste and a non-existent sense of humor. I admit the previews made it look like some ill-conceived cliche. But when my wife rented the DVD, I was surprised to find a storyline that's incredibly creative with no holes. It also features some sensational acting (the Chaucer character and Rufus Sewell in particular).FYI, this isn't Shakespeare; if you got a bang out of watching Raymond Burr in Othello, it's not for you. However, A Knight's Tale is far from the predictable action pulp we usually get. This is one of the funnest most enjoyable movies I've seen in past years. Give it a chance."
5,Perfect Fit/ EL Is ff/Great Price,Perfect Fit and length for my 2001 Honda Accord ULEV Engine. Got it at a Great Price and delivered on time. My Engine Light came off within 24 hours and I was able to reset my maintenance light too.Thank you AmazonDenso 234-9014 Oxygen Sensor (Air and Fuel Ratio Sensor)
4,Great Little DVD Player,"This little DVD player is just the thing for taking to the gym. It fits on the rack of any exercise machine. I plug in my headphones, start the movie, and run. Sometimes I run an extra 10 minutes just to finish the movie I'm watching. Afterwards, I just slip it into my gym bag. The battery has been lasting close to 3 hours. However, when I bought it, the charger it come with didn't work. I did have to buy my own charger at Radio Shack. I've been using it for 6 months now."
1,Bad sounds,"I really dislike the quality of this product. It is really bad !!The sounds of the songs were awful, I have to buy the same product but different brand :(("
2,Heavy on Cases Light on Content,"Apply the cost of this book to the purchase of Robert S. Kaplan's ""The Balanced Scorecard"" and, perhaps, ""Cost & Effect."" (I'm assuming that almost every reader already has a copy of Michael Hammer's and James Champy's ""Reengineering the Corporation."") The author's tend to quote the leading authorities in activity based costing, balanced scorecards, and process reengineering liberally and follow each quote with an endless stream of supporting cases. Outside of these celebrity quotes and the mind-numbing quantity of cases, there is a surprising lack of content -- I'm almost tempted to write the authors to request a refund.(Believe me, this two-star rating is extremely generous!!!)"
2,Poor quality.,Pros...Best toast settings we could find in a toaster oven today.Cons...Had to post a review of this item after it broke during the 1st week of service. Toaster dial knob broke. Free wheeled. I could have returned it but fixed it instead (void warranty or not). Loaded knob is super glue and stuck it back on. Still working.Also noisy timer. Annoying.
1,"Unhappy, terrible system","Worked for a little, need to pack paper in the battery area to make it work. Also antennas on mics fall off and mics cut out intermittently. We use this in a church and its never reliable. Also pyle does not stand behind this and during the warranty period we would have to pay for repairs to them and shipping."
3,Snore..,"2 hours of ploddingly dull progressive house. Just mindnumbingly boring. I enjoyed the first CD of his GU 14, and I enjoy his mixes with Sasha (Communicate and Northern Exposure are both excellent), but I just couldn't bring myself to listen to this a second time.Excellent, seamless mixing, though, but so what?"
4,Did the trick,I put in an accent light in the rear of my property for a interesting tree. Needed a way to power it without doing significant wiring. This helped make it work..
4,Great product!,"This carpet powder worked wonders. No flea problems now where we put it. Actually, I gave it 4 stars because of the price. There is powder at Walmart for less than $4.00 that worked the same."
2,Words repeated too often.,"My wife bought this game for us as a gift (and we both enjoy the non-electronic version), but after only a few games, words started repeating -- and kept repeating. There may be 2,200 words in there, but we've only seen a few dozen (and we keep seeing them).We've given up on it. The regular version is still a winner, but the electronic game is junk."
3,A well written novel but I lost interest in it.,"Probably because Ms. Woolf did too much TELLING and not enough SHOWING. Maybe that's why the novel is so thin. For a better representation of 20th century literature, read Hemingway's ""The Sun Also Rises,"" Faulkner's ""The Sound and the Fury,"" and Salinger's ""The Catcher in a Rye."" The reason I bought ""Mrs. Dalloway"" was because I enjoyed Cunningham's ""The Hours."" What a disappointment."
1,DON'T BUY THIS DEFECTIVE UNIT!!!! DEAD on ARRIVAL,"Right out of the box the pump failed to remove water, as did the hose option and even the bucket option. I was told there must be some ""sensor"" problem; to get it repaired or replaced I have to pay for this huge heavy machine to be shipped to another state- at the cost of perhaps 1/4 of what I paid in the first place. Don't Buy this product!!"
3,"Not bad for a ""chick lit"" book","I don't usually like these types of books because they are so predictable but for whatever reason, I enjoyed this one.I think that the writing was decent and offered some insights into the characters though they were not always truly believable.Rachel is the quiet, shy one with a wallflower personality. Her best friend Darcy is the outgoing, egotistical one who thinks that the world revolves around her. Darcy is engaged to Dex and Rachel is the maid of honor at the upcoming nuptials. Things go wrong however once Rachel and Dex have a one night stand. Rachel and Dex are confused over this situation but continue to have a relationship.What follows is their tangled romance and the approaching date of Darcy and Dex's wedding.I think that parts of the story were truly funny and realistic but I felt a little let down at the end in the way that Dex and Rachel's relationship was redeemed."
2,"Blab, Blab, Blab","The movie selections included in this collection are OK, but over all disapointing. Information that was provided regarding the actual content was vague. One movie listed on the box was not included in the movies sent. The picture on the box shown on this review does not match the box I ordered."
1,Multiple kinks on first try,"I bought this cable for my BrassCraft 400 since the one that originally came with it broke after 4+ years of use. Since Brasscraft is the manufacturer of Cobra products, I figure this would be a fitting replacement. A couple months after my purchase, the cleanout was backing up so it was my first opportunity to try the new cable. To my disappointment, the cable went no further than 20 feet before I couldn't feed the line any longer. When I pulled out the cable, there were multiple kinks along the cable. This is the same cleanout I've used the previous cable for the past 4 years without fail. When I compared the new cable with the previous one, the new cable appears to be made of a softer material and I could easily create a kink by slightly bending the cable."
5,Sparkly!,"My husband got me this chain for Christmas, and I love it! The twist in the chain gives it a very sparkly look as light moves across it. The 20"" length is perfect for showing off a pendant. It's also quite strong and the clasp is secure."
2,Cornwell jumps the shark,"Very disappointing work. Her book on Jack the Ripper obviously didn't do well enough, so she rushed out this stinker. The only cliche she left out was the evil twin,...wait there are two evil twins in this. ;-)She is much too talented to produce this stuff. Blame also goes to Putnam for putting this out. Should have gone directly to paperback or maybe under a pseudonym."
1,would love to actually watch this film,"The copy I've got refuses to load in three different dvd players. It plays a bit then goes crazy. The disc seems fine but the film itself goes all digital and spotty, as if it is poorly made?Anyway thought I'd let folks know."
2,"The ""old"" Strategy Guide",I'm an adult--agewise. This book will not be much help beyond the game guide that came with the game software. The basic strategy recommendation for single player was made obsolete by a software patch released after the strategy guide was published. One or two minor points were in the strategy guide that I did not pick up from the game documentation. The game website has better strategy hints for free! Save your money for something better or an updated edition. The multiplayer strategy said than human players were unpredictable and most of the single player strategies were not appropriate. There's a news flash for the cable news channels!!!
2,Clasp hard to work and broken,"Really nice watch as pictured. Clasp came broken. Watch is big. Strap is very long. I am 5'9 male, slim athletic build, the excess strap goes three quarters of the way to the face. I returned it and kept the 233XLTTM, similar watch but in titanium: that clasp worked. I would have kept the black one too, if the clasp had worked. I know I could have exchanged it, but wasn't worth the hassle to me. I like them because they are so lightweight. I'd be interested to see how it holds up in a few years."
1,Do not buy this product!,"This is not a reliable product. I had to return the main battery (overheated and the auxillary battery (NC2B, dead on arrival)once each while they were under warranty. Now that the warranty has expired I have nothing but toxic electronic waste for disposal! The manufacturer will not/cannot repair the defective system. They will not stand behind their product.I notice that the big box retailers (Best Buy & Fry's) aren't carrying this system any more. DO NOT BUY!"
1,This superman is NOT made of steel,BREAKS very easy - this is why we stopped selling these... almost everyone shipped out had a complaint about the hand falling off... Manufacturer defect on all these.. worst sup toy ever seen...very poor quality
4,Pretty good,"I like these cards, they're beautiful and easy to read. The Traveler's Guide is amusing and a good guideline for making your own magickal world, like mine, Dhniria. I dislike that they don't describe the cards in real detail, but otherwise, fine. One word of advice: these cards may not suit you, they are very elaborate and cat-themed. Sometimes you just can't read decks that don't suit you, get what I mean??? Also, as the reviewer before me pointed out, these are in different worlds, but I find that they're more similar to real life than you might think."
1,Captive to this movie for 85 minutes,"I'm not a big fan of torture cinema, especially if the audience are the ones being tortured. This movie was so terrible I had to fight to sit all the way through it. Ms Cuthbert is easy on the eyes, but her character was so shallow she was hard to identify with. And there wasn't really a whole lot done to her. When the male captive is first brought in its easy to see where things are going, and the big reveal is a letdown. A better movie, with better acting, is BROKEN."
4,Good water bowl,this bowl works great the tortoises have easy access for the water bowl it would be better if it was a couple inches bigger but otherwise works great for one at a time
2,Software stinks,"Even though it says right on the box supports WinXP, the software that comes with it locks my computer up. I searched all over the internet and finally found 1 link to an upgraded version 3.0. I would assume KDS would have a link on thier site and regular updates to it, but they didnt. Really, one would think on thier site, you could upgrade the software for it. The 3.0 software does work, but its extremely slow on a 1.6 gig with 1024ddr, and 50% of the time just quits responding when you try to load it."
1,9x13 shattered in the oven,We just had our 9x13 Anchor glass cooking pan shatter in the oven with 2 minutes left in cooking our Thanksgiving stuffing. I literally saw it happen waiting for the stuffing to finish cooking. The recipe was 45 minutes at 400F. I have my doubts on how oven safe these actually are.
2,Thor- good effects and a lousy script.,Thor- good effects and a lousy script. it could have been much better. I'm glad I didn't have to pay to see it.
3,A Very Violent Yet Worthy Film,"I am a big fan of Japanese film and was eiger to see this title. Just the premise of 42 9th grade juvenile delinquents set loose on a deserted island with the objective of killing each other to win their own lives was intriguing. It was very violent but not as bad as I expected. It was no more violent than the director's cut of Robocop. Still, a bunch of kids in school uniforms going on a murderous rampage was kind of unsettling. It's not a wonder why it was pulled from Japanese theatres. I don't think this will ever make it to US theatres without an NC-17 rating.There is a current of dark humor running through the film and it is for this that I give the movie 3 stars. It also seems to be a parody of the currently popular reality TV shows. Although I have mixed feelings about it, I'm glad I saw it."
2,CD Was Not As Expected,"Tye Tribbett Victory Live album comes up short in my opinion. The last album was spectacular. But Victory live was not compose properly, the music did not flow right, the choir was off. It was more of look how skillfull our musicians are. I only like two-1/2 songs of the entire album. Track 2, 11, and 16. I like 16 because I saw the video. If I did not see the video, the would be a disappointment. Tye, I know you are trying to do something different but the lyrics was not uplifting to me. I felt I would have wrote those lyrics. We need to write music that are not some cliche'.Other than that keep up the good work."
5,Compelling,"This book really left me marveling at the situation Mormons find themselves in - there is so much to recommend the culture that has grown up around the religion, and yet it's based on what is, to an outsider, silly stuff. I didn't understand until reading this the dynamics around the Smart kidnapping. The sexism which is inherent in LDS (fundamental or not) is invidious."
4,Overall great stools,"I bought one set of these stools about 6 months ago, and another set recently. They come fully assembled, which is really fantastic. I HATE assembling furniture, and it's so nice that you just have to take these stools out of the box and you're done. They are packaged really well and come in good condition. They look very nice/not cheap, but they are a reasonable price ($99 for a pair). The one thing that I don't like about these stools is that the wood tends to chip at the very bottom of the stool legs. That's kind of a drag, but a little wood glue fixes that. All in all, very satisfied with this purchase."
2,So so movie with crappy art whore ending,"**REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILER***I like a good slasher movie, the more gore the better. I like suspense and drama too. This movie tried to combine them all - and actually did a fairly decent job. It could of been a solid 3 star beauty in the rough. HOWEVER, I'm getting a little miffed at movies that have an anti-hero ending simply to make it more artsy or make the director feel like there's some kind of deep meaning. Some life changing moment in film.That's fine and dandy if your owning a 5 star file (for instance Cold Mountain - kills the hero and still ends up being a fine movie). Or your solid Trauma type movies like ""Hobo with a shotgun"" - ending MAKES that movie a solid 3 star gore fest.If your a decent little 3 star movie and your going for that 4th star by killing your hero, just don't do it. It pisses me off. Anyway that's my rant. Thanks for reading."
5,leather seat conditioner,I bought a box of 6 so I can give them away as gifts. I like the product because it conditions the leather and leaves my interior smelling great!
1,Women's golf shoes,This shoe is very stiff and uncomfortable and seems to run small - I ended up taking them to a consignment sports store to sell.
3,Not Bad,"It's A nice alarm clock, don't get me wrong. It's got a wireless outdoor theromter and ir runs on batteries. Don't really use the projection feature and the led isn't blue it'e green but it's still visible at night. Cool features such as indoor/outdoor temp, and humidity are nice to have espcially out here in afghanistan."
5,The Truth about God...Finally!!,"I have read every one of Neale's books and they are all amazing! The human race was long overdue to have someone step out of the shadows of organized religion and all the fear-based theologies and finally bring the true nature of God to the forefront. You may not agree with everything said in Neale's books, and you don't have to. Simply take the concepts and apply them to your life and see what happens. No longer must we fear things like Hell and Satan, as this book makes very clear, we have made them both up. We created Satan and Hell in order to scare people into behaving as we would like them to behave, when the truth is God is ALL there is! He is in everything and works and moves through everything. Do yourself a favor and read his books, and when you're done, recommend them to everyone you know. They will thank you for doing so. ;)"
3,THE VIGILANTE FORCE,"Once you accept the premise that a band of vigilante cops is sanctioned by higher authorities, SCARRED CITY is a watchable crime thriller. The stoic Stephen Baldwin does little to heighten his acting persona, but again his laconic often soporific demeanor works in his favor as the cop who finds himself a member of a group of lawmen who take the law into their own hands, ultimately becoming as vile as the perps they are killing. Chazz Palminteri and Tia Carrere are along for the ride, and Carrere shows a fine singing voice in a couple of songs she performs as the typical hooker with a heart of gold. The action scenes are well staged and although the plot itself is Swiss Cheese, it entertains and fulfills what you expect."
4,Rush bring it home!,"In our modern and jaded age, it is refreshing to hear an incredible band such as Rush defy the shallowness of contemporary music and summon up a work as powerful as 'Test for Echo.' The lyrics prove themselves to be as poignant as ever, Lifeson's guitars are unrelenting and melodic, Neil Peart's drumming is...well, come on now, it's Neil Peart...and Geddy Lee's bass playing and vocals are at once synchronized and profound. It is, in short, a more than worthy release from a band that has seen it's fair share of releases. And now, with Rush rejoined and working on new studio material for the first time since this 1996 release, I think it is doubly important for us to hear this great album, and glean from it what we can expect from Rush in the future. Such tracks as 'Test for Echo', 'Driven', 'Totem', and 'Dog Years' remind the listener that this is a band, not only alive and kicking, but never missing a step of the race!"
3,"Love the fresh perked coffee, but be careful.....","I always hated the drip machines and tried my luck with an electric percolator. It stopped working after less than a month of use. Thankfully the store took it back. That is when I decided to just get an old fashioned stovetop percolator, just like Grandma always used. I bought this pot from Amazon after reading many reviews for different pots out there. I must say I love fresh brewed coffee. However there are more ""floaties"" in my cup then I was led to believe from the reviews. I tried to brew with a filter in the basket. Don't do it. It doesn't work! Also, be very careful when washing this pot. I found out the hard way, the spout edges are VERY SHARP. I sliced my thumb pretty badly while I was rinsing it."
5,Quality is A-1.,"As described, great product, got excatly as pictured. Would buy again. Quality is A-1. What else need I say? I am well satisfied."
5,Dying hound grasps for life,"I've lived in the Oregon coast range for the past 21 years and in Oregon since 1966. This is it. When our Golden Retreiver/Border Collie got on the trail of something[deer, elk, bear?] in 35 degree rain and didn't come back for 19 hours, all I could think of was Kesey's ability to get inside the dog's head in Great Notion and how Nicky was feeling while desperately trying to find her way back home through the checkerboard of clear-cuts, old growth and everything in between that makes up the tangle of the Umpqua/Siuslaw divide. If you want to understand Western Oregon and [old growth] Oregonians, this is the best book to read...it may well be the Great American novel...I first read it in '66, and on rereading found it had lost nothing...all bow to the Springfield Creamery and the bus trip from the Farm to the Springfield Xmas parade on a rainy Saturday in '66..."
3,"Good information, just a bit long-winded.","OK, I got several books as gifts (new father) and this was one of them. Plenty of great info, but the writing style is dry."
4,Good book,"It's tearing a bit, but that's what happens when one makes a purchase of a used item. Overall, I am satisfied with the purchase."
3,be sure you're a fan,"if you're new to guided by voices you may want to steer clear of this one. even me, a hardcore fan, needed time to warm up to this EP. previous reviews are undeniably correct, some of the tracks are barely audible. however, as is the case with every gbv release, there are gems of genius that make sunfish holy breakfast worth getting (e.g. Contest Featuring Human Beings, Winter Cows, If We Wait)."
1,Microsoft doesn't support their own products!,"I've been burned by Microsoft twice before with Sidewinder joysticks. The first time I bought one was when I had Windows 98. It was a Sidewinder Pro. Great joystick, plug n play, all that. When I migrated to Windows 2000, I found that the Sidewinder Pro was not supported (despite being analog--you'd think it would be easy to program drivers for it). I thought, ""Okay, maybe there are problems, blah blah blah."" I then bought a Sidewinder Force Feedback Pro, again, great product, plug n play, all that. Worked great. When I migrated again to Windows XP I found AGAIN it wasn't supported by Microsoft. There is NO reason why a company such as Microsoft cannot support their own products on their own operating system. I will NEVER buy a Sidewinder again. I can't trust them. Buy anything else. I've had great luck with the Wingman Digital Extreme--$$$ at ......--excellent buy!"
4,Don't listen to that Bruce Richardson guy.,"He obviously knows nothing about music. First of all, who buys a CD without knowing what it is? ""Oh wow! These must be the real state songs recorded by John Linnell of They Might Be Giants. I don't like They Might Be Giants so I think I'll buy this album!""--(not an actual Bruce Richardson quote)This album is really great if you're looking for something a little different from top 40 sludge. It drags in a few places but overall it is very worthwhile. John Linnell is an amazingly gifted and original songwriter. Bruce Richardson on the other hand, is not."
1,"3/3 1"" valves leaking","I bought the 3 valve manifold with the inline 1"" valves. I installed them and they leaked immediately. They seemed to be leaking from the top valve lid area as well as the solenoids. I took these valve assemblies off, wrapped all threaded areas with liberal amounts of teflon tape (it says 7-8 times around in the manual) and reinstalled them. Still leaked badly. Not a slow drip but rather steady so my box was always damp and full of water and black widows, etc..I will try to replace these with Toro valves as another reviewer had good luck with them.I spent $58.00 or so for the manifold and 3 valve inline kit at Home Depot-money wasted if you ask me.Do not buy, get something better quality, save money in the long run."
4,city heat from amazon.com,"Entertaining as all get-out. Cinematic license in the fights and shoot-out scenes, of course, but still entertaining. Wisecracking was a plus.Kurt"
3,Needs Work to Work,"I think Norpro needs to upgrade their packaging. When I open the undamaged box that contained the slicer, I found the wooden frame broken in three places. Nothing else in the order was damaged, and the slicer was not the most fragile item in the box. Since it would be a pain to ship it back, and since I do a little wood working, I decided to keep it and repair it myself.After the repair I see that I like the concept, but the plastic cutting guides could be made with thicker material. They flex too much."
4,This Game is the BEST!(...),"This game is the best. It is better than the PC, Gameboy and Gamecube versions, because face it the Playstation 2 is the best. It has PRO players like Ichiro, Alfonso Soriano, Alex Rodriguez, Sammy Sosa, Nomar Garciaparra, Carlos Delgado, Barry Bonds, Dontrelle Willis and you can unlock people like Mike Piazza, Derek Jeter, Randy Johnson and Pedro Martinez. This game is the best and it does not matter if your 5 or 30, if you like baseball, BUY THIS GAME!(...)"
1,If you like to waste a time and money.,"Going to the movies is in general very fun thing for me and even if the film is not so very good, eating good pop corn and drinking coke is enough for me. But when I went to se this film all my body was irretated and couldnt be still in the seat. After the first half I should have listened to my heart and left the building but I had a little wish that the second half would save the evening. But it just got worse. It leaves a big ugly spot on Bill Pullman which I just loved in ""While you were sleeping"" and has done a good job in other films. Ellen dont quit your day-job(because your shows are fine). But Mr. Director were you in a hurry???"
1,A DVD made for killers....,"This film tells the viewer nothing about the Green River killer. Its poorly filmed (filmed under water?), the sound is bad and the acting is at a grade school play level. It spends alot of time focusing on the murders devoid of context, merely glorifying the violence.Skip it."
4,Still holds up after all these years,"This is a fabulous album of garage rock. The Del Fuegos were the Zanes brothers, Don and Warren, along with Woody Glessmann on drums and Tom Lloyd on bass. Released in 1985 this was their first national album, and it still holds up next to the neo-punk of the new millennium. Almost every song of the ten is a keeper. These guys came to my attention via a Miller beer TV ad series that featured about-to-break-out acts in various local music scenes. Anyone else remember that? ""Don't Run Wild"" is the big hit, but the entire album is great."
2,So disappointed,I loved the book. And a book obviously is allowed to be wordy. But not a film. The film was literally like the actors sitting with a copy of the book saying lines. It was all words with bits of good scenery. Ian Mckellen once again saved the film and Audrey Tatou wasn't too bad. Left out some parts and I was not happy with the outcome
5,total entertainment,My grandkids will watch these over and over and over. They have learned a lot from these.!
5,A really great show.,"If your looking for something with everything, a great cast, story line, and writers who actually know what their doing, seroiusly watch this show & buy it on DVD. Its never boring, funny, sad, crazy but never boring. No matter what you like its got something you'll like and not to mention you'll get hooked on the story line. So yeah I think its a really great show and i dont really like most shows so thats something. Buy this."
3,Not Compelling Enough For Drabble,"First of all this is my second Drabble book. I read ""The Seven Sisters"" and was delighted. Drabble has the bitter tone down cold. Simply put, I like how she captures the emotion of ""heartlessness."" But in ""The needles eye"" i've been having a hard time not getting distracted. It's not as followable. It reads like an old novel, like something people might have liked to read one hundred years ago. I keep forgetting who is the central character- rose or simon- and what's going on- and why I care about the Rose's legal problems. And why does Simon seem to be enamored of rose, and is there going to be an illicit sex scene here or not? And if Simon is just realizing that Rose and her ex-husband are meant for one another, what is the point? Who is Emily? I'm disappointed that it's not compelling enough. I want more exploration of Simon.... He is too invisible and yet he is the only thing that holds my interest ."
4,"Interesting, but slow","The Mayor of Casterbridge isn't really about a man who sells his wife and daughter. Yes, that is part of it, but 80% of the story has little to do with that fact. In actuality, it is about relationships, and the choices we make that can have an impact on those we love. The story twists and turns, and weaves several different characters' stories into one neat ending, but can be predictable at times.I personally enjoyed the book, but it can be slow and predictable at times, as I already mentioned."
1,Catch a Falling Star,"After listening to Enchantment at a listening station at Tower Records, I must agree with those who say that Charlotte is losing her voice. Both the energy and volume are lacking from previous works. The songs which are included in this CD from film and stage need far more attention than Charlotte now is able to give to them. The result is a rendering which just doesn't measure up. Even some fancy studio work is unable to mask the reality here and that is that Charlotte is no longer a legitimate recording artist like she was with her first album. Somebody needs to do something in an effort to salvage her voice before she can't sing at all. Hearing her in Enchantment is a tragedy considering that she was once on top of the world as a 12-year-old. I would suggest that anyone interested in hearing Charlotte when she could sing check out her Voice of an Angel CD. Then you will be able to relate to this review a little more."
3,Socks fit very well,"These socks fit very well, even over muscular calves. the quality is good but are very static-ey when they come out of the dryer. The navy blue socks are very dark, you can't tell them from black ones."
1,One more to add to the list!,"Here's one more anti-Islam book to add to the list. Short on research and long on rhetoric, it reads like a complaint letter about her dad and all the things she does not like!If you were thinking about reading this book to learn about Islam, DON'T! I recommend Jerald Dirks' Understanding Islam or John Esposito's What Everyone Should Know About Islam. Dirks is a graduate of Harvard Divinity School and an ordained minister who is a Muslim now. Esposito teaches at Georgetown University. You can also visit Islam101.com or whyislam.org for more info."
3,Not as cool as I hoped,"I am definately not a digital music expert but I know what I like. I heard the Afterlife track from these albums and bought them expecting the rest of the tracks to be similar. I was a bit dissapointed. I prefer a mix with at least some bit of memorable melody or sound but most of the tracks on here are monotonous excursions into the mundane. It may be a good background CD while you are doing something else that requires your full attention but it is not good for just listening. I found three of the 25 tracks to be enjoyable.Perhaps I prefer ""trance"" tracks to ""chill out"" tracks. The distinction is sublte but important. If you like trance, beware. If you like Digweed and Odenfold you might really like these albums. Just not my thing but it might be yours."
1,The code already used,The code was already used when I tried using it. I wasted over $18 on nothing. Very upset. DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU WISH TO LOOSE MONEY
2,The author who could not present himslef as an observer,the author could have come out of cantonment sentiment and describe - what he has - in more detail that why bengalis felt the way they had and then it would have been complete.
2,"Blah, blah, blah...heard it before!","I admit that this author suggests some nice things and I'm sure that if you work his program it may or may not work. The problem is that all of his suggestions are cliche and lacking in originality and freshness. Nothing new here, same old song and dance."
3,Sure that Hank Done it This Way,"The book details how Waylon became used but not used up through a series of exploits--many shameful. Extensive womanizing back when he truly was lonesome, ornery, and mean left many good-hearted women heartbroken. Waylon didn't have to reveal so much dirty linen from his past, but at least now we can be certain he had always been crazy but it kept him from going insane. He could and probably should have shown more regrets for some erstwhile indiscretions, but most likely his legacy will not forfeit the love of the common people because country's fans are loyal to a fault.Even if he thought he was too dumb for New York City and too ugly for L.A., he and many of his contemporary honky tonk heroes have considerably more talent than most of those warmed over rockers played on country radio today. The autobiography conclusively proves that we may have lost the wolf, but the wolf's music will survive."
1,Alphabet,"this item did not work ...it arrived defective..the sender returned my money....i was happy with that....had to toss the dvd,...no idea how good or bad it was"
4,Gentile Inspiring way to greet and finish out your day,"I purchased this DVD with a little trepidation, as I've never been very good at Yoga. As soon as I put the DVD in I began to feel a little better, as the instructor, Elena Brower, introduced the program and explained the purpose of the different segments.The AM section does exactly what it claims, incorporating movement between various poses to add a small bit of aerobic exercise in. By the end of the AM section I felt charged and fully awake.I would recommend this DVD to anyone looking to add Yoga into their fitness routine."
4,A Fine Weather Station,"This weather station is a very good one to own, aside from the cost, it is generally low maintenence, and is a wonderfully fun thing to own."
1,Maybe I'm doing something wrong,"I bought this after reading the great reviews. I have not used the scented insert thinking the filter can remove the orders. It does NOT!!! I have a very clean bathroom with a litter box in the bathroom. My cat uses the box once and it does not even remove the urine smell. I have better look covering the orders with a Yankee Candle insert that does not have a strong smell. I find this product to be a waste of money. Please note this is space is problem 5"" X 10"". So it's a very small space."
1,failed to work only after about one week,"I hooked up my PC with my Onkyo HT-RC370 Receiver to transfer the vedio to TV screen. It worked nicely for about 5 days. I did not change resolution and made any modifications , but after about one week, my receiver indicated there was no signal from my PC and the TV screen was blank blue. I rebooted my computer, the Windows logo appeared for couple of seconds on my TV screen, but turn to blank blue screen again when the PC is up running. This problem was not due to my Receiver because when I connected my PC directly with TV, the same thing happened."
3,An average rice cooker,"I purchased this rice cooker to replace my 30 year old (yes, 30) National unit. It cooks rice well enough, no better or worse than my older one but at least it has the warming feature that my older one did not have. It also works very well as a steamer. However, there are two problems with this unit that are somewhat annoying. First, there is no ""on/off"" switch, so if it is plugged in the warming function is on so you cannot just leave it sitting on the counter top, plugged in. The second issue is that in my case, water collects between the inner and outer walls of the unit (I am guessing that the ""dew collector"" on the back is overflowing) requiring that I invert the unit and shake the water out.Overall, it is not a bad unit, but in my opinion Sanyo cut a few corners in an effort to keep the price down and it results in a less than ideal appliance"
3,A good ride!,"It's now kind of old, but it was a great IMAX movie. Popped it in and it just puts you in the race car at full speed. you can feel the engine rev on every turn."
4,Banabila - VoizNoiz,"A bizarre little album that came completely out of leftfield and stayed there. Voiz Noiz is cut-up, abstract trip-hop -- if such a thing is possible. The majority of the album is composed of seemingly random vocal snippets, complemented by beats and music. The effect is jarring, but also strangely compelling. A few of the songs seem oddly freeform, without much structure; since the run times on the tracks are so short, however, the scattered nature of the songs don't outstay their welcome. ""Mono/Metro"" is probably the most traditional of the tracks, while ""Where?"" is a striking and fascinating mixture of vocals (such as they are), silence, and piano. Definitely for those who crave something different."
2,FUZZY PICTURE,I USED TO LOVE THIS SERIES WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER.SO I THOUGHT I'D ADD IT TO MY MOVIE LIBRARY. I WAS DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE PICTURE QUALITY.IT'S LIKE THEY MERELY COPIED A FUZZY VHS ONTO A DVD WITHOUT RE-MASTERING IT.
5,Garmin friction mount,I bought this mount when I bought the Garmin 255. The first time I used it - it was sitting on the dash - I had to make an emergency stop. The mount and GPS did not move! Easy to put up and take down and works equally well in the truck or car.
1,Not enough substance,I was disappointed in this book. There is not enough substance. I thought it would be a more indepth study of the weekly parsha.
1,Buy something else,"Tiny. Both the clock and the project are tiny, which would be great if I wanted to use it as a travel alarm clock.The instruction manual doesn't offer instructions on how to operate all of the functions of the clock. It does, however, include instructions for setting the time, which seems silly considering its supposed to sync automagically with the Denver atomic clock. The clock has yet to sync, which could be because you aren't supposed to touch any buttons once it has power otherwise it interrupts the sync process. Not touching a button while inserting batteries or the power cable is difficult because of the clock's design.The buttons do not depress well. Rocking the button while pressing sometimes helps it make the connection, but be careful as you might activate one of the settings menus rather than displaying the indoor temperature.Also, it's too light to make a good paper weight."
5,Hot Item!^^,I loved this item. It was exactly as discribed. The shipping was great and it came in excellent condition. If you like a good book this one is a great mistery/suspence/werewolf book that I have ever read. Once you start reading this one you can't stop until the end.
1,Customer service sucks!,"I think my following comments to Toshiba customer service say it all...""Oh, so after just 4 months of ownership, your product craps out (the product that the Toshiba touts as the most reliable, fantastic and best HD-DVD player on the market). And, as a result of this $400.00 dollar, ""high end"" device being defective, I, the consumer, have to make a trip to buy a box that fits (with such a reliable device and brand name, why would I need to keep the original box?). Then I have to buy shipping tape, take the time to package it, make another trip to the post office, wait in line for 20 minutes, then pay $18.00 to ship it? The customer has to do all of this?Your piece of s@#t device FAILED!!! Why do I have to do all of the work!!Rest assured that this will be my last Toshiba product and my comments WILL hit every electronics website that has a ""customer review"" section.Great customer service, a##holes!!!!!Have a great day!""C. Henretty"
2,Disappointed,"I bought two queen sized bags for my queen size mattress and box springs. The queen size bag barely covers the entire box spring and falls short on the mattress. It looks as if the bag would fit if the corner seams were done differently, but the seams prevent the bags from sliding on completely. Had the bags fit properly they would have been perfect. They seem very durable. My recommendation would be to buy the next size larger."
3,So So,"There is some play and it is a little difficult to use. The results are fair. For the price, it is worth a try. It might work better under different circumstances."
4,One of the great forgotten Canadian albums,"Chances are you stumbled through the musical South Pacific to finally end up here. 'Constance' rode the coatails of post-rock/orchestral soundscapes early in the decade, eg, Godspeed You Black Emperor, only to precede the likes of Broken Social Scene and Sigur Ros. South Pacific combines velvet white-noise, the techno ambience of early Aphex Twin, and breezy shoegazers Slowdive. More instrumentalists as they are musicians, one way to describe 'Constance' is atmospheric, and if you can find it, one of the brilliant albums to come from north of the border."
4,Very helpful,Not a bad resource for those trying to set up a catholic ceremony. Good sampling of readings to choose from. I'd recommend this to someone struggling for inspiration on setting up a catholic wedding.
1,"too fast to follow, not for beginners","I bought this tape, and when I tried to do it I got so frustrated. I think it's for more intermediate fitness levels, those who know the moves or something. I have done step aerobics, and love it, it's much easier to follow. This was really annoying, so much so that I threw it in the trash, only after literally pulling the tape out of the cassette!"
3,Not the best / No es el mejor,"This it is a light album, with no complications. Unfortunately, it turns out to be shallow when compared to previous 883 works, like ""La Dura Legge del Gol"" or ""La Donna, Il Sogno e Il Grande Incubo"", in which the songs go from worldly to spiritual in an almost imperceptible way. Good energy level provided by BELLA VERA and LA LUNGA ESTATE CALDISSIMA, in addition to the video files of both songs inserted in the CD. Excellent combination of Max Pezzali's voice with Syria's in ESSERE IN TE. The art is impeccable, the most novel thing being the booklet to which a shining UV layer has been applied in some areas, making it flashier. This isn't one of the best 883 albums, but still has some good things...."
4,Good but not Great.,"I got these headphones as an ""upgrade"" to my skull candy titan headphones that i have had for about a year they were still going strong but hey i was looking for a new look in my headphones. so i went with these the red roxx from V-Moda, i have to say they are really cool looking but they lack sound quality its good but it sounds a little weak especially when you are listening to a song that you know has bass its just not their. If your looking for a good quality pair of headphones i would go with the skull candy titans which here on amazon are like half the price and are pretty good sound quality and are built to last."
5,Work very effectively,"I got these ear-plugs for my husband who had ""swimmers ear"". He said with these, no water gets in his ear. And he also says he doesn't hear me talking much so he considers this a separate positive product feature, haha :)"
3,"Lenny, pretty good album","Good album, I'd actually say 3 1/2 stars. ""Minister of Rock and Roll"" and ""Sistamamalover"" are the best tunes. The music is better than the vocals. It isn't ""American Woman"" so to speak, but it is pretty decent."
5,A new twist on the classic Little Tikes Cozy Coupe Car,"My son received this from his grandmother as an early birthday gift. When he first saw it, he got a big grin on his face and climbed right in. Besides ""driving"" it around, he loves to just climbs in and out of it, open and close the door, and push the button on the ""radio"", which makes 2 different siren sounds. I often see him just sitting inside the car smiling. It is great for imaginary play!"
5,One great cookbook.,"Well known to most New England cooks, Marjorie Standish's cookbooks are a great source. Have known many a person who heads out to the freedom of their own apartment who got her books as a housewarming gift. Sometimes, more than one set. :)This cookbook is a must have for anyone who loves New England cooking. I had them when they first came out, and when I lost them during a move, made the effort here to replace them. That says a lot in itself. Marjorie's books are entertaining and well laid out. The only critique would be...why didn't see make more than she did. I only know of the two, this being the first. If you can get your hands on one, buy it. If you can get your hands on TWO, gift one to a friend. Five stars, because we can't give more stars than that. :)"
5,Excellent classic!,"This movie is one of my favorites. I describe it to people as being wonderfully Hitchcock, but it isn't actually by Hitchcock. It is the only movie that Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant ever made together, which is a shame, because they are amazing together. It's a murder mystery that takes place in Paris, and involves lots of plot twists and great dialogue. The picture quality is great- I definitely recommend this movie!"
1,Just Say No,"From the reviews, it looks like MAC users have better luck with this than Windows users. I tried to install on Windows XP and it never worked. Just say no."
5,Puzzles and more puzzles.,This made a great gift to my husband. He loves mind challenging puzzles and this one was a very great challenge for him.
1,No words can describe,"...how awful this remake is...I'm not even against remakes, really. This one is just so bad, I can't believe it made the album. Mallrats probably love it...how sad. Everyone else has covered the details. Please, buy or find a copy of Who's Next."
2,not bright,"the headlights on my 97 chevy blazer were so dim it was hard to see at night if it was raining. when i looked for replacements these sounded great. they are better quality, glass instead of plastic, and a bit brighter, but still dim. i also have an 04 mercedes and the headlights on those are incredible. i can see better on low beam in that car than the hi beam with these new sylvania. bottom line, disappointed big time."
4,The greatest revolution ever.,This book is great. Sobel uses just the right amount of detail to explain a complex set of ideas and how one man dared to challenge some of the greatest minds in man's short history. John Harrison a man with no formal schooling solved a problem that plagued sailors for centuries and he did it despite the corrupt people competing against him.
3,The Tea Rose,"The Tea Rose it a very good book, it keeps you wanting to read more, I haven't finished it yet, but am very interested in it. Usually not my type of book, but getting into it, keeps me wanting to read more."
4,To Catch a Thief,A very good film staring Cary Grant and Grace Kelly. Cary plays the part of a retired jewel thief. Someone begins to steal jewels and the local police think its Cary. Grace plays the part of the daughter of a rich Amrican widow. The film then covers how Cary Grants finds the people who have copied his MO.A fun romp through the French country side. Well acted and directed. A must see if you are a Cary Grant or Grace Kelly fan.james
5,Argh argh argh,arrived on time and was packaged in a box. No damage and it was sealed so it was obviously new.This show is awesome and i will enjoy this for a long timeI am going to find other seasons to buy and hopefully this seller has them.
3,green lantern,So-So ... I was a little surprised that The Green Lantern character was played a little too humorous and corny at times. I think it would have been a better movie had it been played straight.
2,"if not for julia r, would we watch this movie?","so you have a female enpowerment film. ok, now problem. more power to you. but this woman uses her body to get things done. wait! a contradiction. what are we telling young girls--you can be a better man by being a bad woman?sad"
1,Looks nothing like that,"They sent me some random log granted it is ""mopani"" wood my piece looked like a piece of fire wood. It was literally straight with zero curvature if it was a more expensive piece I would have def sent it straight back."
1,For Christians only!,"I want to agree with the one other reviewer who was misled by the title. I bought the book thinking it would be a well rounded factual book as the title and cover bullets described. The constant (as in practically every paragraph) references to Jesus, Christianity, and Christian values made it impossible for me to get the information I was looking for. The last straw was this statement from the book: ""I don't know about you, but something in my heart of hearts tells me it is more than coincidental that the homeschool movement has been birthed in a generation run amuck with legalized abortion. As in the time of Moses and in the time of Christ as well, the wholesale slaughter of innocence has provoked a mighty response from God."" P-LEASE! Anyway, if this statement doesn't bother you then by all means buy the book. As for me, I'm returning it right away!"
2,Not Enough Power for Our Needs,"I bought this vaccum with high expectations, as my wife uses it at the retail store she manages, and likes how it works there. For our home, however, it was a little bit underpowered. We have three large dogs and two cats. The vaccum picked up animal hair and dust well enough, but it was not strong enough to pick up kitty litter or pieces of dirt any bigger than a couple of millimeters in diameter from our laminate floors. Besides that, the vaccum charges quickly enough and has enough battery to clean several rooms. The suction is just not good enough to make our broom obsolete, so we don't use the vaccum any more."
1,Bad Movie & I was very disappointed,"When I bought this movie, I was expecting something similar to Agent Cody Banks, but instead it was Big Fat Liar and the very beginning of Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dream. The acting was bad, the casting was bad, the plot, the directing and the music was bad. Anna Sophia Robb is an excellent actress, and did a wonderful job, however, she was the only experienced and decent actress in the whole movie.I am a big fan of almost all spy books and movies, but this movie had almost no spying in it at all (don't be fooled by the title ""Spy School"").I was very disappointed with this movie, and would not recommend wasting your money on it."
1,Bad experience,"I have ordered Verizion Blackberry product on 03/19 and I got the Blackberry on 3/23. I have activated my Blackberry on 3/23, but Verizon started charging my service from 3/19 instead on 3/23. When I called Verizon, they said they cannot do anything because their system shows it is activated on 3/19. When I called Amazon, they said they cannot do anything.I won't suggest to order wireless product from Amazon because as soon as you order the charges will start before you get the wireless product.I am not happy after talking with Verizon customer service."
1,Terrible,"Used to enjoy the Scarpetta books, however this is one of the very worst books I've ever read."
2,A directionless rant.,"I know there's liberal bias in the media. At this point, who doesn't? I hoped this book would provide clear, well organized evidence. While Goldberg's work is clearly thoughtful and no doubt insightful, I found his constant sarcasm and rambling style very tiresome. While the book is full of specifics, there is little direction, and Goldberg's tone reduces his thoughtful arguments to directionless rants."
1,Book Of Lies,Mr.Camping needs to take a REAL good look to what The Bible TRULY says in Matthew 24:36.It's just a shame that alot of people lost thier money over this clown.It just goes to show you.People will believe ANYTHING and/or ANYBODY.I just heard that old man Camping is buying into the whole Mayan Dec. 21 garbage as well.Oh no.Here we go again...
5,The Body in the Library,Typical Agatha Christie. Keeps you guessing with multiple options for 'Who did it?' I would highly recommend this book to anyone that loves a good mystery.
4,cd,once again its a christmas gift. but came quick and in good shape.and im sure my girlfriend will love it!
2,"Expensive Modem, Not Worth It","Price is too high for what it offers.There's nothing extraordinary about this modem. Hardware is the same found and much more inexpensive ones.I'd say, save your money!"
4,Very Good,"Overall this is a very good CD. Lindsey uses an effect on his voice in every song which I don't think was really necessary and at times his voice will have a weak or wimpy sound to it, but it is well written and the last two songs are great. He plays his classic guitar style which is always great."
4,stalage Bayview or the human condition,"The cast of characters seem familiar, Col Klink is now Harvey Bains assisted by Sgt. Schultz in the in the form of Jane Edwards. Tom Ballard and Diana Trent are the good guys...us. Point and counter point Tom and Diana prove that opposites attract and when they do they join forces to battle evil in this world. Don't let the sometimes over done laugh track fool you, we seldom have so many deep insights into humanity posed in such small sugar coated pills. On the surface this series appears as a light comedy about old people, pure camouflage. Within the dialogue is dialogue, issues of faith vs religion, honesty tested by self interest and more. This series is well written well produced, well edited, very well directed and very well acted... WELL DONE!"
1,Didn't work; junk,"Tried it with two different disk drives. Doesn't work -- actually, doesn't appear to power on (disk doesn't spin up). I really don't appreciate being used as the manufacturer's quality control department. Avoid this one!"
3,"I tried, but I can't listen to this cd.","I tried to listen to Music by Madonna, but I was unhappy with the music. I still enjoy Madonna's earlier cds that include True Blue and Like a Virgin."
4,The illustrations are what make it,"If you can find this out-of-print, oversized hardback, it is worth collecting. The illustrators lovingly present a detailed birds-eye view of Vinci, the Sforza compound, changing designs of palaces, the scaffoldings which supported some of his bronze works, period clothing, Leonardo's proposed design for Milan and its canals, and much more. It's hard to find, but highly recommended."
5,Humbolt River,This was much more of a book than I expected. A fascinating and detailed history of this little known region. An excellent read!
3,"""Green River Gary""","With Green River Running Red, Ann Rule has done a great service not only for Ridgeway's victims, but also for the society which often regards such persons as throwaways. Replacing their numbers with their names and faces, she describes each of these women with sensitivity and compassion, reminding readers of their humanity and desperation. On the other hand, Rule treats Gary Ridgeway, who was jokingly labeled ""Green River Gary"" by co-workers after police first questioned him, with clinical objectivity. There is nothing new here: a psychologically empty man with no conscience exerts the ultimate form of power over a series of victims who are the symbols rather than the sources of his pain. Why this happens, no one yet knows. But one thing seems certain. If you encounter an individual who appears harmless yet seems a bit creepy, you'd best not get involved."
2,ANIMEIGO Transfer,"This is just a review of the technical aspect of the film. I thought the Animeigo transfer was horrible. The sound is especially horrendous as it is extremely tinny and grating. I had to almost turn the sound off to make it bearable...thank God for subtitles! The colors were good but it looked like a digital photo ""sharpened"" too many times. I prefer the previous company, Image Entertainment. Plus, you get a cool poster of the movie...:p Finally, just let me clarify that this is only for the quality of the transfer NOT the content which is the usual fun and cool Zatoichi!"
5,Confined Love,"'It was not an ordinary job...But then, Jane's employer, Paul Rouget, had seemed no ordinary man. Jane had only one thing to do-take care of Paul's small nephew (Martin) while enjoying a restful sea voyage.She never dreamed she could be part of a plot-until David Hallam, a man too disturbing for her own peace of mind, joined the cruise.Were his warnings about Paul to be heeded? Or was the real danger from David himself?"
5,great for small aggressive chewers,"My miniature dachshund can usually destroy a toy like this one in a couple of hours but this thing really lasts. I was worried about the Velcro closure but it seems to be really strong, she still has not managed to get the squeaker out. AND it comes with an extra squeaker which is a big plus in my book. Definitely worth the price. This toy is even better in real life and has a mix of textures for dogs to chew on. For example underneath the duck's ""wings"" is a sheepskin type of fabric. Fun."
5,a perfect invention,"I can't believe I went my whole life without this invention. I have moderate back hair, and it's always been impossible to remove it myself. This razor worked perfectly! You do need 2 mirrors, so you can see what you're doing. But in literally 30 seconds, all the hair was gone. It's now 3 days later, and no skin irritation at all. We'll just have to see how long it is before my back needs another trimming.I could not be happier with this, and it's the best $40 bucks I've spent in a long time. 100% satisfied."
2,Not Sexy at All,"How many times can he touch her ""there"" and how many times can she say ""no stop"". Not a great book or style of writing. Don't do it !"
1,Propaganda,"Take a minute to browse the sample pages available on this Encyclopedia. It's not your typical set of encyclopedia topics.Abolition MovementAboriginesJane Addams (Progressive)AfricaNotice a pattern? No John Adams or Samuel Adams for example. No, those founding fathers can't be too important. What's important is that our children learn as much about non-Western cultures and problems with Western culture as possible.Clearly this encyclopedia was created with an agenda. ""Scholastic"" apparently means something else these days."
3,A bit boring and predictable,It started out rather slow and tedious. The extensive details did lead to good character development. It just took too long to get to the meat of the story with numerous character introductions. Overall it was a a decent casual read just nothing exciting.
4,Impressed,"Purchased this for a Ruger .22 I purchased for my girlfriend who is trying to get into shooting. Originally I wanted the Blackhawk but soon found it wasn't available for this gun. Once I got to use it, it really worked well. Took about 10 minutes to adjust the tension screw to get it just right for draws. Would probably take less time for others because I practiced many draws. It has no slop or movement when the gun is in the holster and feels very snug. Paddle inside pants is comfortable and has no chance of being removed unwanted. This being said it can be a pain getting it out of your pants without unbuckling you belt or what have you. 4 out of 5 only because I'm die hard Blackhawk guy. Holster does exactly what it says though!!!"
5,Product works well,I have purchased these cases for years now and haven't had problems with any of them. The only time I broke one was because I stepped on it. :-)I am very please with them and will continue to purchase them.
2,ho hum...,"Ann Rice is over rated. He books are long, drawn out and boring. I found Interview with the Vampire pointless, and even the The Vampire Lestat, a premise I liked and was eager to read, was dull. If you want to read good vampire books, try the Anita Blake series"
3,It wasn't The Hills Fault...,"Although I love The Hills and am pretty much obsessed with EVERY season (except after Lauren left...)-- I had to return this boxset to the seller (textbooksrus). I was impressed with the speedy delivery, however, Disc 1 of the 3-disc set was from SEASON 3 and NOT SEASON 4, as ordered. I popped in my new DVD, expecting to see the beginning of season 4, and felt myself having an incredibly amount of Deja vu... I actually already own Season 3, and I just had this uncanny feeling that there was a mistake. So, sadly-- b/c this company doesn't do exchanges or replacements, I'll have to re-purchase this boxset from someone else. I appreciate the no-hassle refund process, but it just is a hassle to send back a partial set & wait LONGER for my COMPLETE set-- when they could just as easily send me the missing disc-1 ... *sigh* But, I'll do it in order to complete my collection."
1,Stiff and itchy,"I was incredibly disappointed with these sheets after reading the rave reviews. After two washes, they were still very stiff. Additionally, there's something in the sheets that makes me feel very itchy, which has never happened with other sheets. On the plus side, they don't wrinkle, but since they're too itchy to sleep on, the wrinkle-free quality does me no good anyway."
4,Awesome- But beware of the counter top.,"Works awesome, fairly easy to assemble. I would have put 5 stars but the counter top was cracked prior to assembly(called weber their sending a new one free of charge), and the lid handle gets a little warmer than my previous wood handle.Update: Received a new top which was also broken. They sent a 3rd which had a different tone of gray and was not broken. I would give this 5 stars if it were not for the countertop."
4,Big -Button-Best Deal,"Woke up morning at age 53 and suddenly realized I couldn't see the little buttons on my cute Pink Barbie Princess Phone. I wasn't sufferring from any any visual impairment - it was a simple case of of spending 25+ years working on computer screens and being too vain to actually wear glasses. So, what's a girl to do? Well she puts vanity aside a looks for phone with big buttons. TheNorthwestern Bell Big-Button Corded Phone Plus with 13-Number Memory (20200-1)was perfect. Good construction, easy to use,good sound quality and at less than $30.00 the price was just right!! I just wish that the phone was available in another color besides white. Powder Puff Pink or Wedgewood Bleu would be nice!"
4,The Perfect Summer Read in any Toxic Paradise,"I have read all of the Hiaasen novels since 1993 when a good friend in IRELAND first told me about ""Skin Tight"". ""Sick Puppy"", although more introvertedly humorous, still produces the occasional belly laugh. Characterizations are Hiaasen's strength with the narative being secondary. In ""Sick Puppy"" the title drives the book, a metaphor for both it's protagonist and the wealth of secondary eccentrics. LONG LIVE SKINK!"
1,amazing book,"If you love bread, want to bake it yourself and need information, this is the book for you. History, recipes and all authentic!!"
3,A little disappointing,"While this a great book for those kids who love rhyming, it is too short and there is not really a connection throughout the book. My son does not love it like other Boynton books such as the Goin to Bed Book."
4,Great less expensive choice,"My mother has chronic leg swelling ( the poor dear has cancer ) and her doctor recommended a support hose. I went to a medical supply company; they were ridiculoulsy expensive. These are the highest support without a prescription and they work great. Wide cuff mean it doesn't roll at her knee. Does require practice to get on, but are comfortable all day long. I got two pairs, one to wear and one to wash. Works great."
3,Too big in center back of neck,"The pillow is nicely constructed of quality materials, but the design puts too much foam in the crook of the neck and pushes the head too far forward and out of the comfort zone. I took a sharp serrated knife and trimmed off some of the foam. Worked fine after surgery."
1,I find this CD to be lagging..zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,This CD is a sleeper.. there is only one song that is good and that is obsession. Buy the Single and save some $$$$$.. I also don't want Amazon.com to own my review.
3,Good diet but hard to follow,"This was a good book, but it was hard to follow and lose weight because I was hungry most of the time. Also, the snack foods, lowfat cheese and nuts didn't agree with me, so that left me with fewer choices. But I do know people who have lost weight on the diet, but when they go off, they gain the weight back."
3,Got a Tear After 4 Months of Use,"We bought this for our 21 month old for Christmas and he absolutely loved it. It is big, so make sure you have the space for it. It took us awhile to blow it up, the directions weren't very clear, certian chambers needing to be filled up in a certain order, etc. After about four months we got a tear in one of the seams of the cut-outs of the walls. We are in the process of trying to repair it, but don't know how long that will last! We thought it was a great product for the price that we paid, but wish it would have lasted a lot longer. This certianly isn't a toy for an older child, we felt our son was the perfect age and size to play with the castle, between 1 1/2-3yrs. old. Hopefully our patch job will work and he and his friends will be able to enjoy it for a while longer."
4,Yu-Gi-Oh! game time.,It's a good game for those that like strategy games. It's almost like playing chess or checkers. Mainly more like chess though. Just that you have to plan ahead because each board is different in design and terrain.
1,I FINALLY GIVE UP,"I had a Drinkwell for my cats that lasted 3 years before the motor died. That's pretty good so I have no complaints. Then I bought another. Worked beautifully for 1 day and then began making a noise, kinda like something was loose inside. Was so loud that I could hear it in every room of my apartment. Could not return it because of where I got it (good price, no returns) so I figured I had a 'lemon' and should try again. Went on Amazon and saw an amazingly good price. So I bought it. I also perused the reviews and saw about a 50-50 split on the annoying noise (a rattling which drowns out the 'gentle hum'). Just got it. Plugged it in last night and was delighted that it was QUIET. Until 4am when I was awakened by a buzzing-rattling-something-is-loose-inside-here sound, just like the last one. I give up. The product is badly made. Fortunately the noise doesn't bother my cats, so I will unplug it when I go to sleep. Will never ever buy another."
4,Very useful compressor.,"I bought this compressor to inflate tires in my car. I find it very useful. It is powerful enough to quickly inflate a tire and automatic shut off by preset pressure is very convenient. Built-in light is also very helpful. Even though it is noisy, but price is very good."
5,Great for the Whole Family,"I have just finished watching this film with some friends. I must say this was an impressive and well done film. I agree with the other reviewers; acting was great, writing is excellent, everything is well timed, and it touches on many important gay issues. Let me add that the romantic scenes bewtween the leads were tastefully done and won't embarrass mom and dad. Best friend Linda is hilarious and fits right in the film. Through this film, everyone can see that it's normal to be gay, and that there's a reason those men meet in parks. It's not because they are perverted and sick. As a gay person, I could identify with pretty much every scene, the discomfort dealing with the parents, the longing for a relationship, the need to hide absolutely everything about this part of myself from the world for fear of reprisal. It's all in this wonderfully complete and well organized film. I encourage everyone, regardless of sexual orientation to see this film!"
3,"Good book, but....","Plato's Republic is a classic work, but it shouldn't be the only book you read to understand who Socrates was and what he taught. I suggest reading this book, which includes the Republic and other works about Socrates: Searching For Socrates: Ancient Texts About The Great Philosopher (Illustrated). It's also less expensive."
4,"Modern, Quirky, new-wave influenced rock","A modern mix of new-wave, punk, and ska, and early No Doubt, but updated and much cooler. There's only 1 track I don't particularly like (Too Little Too Late), but the rest are good, and the best 2 or 3 are brilliant. Stand-out tracks: Glass Ceiling (my favorite), Poster of a Girl, Monster Hospital, Live it Out."
1,Horrible sweet,"It is one of the worst sweets ever. Do not buy this product. I tried it out thinking it was going to be good, just realized its horrible. This sweet is definitely not meant for kids, just wondering who its meant for."
1,Mislead Completely!,"Expecting a collection of faux pas-foot-in-the-mouth gems, this calendar is really just a silly collection of newspaper typos....it's international in it's breadth yet mostly irritating garbage nobody really cares about. I should have spent my money ona worthy cause instead of typographical error research!"
2,Just ok,"These don't hold their shape very well, and therefore dont provide the best support. They are better than nothing, but could be better"
5,Island of Tears by Troy Soos,I found this book to be very fast paced and very interesting. It is a very good historial novel. I would recommend this book.
3,I still feel a draft,"I have these in my kids rooms, we rent & have terrible windows but it still gets rather cold in their room"
4,Quite a solid performer!,"I purchased this camera-printer set for my husband about a year ago. It's performed very nicely over the last 8 months. The only thing is that taking close-ups can be a little bit tricky and the battery life seems very short between charges. Otherwise, I would buy it again."
1,disapointed,"worked great the first time used, went to use it next day and where the charger plugs into the vacuum broke off and no suction. Very disappointed"
3,"Fast delivery, quality product (not 100% what I expected though) AAA",They delivered a high quality product very quickly. The heavy bands weren't as high resistance as I thought they would be. Overall good experience though.
1,Just awful,Pure and utter emotional masturbation on the part of the author. I was so excited to see the topic explored in print to just be that much more disappointed at its shallow translation. No insight whatsoever as to the psychological and sociological causes or effects of bullying.Unfortunately we hear story after story of children killing themselves due to bullying sometimes at the tender age of 6. I hope we eventually see a well written book that explores the topic in depth and provides some ideas for solutions.
4,good times u.s.a.,Billy has done it again with an array of other talented musicians and made Zwan!! I absolutely adore this cd and always pop it in when I need some 'feel good' music to take over. If you buy this cd you won't be sorry!
1,Blackjack For The First Century,"One usually assumes that if a person has written a book, he or she must have a modicum of knowledge about the subject being written about; but this book proves the fallacy of such an assumption. John Patrick is totally clueless concerning the mathematical probabilities which govern this game.All games that are offered by a Casino have a built-in advantage, but seldom will you find an author suggesting that you play in a way that will increase the Casino's advantage over you. This is the only thing that John Patrick does correctly. Every one of his ""special"" ideas about how to play this game are WRONG.If you play Blackjack the way he tells you to, you will not only throw away the money you spent to buy this book, you will also throw away the money you wager in a Casino using his ""special"" strategy. My only regret is that I had to choose a rating system from 1 to 5. If I could, I would have chosen -50."
4,Livid.,"A voyeuristic look into the shallow, callow amorality of people on the side of the interstate. The sex scenes still have clothes ripping, lip biting, carnal shock value--probably why it sold so well!"
1,This is Great?,"Oh My GOD!This is the Greatest work yet form Roy Williams.He has out done himself.Spell Binding, could NOT put it down.Pure freaking genius!You have to be a fool to not buy this book!Finally, The Great American Novel!Just kidding...it sucks!In Fact it sucks Big Time!"
2,"Weird Political Polemic, Not Thoughtful Consumer Commentary","This book is mostly a rapidly-becoming-dated political screed about the author's feelings about the president, conservatives, and capitalism. She spends more time flogging the Bush administration than she does exploring her own assumptions about which aspects of her own lifestyle count as ""necessary"" and which are ""luxuries"" afforded to her by the privileged place she occupies in society. Even if you share her political views, the book doesn't have much to offer, because her musings aren't particularly interesting or well-written. All in all, this book was a disappointment."
5,"Without Fail By Lee Child, Kindle Purchase Review","I have now read all the Lee Child books featuring Reacher and this one was just as good as the rest but different just like all the others. Every one of Lee Child's Reacher books are so different from each other even with the title character the same, there's no chance of you being disappointed in the storyline or the outcome. I will end up getting all the Reacher books on my Kindle once the price drops. Then I will read again.One recommendation for Amazon: Get the publishers to agree to price the Kindle books at $9.99 or less and make their profit on millions of more books sold...the higher prices sent me back to the library for the hardbacks...sad."
2,A Few Diamonds In The Rough,"Billy Idol's DEVIL'S PLAYGROUND features three of the best songs he's ever recorded--""Scream,"" ""Body Snatcher,"" and ""Summer Running."" The first two are thrilling rockers; the last is an eloquent, disarming ballad with a bomb thrown in. All three sound like natural 21st-century extensions of Idol's distinctive and spectacular ""80s sound."" Too much of the rest of DEVIL'S PLAYGROUND sounds like Green Day, and that was as surprising as it was disappointing for this fan of Idol, guitarist Steve Stevens, and drummer Brian Tichy."
2,disappointing ending,I saw this book got great reviews but thought the ending wasnt nearly as good as the rest of the book. Felt sorta like I had wasted my time-almost 500 pages to be let down at end.
5,Just finished,I totally have enjoyed the Elvis Cole novels and now with Joe Pike added they just get better and better.
5,Completely changed the way I eat.,This documentary really opened my eyes to the disgusting things that happen in the food industry. I am very careful about where I buy my food and what foods I buy. I think EVERY single American should watch this documentary.
4,Will and Grace Season 5,Really funny. Sometimes touching. The excellent cast and writers deliver great entertainment in almost every episode.
3,Good but not good enough,The book is good but it won't get you through the Foundation exam by it's self. It was weak on networking and TCP/IP and don't rely on it for the HTML section. It covered Copy Right and security well though.A good starting point but boost it with extra reading
5,Very pleases,"I just finished installing these seat covers in my son's '98 Toyota Tacoma. Exceptional fit, very hight quality material, and easy installation. They look like factory-installed seat covers."
5,Good anime,"This ova for magic knights rayearth was good. I loved the artwork and story-line was good considering it is only 3 episodes. I like that they changed the characters a bit, and what happens to each of them too. The love aspect was played up pretty good too^^ I do recommend for anime fan to buy and have in your collection. P.S. I do recommend watching season one and two first to not get confussed watching this ova."
1,The nadir of Furnier's career,This album is dire. Production is overblown and the quality of the songs is consistently poor.I think the key to this album is to drink a litre bottle of Jack Daniels & then listen to it. Only then will you truly appreciate it. I IS NOT GOODIf you see it in a record store - PUT IT BACK AND WALK AWAY
1,Leave the classics alone,"Perhaps Michael Bolton is singing these songs out of a true love for them. Or maybe he's just a leech trying to make a lot of cash.Either way, the end result is bad. The only person that can do justice to ""Georgia On My Mind"" is Ray Charles. The best version of ""When A Man Loves A Woman"" is still Percy Sledge's. And I never was a fan of ""Dock Of The Bay,"" but after hearing Bolton's version of it, the original version by Otis Redding sounds magnificent.I would imagine that some younger fans have listened to Bolton's ""Georgia On My Mind"" and have thought that he originated the song, and have never heard the true classics. And boy, that's a shame. There are some things that just should not be remade."
2,hh,"Vendor was prompt and professional.Item was clean and good value.Stultifying, slow moving, could not finish this tome.Not the Faulks that I know and love."
5,Great Item,I got this today and I love it! It's perfect for what I need - to switch between my headset for Skype (and other voice-chats) and my computer speakers. I don't detect any noise or hiss. Works exactly as it should. And it's a GREAT DEAL.
1,What A Waste!,I bought 2 of these fans @ $7 each. The water leaks out!! My daughter used hers for about 10 minutes and the fan quit working. The on/off button on my sons broke after the 3rd time he turned it off. Don't waste your money.
5,Great chocks,I bought these for my RV and they work just great. I thought at first they might move with the trailer but they stay put. I would recommend rubber chocks.
3,Not a convertible mini!,The product I received was the Mini Co-sleeper...NOT the convertible mini! The product description is misleading.Here is the link to Arm's Reach Mini:[...]Here is the link for the CONVERTIBLE Arm's Reach Mini:[...]They are not the same!
5,Unbelievable First Outting!!,"This introductory full-length release shows Royksopp are fresh, sleak innovators in a saturated electronica market. Easily among the best albums of late. The first dish, ""So Easy"" sends the listeners audio nerves to a post-modern soundscape, while the second outting, ""Epie"" gives the album it's first taste of an Alice in Wonderland feel with its schizophrenic keyboard toggling. Vocal tracks like ""Poor Lido"" lend rainy day lyrics to upbeat rhythms. Melody AM is an absolute must for serious listeners of electronica. This is NOT another gay-friendly- dance-club album at all. It has much more of a coffee shop vibe. Royskopp have raised the bar for electronica in much the same way Massive Attack raised the bar for Trip Hop."
4,Great for the price,The case on these is pretty crappy and the first thing I had to do was glue the magnetic strips to the case so everything didn't fall out. I also had to run duct tape along the hinge side within a week. That being said the handles and blades in this set are fine so if you can handle the crappy case you get a lot for your money.
5,My music collection did'nt seem complete without it.,"I have always loved Smokey! Partially because I grew from childhood to adulthood with his music. It's funny, though, sometimes as we grow we take for granted all the greatness around us--the music, the people and places. Somehow we just think they'll aways be there, till they're not. And one day you hear Smokey sing one of his jams! All of a sudden it all comes back--the people, the places--good or bad, it doesn't matter. And you realize Smokey was there living it all with you.My personal favorite is ""The Love I Saw In You Was Just a Mirage"". Maybe because I once identified with it. Or maybe just because he sounds so sweet. Another personal favorite is ""Swept For You Baby"" found on another CD. Classic Smokey! Anyway, as one of the last of the ""Baby Boomers"" my music collection didn't seem complete without it."
3,"Great, but not that great","Another reviewer said they sounded like a second rate autechre...which is a very true statement. Don't get me wrong, the first four tracks are worth the price of the cd alone, but the rest doesn't follow. The first four tracks are quite memorable and incredible. The rest of the cd is rather forgettable though."
4,Solid piece of steel,I have several 1x8 tpi chucks and faceplates from my old lathe. This adapter has allowed me to continue to use them all. My alternative would have been to buy new faceplaces and adapters for each of my chucks.This is an excellent solution. The only downside is you loose about 2in between centers.
3,Ordinary staples- a little over priced,"You can buy these same staples a lot cheaper at Home Depo. Good product, not a real value when bought here."
1,Battery Issues,"I have had this DVD player for about 13 months and have had no issues until the battery completely stopped charging. The moment I pull out the power cord, the DVD player completely stops. This pretty much ruins the purpose of having a portable DVD player. I called Toshiba and was told tht I would have to pay for an repairs. This battery issue seems to be a common problem with this player. If you get one without this issue, it's a pretty good player."
2,Limited = Bubble head box,"I love the simpsons, and I've been waiting a while to get this but the description of the product didn't mention that the limited eddition is that stupid bubble head plastic stuff. When I saw what I got I was really bumbed out. Then I noticed that there is a Blu-Ray version. Heck yeah I'm gonna get the blue-ray version so I can watch it on my new TV.Limited eddition = bubble head boxBox set = standard DVD with standard boxBlue-ray = standard box, just in Blue-ray format"
4,Great Software!,"This software is so easy to use. It doesn't have ALL of the uses that some software has but for the small time photo nut, this is perfect. It has a great array of frames. Very useful."
3,Drummer saves this band,"If it were'nt for drummer Roy McDonald, this band would be another bad punk/pop band. They are a bad punk/pop band, but the drummer is soooo much fun to watch."
5,Aerosmith Rocks!!!!!!!!,"Aerosmith is the best band of all time! They could rip it up in the 70's, 80's, and can still do it now. They have some of the best guitar riffs, and this album shows it so well. Steven Tyler is awesome(even if he is ancient). Again this album is awesome, SO BUY IT!"
2,Poor quality not in line with price.,"The materials are OK, the glass top looks great.The welds on the product were done with all the care and precision of your average junior high metal shop student.The screws are of such low quality that a very small person can strip the heads using only a hand held screw driver. (NOT power tools)Cheap quality plastic drawer fronts and very weak drawer bottoms. Only time will tell if they will hold up."
3,good amateur effort,it's okay; the author relies a lot on exclamation marks to try to create a sense of excitement. Chris Cocks is still the one to read.
1,Poor package quality conditions,"Unfortunately, for the first time I must rate negatively a product purchased from Amazon LLC. The inner package came completely damaged (actually torn and the liquid was leaking). It is unacceptable."
3,Very Good writing; Lack of citations,"The value of the book's content is expounded on numerous times in other posts; however, my biggest problem with the book is there are absolutely no endnotes or footnotes. While I recognize this book is popularly written, it contains numerous quotations and interesting facts but NONE of them are cited. The back of the book contains a ""Bibliography"" that says ""here follows a highly selective list of resources that are available for general readership..."" The utter lacking of citation really hurt my impression of a very well written book. In the end, good book, but don't count on double-checking anything very easily."
1,Hard to get the games out!,The plastic sleeves are very tight and impossible for my son to get the games out. We had to cut some of the pockets to get them out. Nice case - just hard to use. We ended up taking out the plastic sleeves and just let the games roam free in there now...
2,Too delicate for frequent use :(,"Earmuffs have a nice feel and appearance, so that's a plus. They were a gift to an adult, so they weren't abused by someone who didn't know how to handle them, but nevertheless the connecting band broke within 2 weeks of first use. They were given early in December, and were in the trash by Christmas."
3,An OK Book; Would Have Been Better If Read in 1996,"Andrew Grove does a really nice job of presenting the story of Intel and others in the context of his 'strategic inflection point' idea. I thought the book was well-written, insightful, and engaging.I started to get a little bored in the second half of the book though. In all fairness, the book was written 16 years before I read it. That is, it would have been really good (five stars) if I had read it then. Sixteen years later, I still found it to be worth reading -- but the stars start to fade over time."
3,"Not his best, but I'll keep reading John Sanford...","Too many characters and a convoluted plot make this one of the hardest of the ""Prey"" series to get through. Don't get me wrong - I sailed through the book in a couple of hours, but here's the problem -- you don't really care about any particular character, even if you CAN keep them all straight. And he pulls an Agatha Christie at the end -- introducing someone you've never heard from before, and pinning the crime on them. We all know that Sanford can do better - hopefully the next Prey book will live up to his potential..."
3,"Disappointed, but Happy because...","I got this for Christmas, and returned it immediately because of a faulty speaker (buzzed). I wasn't all that pleased with the sound or the AM/FM reception either. The only things going for it were the aesthetics and the alarm clock features.Frankly, I wanted performance, and I didn't need an alarm clock. If you want good AM/FM reception, a dedicated iPod docking port, and very good sound, then do what I did - get the TEAC GR-10i. Not only does the audio sound clear without any buzzing or static, it also has deep bass. I'd say the TEAC is as good as the $300 units out there, but at 1/2 to 1/3 the cost. However, it's not really an alarm clock - it doesn't even have a snooze button. Another warning is its size - it's 1/3 larger than the iHome. But it does come with a sturdy little remote."
2,this was a disapointing book,Dear Mr. Henshaw was a disapointing book because a lot of the questions I had about the book were not answered.
4,GOOD EFFECTS !!!,"THIS MOVIE SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN AT LEAST 3 1/2 STARS.THE EFFECTS ARE REALLY GOOD.IF YOU LIKE SCI-FI MOVIES THEN THIS MOVIE IS FOR YOU.FOR TRAVOLTA FANS THIS MOVIE IS FOR YOU AS WELL,JOHN TRAVOLTA LOOKS REALLY COOL.I THOUGHT HE'D NEVER BE IN A MOVIE WITH THAT KIND OF CHARACTER.THIS IS A REALLY GOOD FLICK MAYBE IT COULD OF BEEN BETTER BUT THIS MOVIE GOT 4 STARS OUT OF ME.BUY THIS MOVIE IT'S A CLASSIC SCI-FI.HOW MUCH GOLD DOES ""FORT KNOX"" REALLY HAVE !!!"
1,UGH!,I hated this movie. I have never seen anything as bad! The acting sucked and so did the music. This movie was just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with!
4,Solid package,"After using the keyboard extensively, I can't say anything bad about it...it's a solid performer with no quirks or hassles. The mouse is a bit on the basic side, but for the price the two combined is not a bad deal at all.If you can afford to put down a little more cash, I would recommend the same keyboard with a Wireless Explorer mouse or even better the Logitech Freedom Pro Optical keyboard/mouse combo."
3,"three and a half stars, amazon. THREE AND A HALF","cd compilation of two previous lps of galt macdermot's more minor releases (he composed Hair, apparently), which while it may not be a long lost classic unearthed is worth hearing. my only real qualm with this is in between some pretty nice tracks like ripped open by metal explosions and lost dreams, you get utterly bizarre inclusions like a radio ad for skin balm(?) and some real monkey-organ-grinder sounding stuff. a little programming here and there though, and you've got yourself a significantly shorter but pretty funky little disc."
1,the picture on the box is better than the animation.,"mischief makers?what does make you think of?teenagers who get bored and break stuff?firecrackers?practical jokes?pranks?how about............none of the above.how about some crap that looks like it belongs on the original atari?no mischief,just a very poorly animated and quite bright super mario bros rip off.save your money a buy a box a paper clips.youll have more fun."
2,"uhh, wait hold on... it's not that great...","there's about three good songs on the album. that's it. the rest just doesn't do it. at least not like Endtroducing by DJ Shadow did.HIGHLY overrated. good formula but bad sound. this is a good example of the ""great white hope"" thing going on in rap today."
1,"5 stars for the series, 1 star for the cover","The series is, of course, wonderful. Who wouldn't like a fiesty REDHEAD who finds her places in the world of PEI? The cover of the series is a travesty and whomever ok'd it should be fired as they are clearly very bad at their job."
1,Extremely Lame,"This 4 page document had nothing but vague generalties: ""Employee Morale falls when many positions are unfilled"", ""Managers must reassure and motivate employees in down times.""The advice was largely vague and useless: ""Develop an open-door policy"" , ""Make the workplace as pleasant and stress-free as possible.""I'd continue giving a couple of more examples, but then I'd be giving the whole thing away.A rip-off for three dollars. But even more distressing was the time I took ordering it."
5,10 Stars!!!,"No review will do this book justice. I would give this novel 10 stars if I could. I haven't read a book that has kept me up until 2am in years. Then came along Tatia and Shura. Paullina Simons puts you in Tatiana's body and makes you feel what she feels.. her love, her pain, the conflict. It is a beautiful story."
2,Don't waste your money,"This DVD shows basic stretching excercises for sitting, standing and laying down. What this video shows can be retrieved by a Google search on 'stretching' for free. Though yoga incorporates stretching methods into yogo routines, (to me) this DVD is not yoga. I've taken yoga classes before and they were much more robust than this DVD. The DVD spends little time on breathing techniques, which is a big part of yoga. Save your money and do the Google search..."
1,Analog Display,"The display is essentially analog. I was hoping that the primary display was digital, hence, I have returned it, otherwise it looks like a reliable time piece."
4,Good introduction to subject,"Interesting introduction to the Palestinians own perceptions of their occupation and diaspora. Also a good window into a literary tradition very different from that of the West - and therefore it can sometimes be hard for Western readers to fully understand some of the cultural and literary allusions. Subjects are often approached very indirectly. Unsurprisingly, stories are bleak, raw and sad at times. They're also very personal, and a good counter-balance to the usually very politicized accounts of the situation in the media."
3,DVD not so gr8!,"I love this movie which is why I ordered it but, the DVD skips quite a bit while playing and some scenes have been cut from the original."
1,Subscribe & Save - Last Minute Price Increase,"On a ""Subscribe & Save"" automatic reorder, the product price was increased after the ""Your Subscription Order Will Ship Soon"" notification but before the ""Your Subscribe & Save Shipment Has Been Processed"" notification. This doesn't give the buyer any chance to skip the shipment or cancel the subscription if they don't like the price increase."
1,Small watchband,I was surprised to find out how small the watchband was when it arrived in the mail. I don't have a large wrist at all and it just fits.
5,Goodfellas=Realism.,"In 1990, I remember sitting in the theatre before 'Goodfellas' started and expecting nothing. Afterward, my friend and I looked at each other with a mutual surprised expression -- ""That was a great movie"" . Scorcese is an incredible storyteller and, 'Goodfellas', like 'The Sopranos', has received such critical acclaim b/c of the believability of the characters and the creative way it is presented. A lot of the dialogue in the film was adlibbed by the actors, more realism. Excellent film."
2,Misadvertising,"The EN-EL3a is a works fine and with no problems. HOWEVER, AMAZON IS MISLEADING ITS CUSTOMERS BY PUTTING A LOWER PRICE FROM A PARTNER COMPANY AS THE PRIMARY PRICE OF THE ITEM. Amazon should market the item at it's price and show the partner price as an option unless the item can only be obtained from the partner. The 2 stars is not for the item but for amazon's misleading advertisment."
3,The Brothers Warner,"I have always enjoyed going to the movies. In recent years my interest in learning more about movie making, knowing about the directors, and the history of the studios. Because I had seen the documentary on the TV, when I saw Amazon's price, I didn't hesitate to purchase it. If you are a movie buff, you will want to add this one to your collection."
4,One exception ...,"Love popcorn. Any popcorn. Tasted my daughter's made with a 6-Cup West Bend Stir-Crazy and fell in LOVE with the wonderful taste and easy preparation. Don't know if her's does it, but mine will catch a kernal or 3 beneath the middle turn knob and when it pops, it will not come out unless the entire stir arm is unskrewed and lifted to release the popped kernals. This is irksome to have to do after each batch of popcorn.Otherwise, it works great."
1,High price for a cheap looking watch,I have ordered this watch for my friend and when he received it he was disappointed for the following reasons:1. Too small for men. Good for children only.2. The weight was very light as if it is nothing.3. Generally looks very cheep.4. The price is very high for this watch.5. The lock is also bad.The design is the only thing I liked.
5,The best book ever!,"It was super book that i just could NOT put down. Great for all Lucy fans young and old. Recounts her life correctly just as she saw it. Be prepared to stay up all night reading it, though."
2,Stones Only Weak Album in 35 Years,"It just goes to show that you should always be yourself. The one time they try to copy another band-The Beatles-they fail miserably (to be fare, Beatles can't do what the Stones do either.) But even with their weakest effort, they came away with two classics I never get tired of; ""2,000 Light Years"" and ""She's a Rainbow."" These songs alone still make it worth purchasing, smoking & drinking to."
4,noce,"This small dictionary is packed full of the idioms,and 21st century words. I like it a lot. I would recommend it."
3,Dry vs. wet,I purchased this product for an emergency incubating an abandoned duck egg. It is terrible! I had two sleepless nights listening to the readings until I switched it out with my aquarium thermometer. It works great in the tank...and I am relieved to say my duckling made it through the fluctuations.
1,not enough info,"I wish more info, or a rating, had been given this music CD. I threw it in the garbage after receiving it due to the vulgar language. I would not listen to it in the presence of my two young sons, nor do I enjoy hearing that kind of language myself."
2,GOOD BEGINNER WORKOUT,"THIS IS A VERY EASY TAPE TO FOLLOW THAT IS NOT CHALLENGING TO THE BODY. I HAVE HAD THE TAPE FOR OVER A YEAR AND FIND MYSELF VERY BORED WITH IT SIMPLY BECAUSE IT IS NOT CHALLENGING. FROM THE GET GO, I HAVE USED 5-10LBS MORE WEIGHT THAN INSTUCTOR FOR EACH EXERCISE AND STILL DO NOT FEEL LIKE I AM GETTING A WORK OUT. I WOULD RECOMMEND FOR SOMEONE JUST STARTING OUT OR SOMEONE WHO HAS NOT DONE MUCH WEIGHT TRAINING BEFORE."
3,"Not bad, not great; good deal for the price","The fit works well, which was my main concern. But the sound is not great. The highs are muted. It is not a crisp sound. The price is so low, you can't really lose."
1,worst book i've ever read!,"This was probably the worst book i have ever read. it's shockingly bad. in fact, it is the only book i have ever thrown away after reading. The only value this book brought me is that it at least took me in the mindset of a man who lived before i was born and i enjoyed some of the old terminology that was used. But i can pretty much sum up every chapter for you as: i ran into a peasant today and he told me he saw a fairy once...end of chapter. none of the stories build on each other and they are all short with not much meaning behind them. Don't waste your hard earn money on this book. I understand WB Yeates to be one of the greatest writers of the 20th century, but i was not impressed. I will continue to search for a good book to read about Irish myths and folklore, but i highly recommend for those new and interested in Norse mythology to read: Children of Odin by Padriac Colum."
5,Excellent product,I have been using a smaller George Foreman grill for a couple of years but wanted one with removable plates for easier cleaning.This new grille works very well and is very convenient to clean since the plates can be removed and placed in the dish washer.I am very satisfied with the productWesley
1,BOMB!!!!!!!!!!,"...need I say anymore? Not worth a penny. If someone offers it to you at no cost, tell them to donate it to charity and get the write-off for one cent!"
1,"An uninformed, unhelpful book","This book, which has somehow been sent all over the world in the form of desk copies (I received 2!), was not written by a storyteller, and its contents indicate that, though the author had done some research, it was all in his office. It lacks any sense of practical application to the real teller of tales. It seems methodical and logical, but ultimately, the information is not based on practical research or practice. There are several excellent books on storytelling. This book, written by a freelance author, can only be seen as a book which seeks to capitalize on the currrent growing popularity of the art form. It is not helpful to the would-be storyteller. It is even less helpful to intermediate or advanced tellers. Save your money and purchase something that is worthwhile."
2,Disappointment to me,"Had previously owned Broadway cast version on LP. Compared to that recording, songs on this one have less life and exhuberance, or are overproduced. If Amazon posted samples of ""Hair"", ""Where Do I Go"" or ""I Got Life"" or some others, you could hear the overproduction (more chorus and orchestra, less spirit from the singer). I bought this CD because of the great reviews on Amazon for this version and accusations of bad production quality for the Broadway cast version CD. This one also has a lot of non-musical dialog, which hurts the musical flow. I played this one once and haven't played it since. I'll go get the version I grew up with."
3,Lacking the Poetic,"I have a website for introverts, [...] and get thousands of emails from infps all over the world. I would say this is a pretty accurant description, maybe not quite modest or poetic enough! A true infp would probably be using a lot of metaphors to create a beautiful image or feeling of what they experienced."
3,good but no clasic,"Let me atart off by sying that i have been listening to rap for almost 20 plus years and personaly feel The Infamous"" & ""Hell On Earth"" theese were thier best works this cd is cool if you are a true die hard G Unit groopie, but us true hip hop heads will find this album as dry as a desert in Summer half the beats sound amature, and half the rymes sound like they recyled them from other cats song books, but my younger cousins, they think classic rap is Eminem lol, are feeling it so I give it 3 stars."
1,This mini wireless optical mouse is very ugly,This mini wireless optical mouse is very ugly. Right now this Mini Wireless Optical Mouse is not working. I just bought this wireless last month but now is not working anymore.
1,will not fit,I have a Hitachi vm-h100la camera and the battery pictured here will not fit. It does not look like the battery in my camera.
1,HORRIBLE TUB!,"I received this tub at my baby shower along with the infant shower. The tub is a complete waste of money. No matter what I do, it leaks and I have to end up filling the tub up again in the middle of bathing my daughter. It's so frustrating. I just use the cloth seat that came with it and put it directly in the bath tub to bathe her now. What's the purpose of a 2 piece tub that you have to put together and leaks profusely??"
4,Door handle,"Exactly what was needed, fit truck door perfectly. No problems at all. Will use company again for car parts or if some other factory part needs replacement."
4,It's Just A Lil Infectious,"When this album first came out, I didn't really care for it outside of a few tracks. But, upon a second listen a few months later due in fact that ""Just a Lil Bit"" is becoming the jam of the summer, I discovered this a hot album. The radio singles ""Candy Shop"" ""Just a Lil Bit"" and ""Disco Inferno"" do exatcly what they are intended to do, be hot club bangers, and they might be the hottest club songs of the year. The street stuff is very good too like ""This is 50"", ""Gunz Come out"" and ""Ski Mask Way"". These tracks are hard, but not too hard that casual hip hop fans wouldn't listen to them. 50 has made an album in true chameleon fashion, that it pleases virtually every facet of hip hop."
4,I think I like this book more than my son does right now.,"This is a wonderful book for any little train lover. However, the subtle correlations between the ""bedroom"" train and the ""country"" train are lost on my 3 year old right now. I love how Brown mirrors the toy train set-up in the household with the real train travelling through the countryside on the opposite page. The artwork is lovely, and the story is clear and simple. It's a nice, calming book, perfect for the end of the day."
4,Good song,I like how rappers dedicate songs to their deceased loved ones because it shows that they have a heart and they're not really the bad people that others make them out to be. I didn't really like Big Pun that much but I understand what a great loss he was to his friends and family. Check this out!
2,Not a high quality product...,"I've owned 2 Calvin Klein belts and 1 wallet, and all have broke on me. I didn't do anything out of the ordinary, they just broke due to poor quality. I will stay away from CK accessory products from now on.This wallet started out really tight, with all the pockets (3) barely fitting one card each, and the money clip was so tight I could only fit maybe 3-4 bills. After a few months, it loosened a bit. And after a few more months, it loosened so much that the clip broke, making it useless. The metal clip is just a horrible design and CK needs to discontinue it."
5,Very Good,The quality of the case is excellent and I would expect to have paid much more. Its padded and large enough to fit a tactical rifle with accessories. I was expecting something cheaper. Will see how it holds up in the rear of the pickup and at the range. For the $ its a deal.
5,Entertaining!!!!,What can you say about Harry and his friends that haven't been said!!!! Enjoyed the whole series of films and are sad to see them done. At least Voldemort was taken care of!!!!
2,You really can't cast Peter Lawford,"as a straight Peter Lawford. He was as gay in 1945 as he is here, lo those many years later. He's certainly not the sort of lothario/protagonist that could ever set any woman's wheels in motion.Davis, after ""Baby Jane"" and ""Hush, Hush"" looks, deservedly so, exhausted. Like she doesn't even want to be a part of this mess, though she gives it her best shot. She's a mess, he's a mess, everyones a mess mess. But here they are, throwing the mess in our faces and, as far as Davis is concerned, down our throat.For Davis, it's not a bad turn. She's okay. She rises above the decidely Grade B material with aplomb. Her twin sister act, while not convincing, is enjoyable to watch.But an exhausted Bette Davis has a tendency to exhaust the viewer. Toss in Peter Lawford and it bcomes a defintion of ""yawn"". He can't act and she's trying her best, at this stage of the game. TWICE!!!!!!!!!!!! She's twins, you know.Silly fare, but for Davis fans, well, it's Davis."
5,LCD TV cleaner,Product arrived next day and works as advertised. Cleaned TV screen without leaving any streaks.
2,I love and hate this machine.,"I love and hate this machine. My first two scarves turned out great which was exciting because I am not a knitter. I tried several different types of yarns (in case some were too thick for machine) for a 3rd scarf but the machine crank kept clicking and having issues even with the thin yarns. Like the other reviews, I believe the plastic design just wasn't created to last long. I wish this was a more durable machine because I really enjoyed it when it worked....very bummed it is no longer working after 2 scarves."
4,Fine Kindle edition,"First of all, the Kindle listings for Oman's books on medieval warfare are a bit of a muddle, and the conversions vary widely in quality, so make sure you are getting what you pay for. Oman published a short ""Art of War in the Middle Ages: AD 378-1515"" in 1885. This was followed in 1898 by the much fuller ""A History of the Art of War: The Middle Ages from the Fourth to the Fourteenth Century."" Finally, in 1924 this second book was revised and reprinted as the first volume of ""A History of the Art of War in the Middle Ages.""The Tales End Press edition, ASIN B007DQ0VW6, represents the 1898 book and is excellent value for money. It includes the entire text, footnotes, and diagrams, and has evidently been prepared with great care. Highly recommended for students of military history. I subtract a star only because the scholarship of the last century has inevitably revised some of Oman's views."
3,Samson myth,"Very scholarly, but too repetitive. I thought applying psychological motives a bit over the top. I expected it to be more like the CanonGate myths series. In short, more than I wanted to know."
1,Piece of junk,The worst thing I've ever bought. It started smoking on one of our trips we were afraid it was ruined but it still works . The brightness control is messed up and the volume doesn't work either.Do not buy or you will regret it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Terrible headset,The headset supposedly works at 24 feet away. We could not get it to work even 6 ft away from the base. Even with the 6ft distance there was a hissing noise. Im going to return this product
2,NO Progress In 20 years!,I've owned a product like this for ever...20-30 years...After all these years with all the new technology you would expect these people to put on a hi-intensity LED light to assist the viewing...instead you have the same horrible week flashlight bulb that is all but useless...in any well lite room...People it's 2010...put a light on this thing....It's not 1953...AGGH!!!
4,Interesting Account of Biracial Americans,"I really enjoyed this book. It is an intriguing look at the lives of people who have one African heritage and one European heritage parent, and how they fit into the traditional American concepts of ""black"" and ""white."" The book features interviews with people both young and old and examines their attitudes towards race, community, interracial relationships, culture, and more. An excellent read for anyone interested in this subject"
4,The Sacred Review,"This book is excellent---more gripping than Mrs. Kellerman's first book in the series, ""The Ritual Bath."" The novel further delves into the lives of Rina and her sons while Decker is out trying to solve a multiple murder case in the porn film industy. I was disappointed in the scene when Rina and Decker consummate their love for the first time. First, it totally doesn't fit Rina's character to show up at Peter's house saying, ""I want to sleep with you."" Also, I feel like if they were going to do it, then the scene and the one following it should have been more dramatic. Kellerman missed an opportunity to write a beautiful scene and comment on Decker's feelings afterward. Withstanding that, this book is really excellent! Read it!"
5,Awesome trays,I use these trays to store purée baby food in. They are a little stiff once frozen which makes it difficult to get cubes out but I just leave the tray out for a minute and then twist to release cubes. The lids don't snap on but they gift well enough to keep the food from getting frosty.
2,Legion of yawns.,"This CD is definitely TCM's most uninspired work. There isn't too much by way of originality in the songs, too many tunes with vocal accompaniment, and all together kind of boring. Guest guitarist WES BORLAND (formerly of LIMP BISCUIT) is way underused, especially on the second to best track: WEAPONS OF MASS DISTORTION. Halfway into the tune you think it's going to kick into something full blown cool and never does. The highlight track is ACETONE, and is a reminder that CRYSTAL METHOD still has chops. However that certainly is not appearant on the rest of this album. Weak entry, especially after the inventive COMMUNITY SERVICE, and the do-all/say-all of techno recordings-VEGAS."
2,Not too impressed,"Used a couple of times. Needs excess pressure to chop anything but eggs. Get yourself a good sharp 8"" chefs knife, much faster after you spend the time to clean this contraption."
5,Could not put it down!,I bought the book before we went on vacation and was glad I did. I Pretty much read non-stop for two days until I finished late the second night. Definitely kept my interest and kept me on the edge of my seat. I was actually sad that I finished the book. Stephen King is bright and witty and it comes through in his work. Great job!
3,like detective series,"Like the series, but I think its a little slow going. More action would be good. Perhaps because its a bit dated now."
2,soul calibur sucks!!,"Let me start by saying that I am not a kid I am 14. First of all this is just like Mortal Cimbat but with swords and it some manages to cheat more. For exmple, in Weapons Master you will fight the same person expert they have a huge advantages like they come in groups of three or sometimes five. Cheating! Now in my strong opion you should be able to set the difficulty of Weapons Mode because eventaully your oppent beomes to sissy by blocking a WHOLE lot. And then there buying stuff. the weapons you get 90% of the are useless no wait lower than that. And the cost for a new outfit is insane. The cost for that is at least the of 4 weapons. You think a new outfit makes your character stronger but it doesn't. So unless you are on crack get this game."
5,Lots of discs are a very good thing...,As a person who has used lots of writable CD and DVD products I would highly recommend this product. I have yet to have any problems of any kind while using this product. If your storage needs are under 650 + megabytes I would buy this product. Note : This product needs several Megabytes of room for formatting and does not hold exactly 700 Merabytes of your data. For the price listed this ad it is a great deal as well...
2,assembly is difficult,"I have had this for a week and can't put it together. I usually put furniture together by myself, so thought I could do it here too, but no. It came with no instructions and I don't want to send it back b/c it is so big and such a hassle - but I might have to."
3,Might work,Might work if there was something strong to tie to--with broken strainer it requires different tool. Not a replacement for skills of good plumber and his tools
3,But Why is There Still a Scene cut from Raiders?,"Good to have the series on DVD, but I was disappointed, appalled actually, that a scene in Raiders that was cut from the video was also cut on the dvd. In the cinema release of Raiders, immediately AFTER the credits, there was a cutaway to the boxed Ark of the Covenant in the US Govt warehouse, and the U.S. Govt brand on the box is gradually being burnt away by the Ark. The implication (as I read it) was that the Ark no more wanted to be held by the U.S. govt than held by the Nazis. But check your dvd's, folks, it ain't there no more. Which is a subtle but disturbing little piece of censorship."
5,My puppy lkoves it.,"I bought the moo cow and our puppy loves this one too, along with the frog we bought her. She just loves them both and will be buying more for her to enjoy."
1,Terrible design,"Got this as a wedding present and after one use, the hinge stopped working. It's supposed to have a subtle mechanism that locks when closed, but opens when the hendle is pulled.But the design is poor and after one use, the iron wouldn't open unless a knife is used to pry it open.Also, there is non-heating material on only part of the handle. I burned by hand on the burning hot metal of the handle, which is easy to do when handling it.So one of the poorest designs I've seen on a consumer product in many years."
3,Quick Reference,The book is just what it advertised. It's a good quick reference book with a few explanations.
3,Tips over too easily,"Tough to pull your little one and turn corners in this sled... it tips over every time no matter how slow you go. You really have to make wide turns to avoid this. And, yes, the cord is too short even for me and I am only 5'2"". My poor 6'2"" husband gets a backache every time he has to pull it around.Also... what gives with this new $70 price tag???? I think we got this thing for less than $12 a year ago. Silly."
5,let papa sleep,This is the book I remember most from my childhood my sister read it to me probably on a daily basis and I remember it fondly. I've read it to my daughter and now she reads it to me. What a great book.
1,Worst Trimmer Ever!!,"This trimmer is horrible....it took me about 45 minutes just to get an even shave. If you have a really short beard then I suppose it will work fine for you. But if you have a beard around level 3 or higher, be prepared to stand there for at least half an hour trying to get an even shave."
5,Great Value,"I bought this cable because it was offered when I bought my Wall Mount and thought ""why not, must be better than composite"".When I connected it, it was a huge difference in the quality of my Blue Ray DVD player.The construction is great, I recommend it."
1,Bad clamp,"I got this clamp to use as a straight edge with a saw but it does not clamp into place worth a darn. It's not worth much more than a paper weight. As soon as you push up ageist it, it will move."
4,Not as good as 'Crush' but still solid,"I finally bought the CD to replace my old vinyl copy from 1986. Amazon was the only place I could find a brand new copy. The album is very melodic and a pure classic from OMD's late releases, but not as strong as the album 'Crush' from 1985. Its to bad Paul left the group after this one. Every song fits neatly into one another. Very well put together songs. Best songs are 'Forever live and Die', 'Shame', 'Goddess of Love', and 'Watch us Fall'. ***Highly recommended***"
3,exposing the house-husband myth,"Inside information on the last 5 years of John Lennon's life from the perspective of Yoko Ono's tarot card reader. The years that John referred to as his househusband period, was actually a time of lethargy, apathy, & songwriter's block. The Lennons employed too many servants-including a nanny- to necessitate a househusband.Green documents John's descent into depression, sometimes bordering on psychosis, culminating in a 15-month period of self-imposed solitude in his Dakota apartment bedroom. Yoko copes with John's hermeticism by throwing herself into the business of making money for the family by acting as John's Apple representative, and through a number of unusual investments-including organic farming and the purchase of an ancient sarcophagus."
1,How can they call it the soundtrack?,Once again I hear a song in a movie and go to listen to a sample and find out the name from the sound track listing and it isn't on it.
2,Shock,"I am an avid reader of Robin Cook, but I've never felt like I've wasted so much time in my life with reading this book. I couldn't put it down, yet when I got to the end I was flabbergasted! How can you just stop a book without an ending??? I'm not sure I'll read any more of his books."
1,Not a good NonStick Omelette Pan,"With nonstick pans, you should not spray oil on the surface b/c it could leave a residue, and isn't this why you bought a nonstick pan in the first place, so you could cook without the oil?This pan was not able to cook an egg on its non-stick surface. I used a little PAM and no problems, but I guess that's why the good non-stick costs more."
4,Upgrading from FrontPage to Expression Web,"Expression Web is a great product that competes very favorably with professional web design tools such as Dream WeaverHowever, FrontPage up-graders need to be aware that web component wizards, form designer or like conveniences are gone in Expression WebFrontPage users should expect a significant learning curve if they are not familiar with designing cascading style sheets (CSS), creating web databases and the like. Plan to use FrontPage for your published sites until your skill sets have been upgraded too."
2,disappointment,"I am a big Cameron Diaz fan, but this was really a disappointment. It was slow and hard to follow, I kept waiting for something bid to happen and that never happened. It was a very ""dark"" movie. The review looked good and I couldn't wait to watch it, I am glad I didn't go to the show to see it."
4,Spoken Word Royalty,"Anyone who has read my reviews in regards to Lydia's body of work can tell that I have a love/hate/obsessive reaction to her artistic cartharsis. This particular piece Memory and Madness is pretty good, not as great as Rude Hieroglyphics or Oral Fixation. Yet this is still way better than her music and books. Lydia Lunch's genius and talent is in her spoken word. She will always reign supreme to anyone and everyone who attempts at this particular type of artistic expression."
2,Not cotton,I didn't notice that the sweatshirt was a cotton/polyester blend. My husband wears only 100% cotton because the blend is too hot and does't breathe well.
1,Awful,"007 Nightfire.... When I bought Nightfire I thought WOW! this game is going to be a blast! I beat the game on operative the day I got it. I thought to myself okay, minor setback, I'll try 00 agent. Beat it the next day. I think this game deserves a one star. I have to admit, it has good graphics, but the A.I. is laughable, and the game has very low replayability. Get a good game like GOLDENEYE 007 or Halo. Those rock! I mean come on guys, a Mexican guy takes over a space station that has 8 nukes! What? Why does Bond go? Just blast the stupid thing. Another thing, the MP5K is only in burst! It is supposed to be full auto. When you shoot the bad guys its just like shooting concrete. No blood either. Don't buy Nightfire! If anyone agrees with me, email me at Cheeze2go@aol.com"
1,Rat zapper zaps nothing,"I bought this product due to other customer reviews stating that within hours your pests would be caught. I've had the rat zapper for over a month now and have not caught one mouse - and yes, we do have mice! Ended up using poisonous bait after all and have been watching the bait disappear. Don't spend your money on this!"
3,Early Junior is worth hearing,"Having become a Junior Vasquez addict (following him from the Tunnel to Arena to Twilo), I found that I could not rest without having everything by him in print. I was surprised to discover this little gem, full of songs the DJ wrote himself. It is generally agreed that Live Vol. 2 is his best work, and nothing in this collection is likely to change that assessment for anyone. But there are a number of tunes here that make the cd worth the list price -- among them ""Just Like a Queen"" and ""Cum on U Can Git It."" A few of these tunes also lean toward ambient, so those looking for the fully blown tracks of his legendary nightclub sets will get only about half of what they want. The vocals are also kept to a bare minimum here."
5,Great,"This book was really great. It made you think of things that you would normally never think of. Although some of the histories of philosophy could get a little boring, other more interesting parts make up for them."
2,Misleading Features,"I agree with the extensively written review ""An Expensive Disappointment."" You cannot put liquids in this unit, not even small amounts. One would assume liquids are OK since the device has a ""liquid fill line,"" but customer service confirms that the device is not designed for liquids. The lid fits over the outside of the bowl and leaks a huge amount once the blade throws the liquid up against the sides of the bowl. I originally liked the 3-bowl design, but the blades only fit the large and small bowls. The instructions tell you that the middle sized bowl is for slicing discs only. I tried making mayo and ended up with a puddle of oil in the center near the blade. The same problem happens with any food, ending up with chunks hiding near the blade in the center. Not very well designed device."
4,Good inexpensive watch,I've had the watch for about two months now and it works fine. I just wish the buttons protruded from the watch body about half as far as they currently do. I believe that would prevent the mode from being accidently changed so often. That said I would buy it again.
4,very scary,this book is extremely scary and the suspense of waiting for something to happen is great i couldnt put it down he reads with the suspense of stephen king and is very similar to dean koontz but hes a bit more graphic in his depictions
3,"A must for Karloff fans, a curiosity for everyone else","Something Weird Video scores another mini-triumph (after Monsters Crash the Pajama Party) with this rare and strange collection. If you're a fan of Boris Karloff, there's no question you must have this 2-disc set. Karloff is not only the host, but appears in most of the episodes. Comparisons to The Twilight Zone are inevitable; but the tone of the show more closely resembles Alfred Hitchcock Presents. The quality of the scripts and acting varies wildly, making the series a mixed bag. On the technical side, the picture looks crisp and clean, and the audio is acceptable for a mono recording. A special bonus: 2 episodes of the equally obscure 13 DEMON STREET, hosted by a haggard Lon Chaney Jr. Personally, I hope SWV will go ahead and release the full Chaney series. Overally, an impressive presentation of a Lost Not-Quite-Classic."
4,a decent book that takes a little time to get used to,"I bought this for a college class. The way it is divided into ""lessons"" is different from what I was used to. The projects on the CD helped me learn this program. Taking the time to read the material then use the CD in the back to do the projects is worth it! Halfway through the class the different style of this book started to click and I have used it since then many times as a reference. I would recommend it to any beginner that has little experience with computer design or computer art like I was at the time I took the class.As for the other reviews on Amazon on the other ""Adobe ... revealed"" books, they are rather confusing because it seems like some people posted reviews on the wrong book. It seems there is more than one edition for some of the ""revealed"" books, (some in color, some black and white, some include a CD, some don't.) So be careful you buy what you really are looking for."
1,Meh....,"This game altough it looks great, its gets boring very fast, i got bored of the so called arcades, and versus and everthing, its just not my type of game, you fight and fight and just get enough $ for sunglasses, no story at all.Good: GraphicsBad: Boring, no story, no online, gets very repetitive."
5,Fun Monkey,"Fun for all ages above 6. Actually, if it were up to me I'd make it fun for ages 10 and up, because younger kids could easily hurt themselves or others with it. I love the monkey, don't get me wrong. They just need to keep it out of young kids hands."
5,History of Women in America,The book was in fine shape as advertised and came in a timely manner Thanks.
1,"oh, the album cover is the worst","Whats with the album cover? At least make them look like they are carved into the tree or something. looks like it was made with Photoshop 0.5. Terrible, represents the music perfectly."
5,"New wet shaving convert, love this razor",I switched to wet shaving about a month ago and picked up this razor. I've been very happy with it:-good amount of weight so you don't have to apply pressure to cut through the hair.-comfortable grip.-easy to change blades.
3,Good Book with Good Contents,"This is my first book for the data modeling.1. This book has the wonderful format as it has no much concept reading. Most are dealing directly with how to do and why. 2. This has wonderful example, although it is simple. 3. It does not give me much experienced info about the denormalization."
1,This CD Is Overated!!!,"I thought this CD would be one of Brian's best work but I was wrong. All of his songs sounds the same. Back @ One is a carbon copy of ""Anytime"". Sadness... =( I'm really disappointed with you Brian, I thought you would come out with a bang but this CD was a BIG DUD!!! Sorry to all of the B. McKnight fans but I'm just keepin'it real. So I would suggest to save your money and wait for it on the discount rack.Aloha..."
1,GodAwful,"How can the people above give this 4 stars? There is one song on it ""T-Bone"" where he repeats the same lines over and over. That ain't song writng. Never see Bob Dylan write something like that. You know it stinks becasue I've never seen Neil play any of the songs from this album live."
3,"OK, but not worth the price","I suppose it does what it's supposed to, but the smell is awful. Also, it tends to make my hair feel dry and wiry. I have thick, course hair to begin with, so it may produce better results in hair that is finer mine."
4,Good Item,This item works very well and I am happy with the performance. I would recomend to others.
3,Comfortable gloves but latex coating leaves sulfur smell on hands,"CUT RESISTANT GLOVES-100% KEVLAR, Heavy Weight Textured Blue Latex Coated,large, (1 pair) (Tools & Home Improvement)Gloves fit well and comfortably, but after removing had sulfur smell on hands that did not wash off easily"
4,"Good, but not great","I liked the movie overall. It didn't have the same FEEL like the first one did, and i wish the characters were more tied together to those in the first (only recurring character is one of the Frogg Brothers.) Definitely keeping it and watching it again."
3,go go go shotgun,"well, good ol zinny j zan is back with a bang, 2nd cd by swedish glamztres led by ex shotgun messiah man, the cd kicks of good, makes a kinda slow turn and losing speed. to be honest, the cd is good buy not great!"
5,Presence of Greatness,"Know how it is when you purchase a CD but whenever you play it you program only a couple of favorite cuts? This is not one of those; every song is wonderfully phrased, cleanly executed. It is a pleasure to spin the whole thing. Other reviewers have commented on their favorites in this Christy collection and I am really surprised that nobody has mentioned ""Intrigue"" - classic Christy voice and a classic Rugolo accompaniment."
2,I can't see what everyone else is raving about!,"I was suprised to see this on the list of ""raves"" here at Amazon.com. I found it especially odd to find some reviews comparing it with Ender's Game (one of my favorites). I can hardly think of two sci-fi books more different.I will say that the writing was quite good. That is why I decided to complete the book, but I was looking forward to getting to the end. Then when I reached the end and realized that this was only the first of a series I felt cheated. I knew I wouldn't read the second, but had absolutely no sense of resolution."
1,Cocalo Sugar Plum Hamper,"I took some time to look for the best price on this item and thought it would look cute in my daughter's room, even though her entire bedding set was from Bombay. I was extremely surprised with the poor quality of this item, the wood isn't very sturdy and appears cheap as compared to my son's hamper that I bought about 5 years ago at Marshall's. I paid 36.00 and I am extremely disappointed. I guess if you truly are just buying it for a baby's room and don't plan on using it long term, you should be okay. But, check your local retailers first as they might have better quality hammpers for almost 1/2 the price..."
1,Misinformation,"Sad to see so many glowing reviews of this book. Depressing to realize how readily misinformation is accepted as fact with the reviewers thoughtlessly indulging in the spread of misinformation themselves. If you must read this book make sure you also read Ranulph Fiennes' ""Captain Scott""."
4,Transformers--The Movie,This is a Christmas gift for our grandson. We were pleased with the shipping time and assume it will be a good buy as all our other Amazon buys have been.
3,"Dated, but interesting from a historical perspective","Dated content, but interesting for historical perspective of religion comparisons. Mostly 'western' religion comparison. For free, so nothing to complain about."
5,"A beautiful edition,at last, the pictures and life together!","For the first time we can see the story of Coco Chanel's life and the style it inspired side by side, in an elegantly produced, reasonably priced volume. Chanel called herself the first 20th century woman, and the fact that the way women dress today is due to her understanding of women, her independence and her fascinating life unfolds in Janet Wallach's narrative. Surely this is the least expensive Chanel one can buy and keep forever."
2,Lasted for 2 years,All company claims are a lie. After 2 years it takes long time to boil 10 cups of water; Heating element DOES NOT resists mineral buildup; Filter DOES NOT keep mineral flakes out of cup; filter falls out of the kettle; Safety system DOES NOT prevent splashing. Good to use for a year or two.
3,"Great equipment, wrong color",I bought this one in particular 'cause I thought it was silver... But it is green... It just think they should be more carefull with the pictures... Overall this is the best caliper for measuments of fat. Very precise..
5,THESE GOGGLES SOLVED MY PROBLEM!,Got these in polarized brown lenses. I'm petite and these goggles fit great.Reason I bought them is to protect my face from extremely windy conditions up here in the Oklahoma country prairies while I run in the winter time. Protection offered by the lenses is awesome for glare and visibility is still great at the end of day or during gloomy days. The way you adjust the straps by sliding the 2 buckles closer or farther apart is very handy as well. Goggles are lightweight enough to run in them and don't fog up.
3,Indigo Controller,"The controller got to me quickly, however, it wasn't purple it was black. I'm glad to have it either way, and gamecube is a great gaming system, but I ordered an indigo controller. It's really annoying that I didn't get what I paid for."
1,ASLVidReveiw,This was not the item I expected to receive. I am highly disappointed. I was expecting to receive like the title said.
5,WENDY.CHYNNA.CARNIE,"Well this ladies had it goin on again, although many people has stated that they don't understand this version of GO YOUR OWN WAY, I could, This clever ladies, said!, well if were gonna make a acover of Fleetwood Mac, well, to not disrespect the original, let's do a completely different version, and they did, a version were the tracks are slow and with a lot of harmony. For me they have in their hands a really deep version not in a point of comparison with the original, but this is so delightful to hear....it's really heartbreakin', Carnie, Chynna and Wendy are heading to a great album, but with the slow infution RADIO has given to this track, let's hope SONY don't give up on this project and promote a second single cos there's a lot of material in CALIFORNIA, this track it's superb!"
1,Doesn't Work,"This is a really bad Paul Simon album (I never thought I could even think those words). It is by far his worst, so far below anything he has ever released. I recently went on the net and read a few interviews with Paul Simon. All of them referred to how Paul is a craftsman, takes great care with his work, and won't release anything that he is not proud of. In light of his comments over the years I am frankly surprised that this is even out there. I have just about everything that Simon has released and I like everything except You're The One. The songs are unmemorable, the lyrics are often forced and awkward. After I recently had a renewed interest in Paul's music I went back and listened to this cd again, thinking perhaps I was too hard on it. I could barely get through one listen. If you are considering getting this you would do much better to instead buy any of Paul Simon's other works."
4,Making Augustine a Human Being,"I read Brown's book as part of a raft of books on theology and Christian history during my studies. Most of the books are dreadful, or just mildly interesting. This book stands out of the crowd. I felt like I knew Augustine, or at least understood his character and times, after reading this book. It seems I am in good company in thinking of this as a classic."
3,"I love the movies. Only problem is when I got them, the inside that would hole them all together was broken into pieces","I love the movies. Only problem is when I got them, the inside that would hole them all together was broken into pieces. Not too happy"
2,Not the Stans of old.,"I would rate these a lot higher if I could wear them. I used to wear Stans all the time, when a pair would wear out, I would go to the store and pick up another pair, size 11 1/2. I didn't have to try them on, just buy them and go. Beware of doing that with these. I got 11 1/2 and they run narrow, the length is ok, but they are narrow, and squeeze my feet. I could wear them, and they might break in, and stretch, but I would bet they would also blow out in short order where the upper connects to the sole.I have tried to contact the sell Midwest Sports, to get the issue resolved, but the email came back, and when I contacted the website, it didn't get answered. This is a buyer beware situation. The look good, but I don't want to look good and feel terrible. I would not buy these online, go to an old brick and mortar store, and try them on."
1,Bad role modeling,"I received this book as a gift for my son. I right away liked the illustrations and the fact that it rhymed, but a couple of passages in the text were bad enough for me throw it out.Books that encourage little children dislike any animal, in this case snakes, rats, bats, bees, and even gnats and fleas, should never get published. Or veggies: I am glad my son likes peas, but why teach him that peas are something to dislike?Instead of teaching children cliches about nasty children who pull hair, call you names, spoil games, draw on walls etc., the authors should be a bit more thoughtful and explain why some children do things that are wrong. Who has not wished to let him/herself go and draw on walls? Does this make one a nasty child? Sadly the author seems to think so.One star for the art, but cross out the text and make up your own. Or throw it out, but don't pass it on to other children. No one should be reading this."
5,A Thinker's Book,"My advice is simple: Try this book. Its a one-hour read. However, don't undertake this task while your brain is relaxing. Those that don't take something away from this book are either unfocused or require that a book meet the ""weight test"" to measure up. Don't allow yourself to be fooled.Sure, this book's ""story"" is about 4 rodents, a maze and their quest for cheese. But the concept is much, much deeper. Personally and professionally, the concept rings true. Those looking for the easy path, the ""tried-and-true"" path, the concrete path, will never reach new heights. The book's parable leads the reader through the maze that is life, again, your personal or professional life.I'll not go any further with the concept or the story as I believe each reader should experience the book and decide unilaterally. A warning: be prepared to THINK and focus on the concept. You'll not be disappointed."
1,I would so give this a 5 Star Review only for the fact that this is not the Imported Reissue that Amazon says it is.,"I ordered this CD via through Amazon thinking that it was the reissue with the Bonus Track of 25 or 6 to 4.As it states in the information reguarding this CD. BUYER BEWARE!!! Athough this is the reissue of Vince Neils Carved in Stone, It does not have this song as a bonus track, There for it nothing but a regular reissue of the same CD that was released in 1995 on Beyond Music and not Warner Bros. Other then this little misguided information I would Definatly give this release a 5 Star rating."
5,Great fun to play with other couples!!!,We have so much fun playing with one or two other couples. You definitely need more than two people to make it more fun.Also fun to play with the grandchildren as they catch on pretty fast!Have Fun!
1,Calorie Blastting Dance...really?!,"When I saw that the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders had Calorie Blasting Dance video I was thrilled. I'm your averaged sized 27 year old woman who works out about 4-5 days a week and I love a good dance exercise video. I was seriously disappointed. After 15 minutes I turned it off. I hadn't even broken a sweat...and I break a sweat caring laundry up and down my stairs at home. I probably burned more calories getting ready to workout. It was THAT bad. The ""dance"" moves are not physically challenging. The cheerleaders are annoying. I'm sorry to say it, but I wouldn't recommend this video."
4,Worth to pay,"If you are pixel graphic lover, this is a must have pixel book !The book come with pixel music. There are 16 nice tracks in the cd, which remind me of famicom ""nintendo"" game console.The pixel art inside the book are nicely done. If u like eboy book and u feel not enough, this is the next pixel book for u."
1,Very Disappointing,"The product was delivered quickly and was well packaged, to be fair. I plugged it in for charging and, after a full day, it still couldn't completely remove a cork from a wine bottle (it made about three revolutions before dying). I plugged it in again for another day and still had no luck with trying to open the wine bottle. I contacted Amazon and they immediately issued a refund and sent me a label for returning the item. I purchased the opener, in part, based on the brand name. Based on the disappointing experience with this particular opener, I wasn't inclined to get a replacement and opted for the refund."
5,LOVE IT,"If you are just getting into Age of Empires, this game is great for starters! This is how I started. And I have loved it ever since! :D I love the third better though and hope they come out with a fourth soon!"
2,NOT SATISFIED!,"I was not happy with this buyer at all. He only gives you seven days to return a product. He does not guarantee the products. The product does not work in all three speeds, only in one and of course i did not find this out right away so my seven days were GONE!!!I would not purchase another thing from this buyer!!!"
4,Excellent Product,"We bought the 42"" crate for our black lab. He weighs about 100 lbs and had far outgrown his previous crate that was only 34"". We decided to get this crate because of the price and because of the option side or front doors. It feels very durable. The pull out tray liner is really nice as well. We would highly recommend this crate to anyone."
3,Not a real medical thriller,"In the midst of an malpractice lawsuit, the Center for Fertility and Enhancement, Dr. Tim Sullivan is in a car accident. Business partner Dr. Ben McKay, also an ordained minister, comes to the house to console Marnie Sullivan. Soon, the two of them begin a relationship. Later a bomb destroys the lab and almost kills one of the partners, Dr. Luc Morgan. Slowly, Marnie and Ben piece together what Tim was working on and they realize that everyone connected to the clinic is in danger."
3,"Too Much Humour, Too Little Action","The blurb says: ""When the bodyguard's employer is assassinated, the grieving son fires him. By inheriting his father's company, the son now becomes the next target and is forced to flee and hide out with a family who is unaware of his connections. Seeking redemption, the boduguard determines to find and protect the missing son. However, a gang of bumbling hit men thwart his efforts"". COMMENT: As a rule, I hate humour coupled with action. The episodes about mentally ill people are really awful. I bought this movie hoping to see Tony Jaa, which I have enjoyed very much from ""Ong Bak"", and ""The Protector"". However, there is very little Tony Jaa in this movie (20 minutes at the most and he appeared by the end of the movie). In due respect to Tony Jaa, I am happy to give this movie 3 stars."
1,Don't waste your time or money on this movie.,"I bought this video as a joke. However, the joke was on me when I was forced to watch it with the recipient. Unfortunately, this movie was NOT what I expected it to be. In another aspect, IT WAS WORSE. Not only does the movie steal from other movies, but its choppy, inconsistent in its scenes, and all together BAD. If I was in a movie theater I would have demanded a refund, and some TUMS, for the sour feeling in my stomach."
3,As expected,"Just wanted to try out my new Creative vision. Cops would look even more stupid if it weren't for how stupid criminals usually seem to be. Amazon's unbox service worked well, and I guess this episode is worth a few laughs...."
5,I don't know what all the fuss is?,"Every one of the critics reviewed this game as OK, and I don't see why. I like it a lot! I'm a big fan of games like Commandos, Warcraft, Roller Coaster Tycoon, etc. And I definitely think Sudden Strike fits with those. You really have to think about strategy when attacking enemies. You can't just send all your men and steam roll 'em! You have to use some flanking tactics and sneaking up to win. And RECON, RECON, RECON! Also, taking the time to train your men really pays off. The only thing I found odd was that a tank couldn't run over a soldier. They have to shoot them to kill them. Also, I would like to be able to zoom in to see my troops and tanks better. Other than that, I think anyone who likes an addictive ""high-clicking"" game will love this. But beware, it is a ""Time Sucker!"""
4,"OK, not life shattering","I was excited to get this book, but found it slightly dissapointing. It was nice that the author is honest and admits to needing to get away from her kids and that they can drive her crazy at times. Most moms these days will not admit to that. The book did not really tell me anything I had not learned already from other parenting books. But all in all it was a good read."
5,BEST BOOK ON BOXING,"I fought in the pros for 8 years and in the amateurs for 6 and this is the best book on boxing I have ever read.I give it to my friends as a present for birthdays, graduations and retirements"
3,He said that he loves this gift.,I bought this DVD for a friend and he said that he really did love it. I think that he has watched it twice so far.
5,A novel noteworthy of praise,"CHASTITY INNOCENCE UNLEASHED is truly one of the best novels I reviewed. As a book reviewer of many fiction novels, I've read a lot of the best-selling fiction and none of it is better than this book. The characters are so vivid and real that the book is truly alive. Anyone who hasn''t read this novel is missing out on one of the greatest novels ever written. Sincerely, Devan"
2,"Lacking something overall, not as good as the Sookie books","I read this after loving all of the Sookie Stackhouse books and hating the Harper (Grave Sight et al) character and books. I was hoping to find a middle ground here that would have some of the same humor and finesse of Sookie's stories without the melodrama and creepy relationships of the Harper stories. Sadly, this book and Aurora left me cold. Real Murders felt like a book for teens. Aurora is lacking confidence, she has no panache and none of the real world intelligence that makes Sookie so real and a character you actually want to know more about."
1,All this over a couple pounds,"I exercised and dieted while taking this product. During the first month I lost a couple pounds; thereafter, I lost not an ounce more. Disappointing!"
2,Worked fine for a while,"Worked fine for about a year, then just started acting funny, made lots of noises (technical speak for us not techies). Luckily I backed it up to the hard drive (we had been using it as a shared drive). Now back to the drawing board. Maybe a different manufacturer this time."
2,The Tea Rose,"I read & really enjoyed Northern Lights so I thought I'd try The Tea Rose, too. Big mistake! Huge mistake! I still have trouble believing this is the same author. The book couldn't have been more trite with co-incidences abounding. I'm still mad at myself for wasting my time and finishing it."
2,Weak on repairs and textures,"Great if you want to hang your own drywall but I'm working as a handyman. All of my work is repairs and patches, was hoping to get more efficient repair techniques and tips for finishes. Both seem to be after thoughts."
3,"very neat, boke easy","I had gotten this a number of years ago, fun color, functional, wish it lasted more than a month. The part that holds the knife in place does not hold it in place anymore opens in pocket...has been in a drawer ever since, I think it is under warranty but I dont know how to go about doing that."
1,not as pictured,Although the product will work it is not what I thought I was getting. I believe it is a copy of the original. Then end is stright and not at an angle as shown in the picture. I was disappointed with my purchase.
4,They work for my cat,"I didn't give this 5 stars as I've only had it a couple of weeks maybe. But even though they are big my 7 lb girl goes for the whole thing to bite it although 1/2 goes on the floor but she cleans that up. She is a 2 year old I just got 2 months ago and the vet said her teeth had plague build up so I'm hoping these help, she's not the type to let me brush her teeth, although I have wanted to buy those dental wipes to use along with these. My girl has a small mouth and she handles these so I think if the cat likes them enough they will bite through to get the benefit. Ultimately it would be better if they were a little smaller, and I also give her some greenies so I hope it helps."
5,Best one yet!,"Ok this game is abit old - even the reviews are old - but i seen it here and wanted to post my opinion. This game - came with my inital order of my PS2 - spent almost half-a-grand on stuff for my PS2 (the system was 300dollars then, games were bout 55, memory was bout 50 too) and i initially bought this game to say i had it. And i played it and became another statistic on the Final Fantasy Fans List. I loved this game i was absorbed by it in no time. Great graphics, and the story line is excellent. If your thinking about buyin this game, by all means do it. its great. Has Challenge - good plot, good characters/voices, good graphics. excellent game."
2,Recommendation: read Riley's own account,"King has taken two first-hand accounts of this 1815 ship wreck story -- Robbin's journal (1817)and Riley's well-known Sufferings in Africa (1817)--and combined them into his own day-by-day account of this survival adventure. And, although his book is nicely written, it adds little to the record. Riley's book was in its time read by over a million readers. It was a favorite of Abe Lincoln. It appeared in numerous editions from 1817 through the Civil War years. It was, and, is called ""one of the best adventure books ever written,"" and is now available in a paperback edition of 316 pages (published in 2000)by Lyons Press. With 195,000 books published last year, in my opinion, King's rehash is one we could have done without. If you want authenticy, immediacy and the real story; read Riley's own first-hand account not this on-looker's composited version."
2,Comes up short,"In the pantheon of Southern rock, including bands like Lynyrd Skynyrd, The Allman Brothers Band, Bad Co., and many others, Kid Rock does not compare. His song, ``Sweet Home Alabama's'' most identifiable hook is a sample of Warren Zevon's intro to ``Werevolves of London.'' Kid Rock's song is intended as a paean to Skynyrd's song of the same name. But it is repetitive and trite. Skynyrd's song took a controversial stand, defending George Wallace, the segregationist governor of Alabama in the 60's, from Neil Young criticism in his song ``Southern Man.'' In comparison, Kid Rock's song is essentially bubble gum music for wanna be rednecks (like him). Zevon also has a song, ``Play it All Night Long,'' which is tangentially about Skynyrd's, ``Sweet Home,'' and far better than Mr. Rock's. Young, Skynyrd and Zevon may have had political differences, but their music at least rocked. In comparison, Kid Rock sucks."
4,Great romance,"This has been one of my old favorites - a sweet, touching romance between two folks who are cousins (by marriage). It's fun to watch Ted Danson and Isabella Rosselini play tricks on their spouses, who are cheating on them. You can believe the romance that is developing as they move from being friends to much more. A great, overlooked, romantic comedy."
1,Nobody even knows that this is actually out!!!,"Well, seems like we have another washed-up Nu-Metal band that is still trying to hold on to whatever money they have left because they know that it's not 2000 anymore. Anyway, this is just horrible. Adema should all be assissnated be trying, and failing horrednously, to cover an Alice In Chains shong. Funny thing is that no-one even knows this E.P. is out!"
5,The Thirst!,After the Tribe I wasn't sure if this was going to be a good movie or not but they brought frog back and it really turned my head! I LOVE this movie!
1,Dissapointed doesn't describe it,"We bought this unit a couple of weeks ago expecting a product that would make good coffee.It does not make good coffee. The coffee comes out too strong but lacking in robust flavor. How do they do this? I'm not sure; I use the same coffee from the same grinder with the same water in my Braun Flavor Select and get excellent coffee - full flavor and good extraction. I tried using more beans but just got stronger coffee without more flavor. I also messed with the 'small pot' control and got slightly improved coffee but still nothing like what I expect.Functionally the unit has some problems, as well. It is difficult to empty the carafe completely; the little rubber feet come out when I slide the thing across the counter and the level indicator is hard to see.Poor use of money, materials and energy."
2,Needs Work,"This game, while including some very nice expansions on the original Airline Tycoon, had some major bugs in it.For starters, parts of the text in the game were in German. Particularly the news-stand articles. Also, part of the airport announcements were done in German, and English. The copy of the game I had was supposed to be the US release version, so there should have been 0 German text to begin with.Furthermore, the planes that the player could build weren't painted in the livery of the player's airline. They were left in unpainted metal. Furthermore, the design elements were limited, and some not very attractive. It gave the aircraft a cartoonish look.Overall, I'm disappointed with Airline Tycoon: Evolution. If you ask me, it was more of a De-evolution."
4,True Love,"I got this book from: bloggingforbooks.Everyone wishes to be loved forever and ever. Every little girl dreams to meet her knight in shining armor or is waiting for a prince charming to sweep her off to his castle. As the bride goes down to meet the groom at the end of the red carpet, friends and family are writing their story down. As we go through life, we oftentimes make our lists and expect God to generate our boyfriends into our liking. God has already made the perfect guy for our lives and He's just waiting to give him to you in His own timing.In this riveting novel that I could not put down, it drew me to the theme of the book. It is talking about how Trevin laying down his life to win the heart of the princess. In this case, it is the prince charming that is trying to win a girl's heart.This book is even better than the Sword and the Eye."
4,Radiohead's family tree,Yeah I said it! Read my actual review on the 1990 release page. Love how cutting edge this is.
2,There is nothing wrong with Tracie's voice..,but this album did not do anything for me. All the songs sounded alike to me.
3,Good all around CD,"This is a good compilation of famous baritone arias, nevertheless the renditions are not as good as the package itself. If you want to know what a baritone sings is Ok, specially for the price but if you want to really hear and enjoy a baritone voice interpreting the arias, forget about it. Maybe you'll be better off purchasing the Ramey-Hampson CD ""No Tenors Allowed""."
1,Sentimental tripe,"This is sentimental tripe -- a yuppie's nostalgia for a pre-gentrified city. As for the Amazon.com reviewer who prefers this rubbish to the amazing Ric Burns series or to anything by Studs Turkel -- all I can say is, buddy, you're not a real New Yorker."
3,e la solita storia..,"L'Arlesiana still has some good stuff to bring to us, and the most important one is the famous tenor aria, e la solita storia (lamento di Federico) , which is perhaps one of the most amazing tenor arias ever written.In this version, I think Peter Kelen doesn't do a bad job, he's not the best but he is pleasant to hear in a big part of the opera. He sounds quite sure in the top of his register and is not bad technically, not impressive though.About THE aria, I must say that Kelen sings it fine. I would recomend versions by BENIAMINO GIGLI, Tito Shipa, Giussepe di Stefano and I think Alfredo Kraus sang it quite well too.That's all I'll write for the moment.Bye!"
5,Citizens Band,"I Remember when this was first on Tv I was in to CB Radios I Love the Movie and Today I Still Love to watch it I Still use CB Radio and Monitor CB Channel-9 for Emergencys Iam a REACT Member and CB Radio Hear in Shelby,NC is Still Hopping I Miss the Good Old Days. REACT is Still Around and Going Good and it is 49 Years Old and All Over The Wrold We been in Shelby 16 Years. Take Care God Bless to all."
2,Heels wore out in 4 months,"Fit was excellent. Uppers look nice and leather is good. Laces were a tad too long. My dad wore these for 4 months. He is almost 78 so he doesn't run anything into the ground these days but the heels of the shoes did not hold up. They have those hollow pockets in them so they are not solid, long-lasting material. He wore a pair of SAS shoes for 2 years before we decided to retire them..... The Camerons looked like a good match to the SAS shoe- style-wise but forwear, they did not compare. I got a replacement pair- customer service was good enough to offer that-- but I will never buy another pair. If you wear them inside 90% of the time on carpet, you'd probably be just fine with these shoes."
3,another English learning ref.,"My opinion, this one is not as good as ""Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary, 3rd"". However, having two dictionary at the same time can help you to understand more."
3,Very touching movie,"First of all, I thought everyone gave an outstanding performance -- Especially Michael Clarke (Duncan) and Tom (Hanks). Their performances were the most moving in my opinion. I was REALLY amazed by John's (Michael Clarke Duncan) faith healing power. The only thing I was scared of was some of the violence -- Especially Percy's (Doug Hutchison) violent ways. Other than that, I enjoyed the movie. In conclusion, THE GREEN MILE was a very touching movie. If you haven't seen it, go out there, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it."
4,good recording,I looked around quite a bit and read reviews before buying this version. I'm satisfied with it. I think it's well done.
1,A waste of trees and money,"This handbook did not teach me anything i already didn't know. Morry Sofer frankly is an unreliable source when it comes to translating. For a book made up predominantly of appendices, there is no real valuable or vital information the reader can attain for his 25 dollars. In all honesty...Not worth a single penny."
3,lent everywhere,i would have been just as well off to have just put a stocking over the vent tubing and let it blow inside. this thing doesnt do a very good job of catching any lint you would be better off with a unit like i have seen before that you can flip a damper for summer to let it vent outside. i will put some kind of filter in this to catch the excess lint
3,it is a cute song,The song is so cute i totally support the young singers they are trying to do their best. Lil'Reema is so cute in it.
2,Impossible to finish the book,"For 313 pages I thought this was a great book. All the code worked and there were no problems at all. Then in the 18th chanpter, after entering code to save a PRODUCT I started to get errors. None of the book code from the CD for subsequent chapters works either and there is no errata for this book on the book website and no way to contact the author. While I did learn something in the first 313 pages I consider the whole experience a waste of time since it is IMPOSSIBLE TO FINISH THE BOOK OR COMPLETE THE APLLICATION."
1,Garbage,I should have listened to the other reviews. These things are pure junk. Thin plastic and two of the 4 lights did not even work. Way to go Brinkmann. Chinese garbage!!!
4,Great book,The bible of massage therapy! I really hope it would help me with OSCE's.The condition of the book was 4/5 though
1,Not what I expected,"My dad had knee surgery recently, and we were joking that his epitaph would have to include the fact that he now has a part from a cadaver. I wanted to get him a book of FUNNY epitaphs, and this one is full of the overblown poetry about the nature of death. Which is fine, if that's what you're looking for, but I wanted something different."
2,"Good classic recipes, BUT...","I've already encountered a huge problem with this cookbook. Obviously, many of the dessert recipes, if not almost all of them, call for Betty Crocker mixes many of which are no longer available! Apparently, they just reprinted this book without taking the time to update the recipes. As a result, there are going to be a ton of recipes you can't make. I know I could probably find ways to make other mixes work, but I bought a cookbook to tell me how to make food, not so that I can experiment. This book will be going back."
3,Much more theoretical than practical,"This book reads like a doctoral thesis. The neural network theory presented is quite complete, if difficult to wade through. Having ""practical"" in its title, I expected far better examples on the accompanying disk. However, the source code came with no make files and no sample data. Many syntax errors quickly became apparent when I tried to incorporate the code into a project (unmatched parentheses, use of undeclared variables, etc.). Once I fixed those, bugs in the code began to surface, such as closing the output file after calling ""return"" and other serious bugs. It is clear that the code has never been actually tested. To summarize, if you already know something about neural networks and want to get deeper into the theory and formulas, this may be the book for you. But it certainly will NOT get you started writing an NN application without considerable effort and additional research."
5,De-Evolution In Audio,"Oh, those spudboys. They know how to piss off an audience. It's pefect for this to be in reverse chronological order, as we see the beginnings of chaos in Devo's famous 1977 performance at Max's Kansas City that sent 'em into the big time. Then we time warp to a show where Devo nearly gets into a fist fight after only a few songs. Poor spuds couldn't figure out what they were listening to!The last part of the album, however, is the beautiful part. 1974, Devo's first gig. As the audience cowers, Devo verbally rapes them with constant shouts of ""Are we not men?"" Diving into the wonderfully vulgar ""I Need A Chick"" they are only stopped when the power is cut. Turning up your volume high-as-it-will-go and you'll hear Mark, Gerry and some of the local spuds almost kill each other.Oh, yes, indeed. Devo Live: The Mongoloid years is well deserving of 5 stars, even with its tape hiss and 4 track sound. It's a testament to De-evolution.DUTY NOW FOR THE FUTURE!"
5,Very cool...gotta get it,"If you're a Spice fan, you simply must get this great book. It's got tons of pictures, and great behind the scenes stuff. The best part is the diary that Geri wrote the whole time they were filming. PS: I miss Geri a lot and I wish she hadn't left. :("
1,Don't buy,"My husband gave me this blender for Christmas. The glass part never fit well into the base and I had to hold it down while blending. The other day I made a smoothie and took a sip and realized it was full of small black plastic bits! The ring had broken and was demolished into my drink. So 80 bucks for 4 months use, what a piece of junk."
4,Great Product!,"Works like magic on the bikini zone! Careful though, with excessive use it can lead to dry, chemically burned skin."
1,Bad Luck?,"I just picked one of these up at Lowe's. Everything else I've ever bought that was made by Black & Decker was great, except this. I tried to fill an air tank I had which maxed out at 150 psi, I set the dial to 120 and let it run. About 10 minutes later it shut down, which it should do when it reaches the desired psi setting. In this case it had reached 85 psi and shut off. The unit smelled and felt very hot. After letting it cool, I was not able to get it running again. It may have blown a fuse, I'm not sure, but in either case it should not have gotten so hot and shut off well before it hit it's own limits. It looked like a nice unit, very handy, and good reviews found here which is why I bought it."
3,Not for YOUNG TEENS,"I am the mother of a 13 YO daughter that picked this up at our local library when she was with her girlfriend, and I saw it on our den table later that night. I told her that I had to read it first before she was going to read it.Boy, it opened my eyes to what she could have hidden from me if she chose to; subjects discussed in short stories are abortion (we are Catholic so that's a hot issue with us) abstinence (we parents can only wish our sons and daughters would do that for their own health and peace of mind)sexual control, gender preference confusion and other sexual topics.PARENTS OF TEENS: I would read it first cover to cover (2 hours of your time) and then let your teen read it; talk about the book, what they think about the subjects. It will open up doors for honest, sincere communication from both of you."
4,The music grows on you... not bad at all,"Well I bought the CD and at first I wasn't feeling this style of the songs. However, I listened and continue to listen to the whole CD and I must admit, I am now enjoying the different style. I am a big BJ fan and this CD offers a different range/style to the songs. Its a nice acoustic style versus the hard core guitar that you normally hear from BJ. Jon's voice is awesome. My only downer is there is not much of Richie's voice heard through-out the CD. Jon sings all the songs himself. All in all, I think a great new arrangement and style to the past hits. You can play this CD while entertaining friends because of its mellow acoustic style. These guys are indeed very talented musicians. Keep up the good work BJ!"
3,wrong edition,"The American Collector's edition has many factual errors (unlike the modern British edition) and suboptimal diagrams. With all editions, it is important to understand that this is a systems based atlas - not a regional atlas. If one wants to trace every branch of an artery, it is very helpful. To understand the relationship between a vessel and nerves in proximity, it is lacking. However, unlike most atlases (Netter, Clemente, Sobatta, Grant's, Thieme, Pernkopf, not to mention the numerous but little helpful photographic atlases), it has considerable text in addition to labels. As a general surgeon (and trauma surgeon for war wounded), I would always pick a regional atlas in preference for clinical work. I've used almost all the atlases at one time or another, and this would be near the bottom of my list for usefulness.LCDR Philo Calhoun MD"
3,Not what I was expecting...,"For as long as I can remember, ""The Haunting of Hill House"" has been regarded as one of the greatest horror novels ever written. I do not agree. It is well written and the premise is perfect, but Jackson fails to deliver the punch that the novel promises. The ending was terrible. The whole reason behind the haunting is never explained, although we are left to assume that the good doctor knew all along. I also purchased the film version, and it, too was a let down. Maybe this novel blazed a trail when it was first published. I know that it has been copied in some form or fashion ever since. Many writers and directors praise this novel and film, and credit one or the other with shaping his or her career, but I didn't see what the fuss was all about."
2,The Life With God Bible,The Life With God Bible. The print in this Bible was too small for me to read. I am returning it to Pinson Logistics for a refund. I will order another version at a later date.
5,Authentic Girl Group Sounds I,"Wait a minute! Was that a new ""girl group"" song or do I remember hearing it in 1963? I'm telling you that you're correct! You won't believe your ears when listening to this Rochester, NY based band. This is not an ""oldies"" group. It's My Party is a band that sings and plays songs (both tasty covers and many originals) in the ""girl group"" style, just like thousands of bands yearning to sound like the Kingsmen reproduce that sound. This band captures the feel of the genre with their original songs, containing arrangements to satisfy any purist. If you think they might be just a studio concoction, take my advice and RUN . . . don't walk to hear them live! The band comes with horns, vibes . . . everything to get that sound! Their praises have been sung by members of veteran girl groups like the Cookies, Toys, Jaynetts, Fashions, Shangri-Las and Raindrops! Check it out!"
3,boar hair brush,Excellent product even though it was much smaller than I expected (almost child size). It doesn't matter. My head only has hair on the bottom half.Diane Reinforced Boar Bristle Club Brush #8158
5,I love you mom!,"Mom, you are my best friend, my shining light, my inspiration! Thank you for using my drawing on the cover of your book. To be a part of your first book means the world to me and I support you 100% in your future endeavors! I love you mommy!"
1,Rotten old stinking old stud finder,"What a rip, this product is worthless do not waste your money.After several hours trying to find a stud with this thing I finally found one stud but I think I just got lucky.My wife thought I was doing something wrong so she tried and after a while she said ""throw it in the trash""."
4,Excellent programming book,"Great book. Comprehensive and conversational. This covers a lot of reference-book-style material in a friendly and easy to understand style. The only drawback would be that it is slightly difficult to find material one is looking for from time to time as some of the material is relegated to a FAQ section behind each chapter. Other great general C programming books are C: A Reference Manual, Harbison and Steele, and Programming with GNU Software, Loukides and Oram."
2,Unreliable in the Long Run,"I have had two of these units. Both seemed very good at first. With the first one the battery failed after a few years of operation. I found it is not feasible to replace the battery, but at least the software told me what the problem was. The second one has now become nothing more than a very bulky surge protector. When the power fails it just cuts off suddenly. What`s worse, the software gives no indication that anything is wrong. I intend to junk this unit and buy a different, more expensive brand, in hopes of more reliability."
5,This is the Best One.,"If any album is a must by for MSB fans it is this one. Cabin Fever is a THE BEST produced and BEST sounding of all MSB's records. . It also sounds delicious because the use of tasteful melodies, backing vocals and strings. Plus, this was also pre Pelaner/Stanley over compressed, over eq'ed bombastic productions. Michael's voice sounded great. He performed his role of a singer, not a yeller, like later in his career. This Album also features the playing of other great band members like Gary Markasky. His solo at the end of ""Why Should Love Be This Way"" is the best solo ever on any MSB album. WARNING: Do not buy the single with a hack job of an edit in this solo.So skip buying the well know mediocrity of later years, and buy this one instead. JGCRS."
4,For All Amoricans!,"Like most Amoricans out there...I couldn't wait to get my hands on Cabin Fever. ""Before The Frost...Until The Freeze"" CD captured live on DVD. I found it to be very laid back. I was hoping for more of the older Crowes style, but was very impressed with the dynamics and chemistry that these guys have developed over the years. I've been a big fan since the first album came out. I've seen a lot of their live shows. Cabin Fever hit me different. I've watched it a few times since my purchase. It has grown on me a great deal. I like the direction that the Crowes have taken. With that being said....I am a true Amorican, and that I will continue to follow that direction with them. Peace!"
1,Just terrible,If you are buying this for the 802.11a don't bother. After fighting to get it even working with factory defaults I finally got it up and running. Then I opened port 80 on my firewall and the router crashed and I had to hard reset it. Once I finally got it to connect agian I could not enable WEP. Once you enable WEP on the 802.11a network the network stops broadcasting. So long as all you want out of it is factory defaults you may be ok.The product basically does not work at all for 802.11a.
2,Not a fan,"I did not like this movie. Matter of fact, I couldn't bring myself to finish it. I am rating it two starts because my husband said it was ok. He has more of a taste for these kind of movies than I do.I thought the funny parts were not very funny. I didn't really care what happened to Dirt or anyone in it."
5,I GET GIRLS,"I'M ABOUT MEETIN GIRLS, I'M ABOUT MEETIN GUYS.I'M SCORES MAN DAMN IT.I GET GIRLS WITH MAMBO. FROM STRIPPERS TO REGULAR CHICKS.T-O-P-L-E-S-S"
3,Blu-Ray BUYER BEWARE,"I just received this dvd and was looking forward to watching it. Actually I had just ordered 5 blu-ray discs from Amazon. Imagine my surprise when none of them would play in my blu-ray player. There was a disclaimer with the disc that it was recorded in the highest possible fashion and might not be rendered as well in an older player (mine is 2 years old), but nothing to the fact that it would NOT play at all. Also, the trouble web site displayed is nonexistent. Although this is not Amazon's fault, I wanted to warn other blu-ray buyers. I think this is a lousy way for Sony to treat customers who have previously bought blu-ray products. I've been a Sony purchaser for over 30 years, but they just lost a consumer."
1,Garbage - Constant problems reading DVDs,"Simply put, the low price isn't worth the trouble. I picked up one of these to throw in a spare room and it constantly has trouble reading DVDs. Many of the DVDs I use nowadays are from Netflix and this player fails to read at least half of them. It doesn't do so well on the DVDs I own either.Save yourself the trouble and just spend a little more money."
2,not up to burkes standard,"not a patch on the previous burke novels the ending was terrible I have4 read most of his novels and I am a great fan, but this was not good."
2,Dvd,The item arrived quickly but the disc was loose in the case so it earned a few scratches in transit.
2,"Please Go Away, Now.","After spending a few weeks in Europe, I was constantly forced to listent to this. The Darkness, a band, or a joke, im not quite sure which, is currently the hottest thing in England and much of surrounding western Europe. Their music which can only be explained as some kind of operatic, 80's hair band pap. I remember thinking to myself, everytime this would come on (and believe me, it's everywhere -- MTV, radio,etc), why does this exist? Why are they doing this to me?So, back home in the U.S. Luckily, nowadays, I can fire up my computer and have the whole album in my hands in a matter of minutes. Because, god knows, im certainly not going to entertain buying this, but I had to know, what is the rest of it like? Maybe it will be good?Nope.It's horrible. Im sorry, i know a lot of you love it, but why? Musically, it's not bad. But that voice, that awful, awful voice. If this breaks in america, all of my fears will have been answered. We really are dumb."
2,Poor life,"When I first purchased my battery backup, the original battery life was 3 years now I can barely get a year and and a half. Purchased this in April of 2010 now the replacement light is back on."
4,Thoroughly enjoyable!,This was really a different book. I really enjoyed it. Not too scary or intense but just enough creepiness mixed with humor and great characters. I loved it!
4,Mambo of the Fiftys,Good songs. Cherry Pink and Apple Bloosom White and one of my all time favorites--Donde Estabas Tu-- among others.
4,Tough transcendental sledding,"Rahner's ""Foundations"" is a long, bumpy, difficult ride. The concepts are brilliant and challenging. They undoubtedly illuminate the faith of Christians and profoundly portray Catholicism. Rahner's mode of expression, however, is dense and difficult...."
2,"Greatest concert perhaps, but bass overdub kills it","I agree with the other reviewers here that the playing on this disc is exceptional and one of a kind. However, the Mingus overdubs which compensate for lackluster bass sound quality in the original are plodding, poorly equalized and seem disconnected entirely from the group. I would much rather have forgone the bass altogether for the ""original"" master tapes to keep the integrity of the group."
2,Repetitive Slow Read,"With proper editing, this book could have been reduced to a quarter of its length. Other than being extremely repetitive, the book is also a slow read. It is not surprising the authors are journalists. You should read Sammy the Bull's Underboss first, then pick up this book to get a different perspective."
1,Did musical genius kid loco REALLY put his name to this?,"having heard a grand love story and his dj kicks i was SEVERELY disappointed with this CD. can it be true that such a mastermind as kid loco really had anything to do with this album? why are there vocals? where are the off-the-wall and bizarre tracks i love him for? is there a whole other kid loco that i have just never heard of? almost every track grated on my hearing.in a nutshell - if you, like me, thought his dj kicks was absolutely amazing, then DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BUY THIS CD."
2,Overhyped and Overrated,"I played this game in the store on base for about an hour or so...what a letdown. I knew there was no-way it could live up to the hype, but this game is bland, boring and the graphix could be found on a PS2. The gunz feel like you are shooting a BB gun. Save your $$$ for COD4."
2,Deluxe Swivel Seat Cushion,"This product works great on a chair such as a dining room chair. However, it will not work in a bucket style car seat due to the contour of the bucket seat bottom thus preventing the cushion from swiveling. It's advertised to work in a car and it may work in a back seat but definitely not in a front seat."
4,4 1/2 stars for the humor and everything else that's garwood,"first off, connor is the least hero that i like in garwood's historical. besides having a low sense of humor, he has hardly shown that usual unconscious affection towards his lady love that garwood grants her chieftain/warrior/delicious-to-the-kilt characters. more often than not, he is rude and sometimes even indifferent to brenna.brenna, fortunately, is a very likeable heroine. her idiosyncrasies are so adorable.but what i really loved about this story was, of course, as the title says, THE wedding. that was simply an outright joy to read. the way the priest managed to bless not just the couple but the other warriors as well since brenna was walking in circles around him was hilarious.the other scene i could never forget was little grace's confession to alec. now that was a kid for you. she was absolutely adorable when she replied, ""i love you, papa,"" when asked by alec what really happened between jamie and brenna...lol..."
2,Eh,"Predictable and trite gay B movie. One of the parade of gay indie films trying too hard without focusing on the details of good writing, direction and acting. It's interesting enough to pass the time if you're bored, but not good enough to care about any of the characters."
1,Hit piece against a godly woman,Another in a line of hit-pieces against a godly woman who is telling the truth on the Bible versions issue. What a waste of paper.
5,A figurative light bulb to generate a desire in a child to be an inventor,"I first read this book when I was in early elementary school and the effect was so strong that for years I fantasized that I was an inventor like Edison with my own research laboratory. Edison was one of the most fascinating men, his inventive genius was second to none and there was never a man more driven than he was.Edison was largely uneducated; he was pulled out of school when his teacher grew angry over his constant asking of questions. Many people doubted his abilities, yet the combination of intense drive and extreme innate intelligence makes his story an inspiration that will live as long as his inventions do. Which will be as long as humans maintain a society based on technology."
1,inaccurate ingredients list on amazon,"Ingredients list on Amazon website says: ""Seaweed (Finest Korean Kim), Sesame Oil, Sea Salt."" However, I was very disappointed what I received my order to find out on the package that Canola Oil comes before Sesame Oil. Canola Oil is a cheaper oil; it's not an oil we believe to be healthy. We don't understand how such a mistake can be made! Unfortunately, we took the 24 pack order on a 2 months overseas trip and will not be able to return the order."
1,What happened to Clancy?,"I've read every thing Clancy has written. I've loved everything that Clancy has written. Whether it's 700 or 1000 pages I blaze through his books hanging on every word, but Teeth of the Tiger is horrible.It's slow. He repeats himself. After reading half way into the book the plot is very predictable. He tries to cover the lack of plot with detailed descriptions of everything from the mundane to the cuisine of Vienna but the last 100 pages were as slow as the first 100 pages.I rarely hate a book. I've never finished a book this bad."
3,interesting to say the least,"my best friend and i watched this one night, and it was cool. It seemed somewhat over acted, but it was hilarious when one of the dudes gets mad about everything, thinking he is more important than the rest. all in all was okay."
2,"Great disc and hard to find in the stores, lousy shipping",Loved this disk since its' release in 93. Just never got around to buying it. Would've been nice if the shipping had taken the time it was supposed to. Took 3 extra days. I'd ordered this for a business trip and came within a day of not having it.
1,Don't buy this book,"This book is a waste of paper. The only worthwhile information is copied from other books, in diluted form! Most of the entries are so general to be of no value. Spend your money elsewhere, and save a tree."
3,"Good Scale, Bad Body Fat Analysis","In general this scale is consistent with respect to both body weight and body fat; however, the scale is not measuring body fat, it's calculating it based on the input of height, maybe some effect to age and the user's weight - hence some reviewers calling for a ""body type"" setting.I must admit that ""they got me"" on this one as I assumed this scale was actually measuring body fat as it appears to have receptors for transmission of electrical current to actually ""measure"" body fat. It's simply not the case. At 6'1"", 191lbs, it measures my body fat to 25.1, which is essentially my calculated BMI give or take a few tenths. BMI of course does not give effect to a user's build, just weight to height.Overall if you're looking for a simple scale you can count on consistent readings, but it's not a true body fat analyzer. If you want true body fat analysis look for a scale that uses ""bioelectrical impedance analysis""."
5,Stunningly good,"Cherish the Aloha and savor these fine 1920's selections that time has not forgotten. Celebrate Rose's sweet falsetto, Tau, Lani and Dorian's great playing and harmonies, and Bob Brozman's gentle musical ""laying of hands"" on this project. Standing-OH! Bravo, Bob, and thanks!"
1,Absolute waste of time,"I rarely quit books especially if I have invested 400 pages into them, but I quit this one. I know Oprah likes Wally Lamb and I have enjoyed some Oprah books in the past but this was a huge disappointment. The main character is a bitter guy. Lamb does a poor job in character development. Would make a good Lifetime Channel movie.If you read an 800 page book, you should at least learn something if the writing is not so special, but there is no educational value either. There is a mentally ill chracter in the book so Lamb could have used this opportunity to educate the reader on some of those issues but I felt that it was minimally researched. Skip this one. If you want to read other Oprah books try:A Fine Balance (I think this Oprah's best selection so far)House of Sand and Fog"
3,Worked pretty well till it broke,"My Magic Bullet worked fine until it randomly broke. I had it for a year and a half, and usually used it at least once a day. Smoothies were a staple in my diet. It does NOT work well as a juicer. But I should point out I have never seen another juicer so maybe they just annoy me.Mine broke the same way as that of A. Verchimak of Illinois. I was belnding something and I heard a crack, and then the motor sounded really high pitched, and it stopped spinning the blade. When I picked it up I saw that teh bottom black part was cracked. I am debating weather to buy it again."
3,Could be better,good album some good rangers songs on here BUT it's not the greatest still looking for a better collection has to many half rangers songs on and bad recordings of some rangers classics.
1,Do not buy this product,"According to Haier Customer Service, this thing is only designed to ""cool"" to 45 degrees F. That is completely inadequate in my mind for a ""beverage center."" This fact is not in the user manual and it is not documented anywhere in the detailed specs here or at Haier's website. If I had known this fact, I would NOT have purchased this machine. As it is, I will probably donate it to a charity organization and buy a product that is designed for use in the real world....and it won't be a Haier product."
3,Fun For Kids,This was fun for the boys when they first got it. Now I need to have their mother find it and the electronic leap pad it goes on so the baby can use it.
3,Not what picture shows,"In the picture listed, it shows the mounting to be the three hole plate. I should have read the description better, where it said they were made of PLASTIC. The mounting for this piece is just the top two holes, where I assume you slide it behind the plate on your windshield. It looks nice, but being that its plastic I dont have high hopes on it lasting very long. Its a shame, because its a great idea!"
2,Yawn,"Who are all these people? I forgot. I've read this entire series twice, and by the time I get to Path of Daggers, I've already forgotten who everybody is. Most people don't even make it past Fires of Heaven, the legendary ""most boring book in the entire series."" The man's descriptions and syntax are disturbingly akward for an author who has put out eight books. Jordan's got me ""chasing the Dragon"", so to speak, and I must read on to the end, but please, god, let the end be soon."
4,review,"Asiago is one of my favorite cheeses. It is great to cut into small cubes and have with wine, or to use when making italian pizza or pasta (grated). I suggest getting the aged asiago though because it has a little more flavor to it. This is a very good brand for asiago cheese."
2,A beautiful looking watch but doesn't work!,"I received my watch yesterday, and was so impressed with the packaging, the box from Stuhrling, the weight and feel of the watch, and the face and skeleton works is incredible. I thought this was the coolest watch I've ever had. I wound it gently to get it started . . .it ran for a couple hours then STOPPED, I wound it again, and 10 minutes later, stopped again. Then I thought, I'll wind it and wear it allowing the self winding mechanism to do its job. So disappointed, it stopped two more times, so I sadly placed everything back in the orignal packing, and am going to drop it off at UPS Monday to ship back to Amazon. Too bad, as the look is impressive, but I really need it to run too!!!!! Now, I'm afraid to order another Stuhrling watch for fear of the same experience. I will say Amazon is always great about returns, but I want a Skeleton watch that runs!"
2,A disappointing book,"I have always been interested in polar exploration. I enjoyed ""Andree's Story"" and looked forward to this book. But I found the author's pretentious and unscientific style (every third word is I, and he goes on ad nauseam about his archaeologocial expertise and the fact that he visited Danes Island) quite distracting.Still, if you are interested in the topic and if you want to learn more about Walter Wellman's expeditions, this book may be for you."
2,Disapointed but willing to compromise,"Yes, it's too bad: this should have been a fantastic set.Never having seen Chaplin's earliest works, being a fan sincemy pre-teens, I was excited by the potential of these DVD's.Now, I'm no film historian or expert, but... I was immediatelystruck by the poor quality of the images, the fact that actors'heads were chopped off, the framing obviously out of whack,and what's with the godawful music? I like to think that anyonecapable of putting together such an ambitious project would want to take the care to do it justice. Alas... This seems to havethrown together for capital gain, lacking much sense of artisticintegrity. Ick.(Note: I've only seen the first two DVD's so far... I hear things get better later on.)"
1,Child will smack face on floor if child is able to sit up when chair is not in stationary position,"Why has this item not been recalled?! Any child able to sit up will fall face froward if this chair is not in the stationary position, even buckled in! This is incredibly dangerous! Who is giving this item 4-5 stars and why?! This cannot be unique to my rocker. These people must have reviewed the item prematurely ... before noticing this and they did not bother to update. Omg!"
2,Probably wonderful pants but I ordered size 18 and was sent a size 24,"I checked size 18, which was the only size left, and got a 24. I cannot wear these but the hassle of returning them isn't worth it. Please correct the sizing info on this item."
2,An Essay Masquerading As A Book: Annoyed Me!,"My Rating: 2 starsBrief Summary: This 48-page book (half of which are photos!) is an essay on why we should all give up the burden of perfectionism.Brief Thoughts (But Really A Rant): I can't even begin to tell you how annoyed I am that this ""book"" is being sold for $12.95 ($17.95 in Canada). And this isn't even Quindlen's first offense of this nature!!! She did the same thing with A Short Guide to A Happy Life (with the emphasis being on ""short""). There is nothing in here you can't find somewhere else for considerably less money or for free. I literally read the entire book while eating lunch! I used to like Quindlen, but think her writing has gone steadily downhill. (I thought her novel Rise and Shine was horrible. But at least you got over 200 pages!) This feels like a popular author doing a money grab, and I, for one, am annoyed by it."
5,Very fast,Very happy with the amount of time it took to get to my home. I ordered and it came the next week. Great!!
4,Useful and well-organized info for New Mexico landscaping,"As a fellow person in the landscape design profession locally, I am pleased with my purchase, though I don't agree with every bit of information in the book. Most important, though, Judith illustrates the subtle, yet important factors that influence how plants can grow sucessfully and where in our region. I have had some different experiences with climate data and some plants (Mesquite is one) than she has, but I highly recommend that natives and new arrivals alike apply the facts in this book to avoid the common plant mistakes made in New Mexico!"
1,What were they thinking???,"I adore The Cure. They are great live or in the studio. Their songs have a uniqueness that cannot be heard in any other music. This tribute cheapens The Cure. It sounds nothing like them. It's not a type of music I enjoy. However, you must be your own judge. If you are a Cure fan, listen to some of these samples and ask yourself if they are at all like the original. I don't see how it would be possible for any true Cure fan to own this."
3,Good Poster but poor quality framing,The poster itself is great however after deciding to purchase the pre-framing service (which is not cheap) I didn't think the quality would be so poor. I recommend purchasing the poster from here and having the framing done locally.
5,Like the shelf,I Really like the shelf. It was easy to put together and it looks great. I'm going to order another one.
1,Unhappily in search again of a vacuum,"Very unhappy with this item and when I wrote to the seller, I found they weren't willing to back up their product with too much customer care. It stopped working within 3times of use. The suction was very low and it started to smell like it was burning. The belt was still working but the motor was getting hot. So I am again in search...."
4,Electric fence doesn't work,The collar worked well to stop the barking but confused our dog with the electric fence collar. Now we have a bark free beagle who is an escape artist.
5,Broadcasters Review of Andre Rieu Video,I have been in the broadcast and music businessfor 35 years and the Andre Rieu video entitled'The Homecoming' is remarkable. It is well producedand the music appeals to almost any demographicgroup. It can be viewed over and over without fatigue!By Dave Fricker
1,Read it in LEGENDS instead,"Four stars for the story, one star for this printing. This is a good prequel to the Sword of Truth series, giving background information on Zedd. Don't bother buying it as a separate book, when you can get basically the same story in the LEGENDS collection of short stories. Plus, there's a short story by George R.R. Martin (A Song of Ice and Fire prequel) in the same book."
2,ok sound but does not fits in ear well,the sound quality is good of this product but it falls so frequently from the ear that i cant use it to listen for a single song while moving or so ...... ll recommend this product if u have big ears...
3,"Beautiful Model, Just Not Durable for Real Little Kids","I'll make this really quick. Papo makes extraordinary models. This Spinosaurus is no different' The detail is amazing, the size is very impressive, and overall it's a great piece.The only thing I would say is that if you are buying this for little kids that are pretty rough with their toys, it will likely break. My 3 year old busted the right arm off a week in. Later, a another piece. Later still a toe.He still plays with it, and loves it as, again, it's a great toy. However, Shleich dinos are far more durable. We have about 12 of them - they add up with 3 boys - and we have not broken one yet.So, I - more like my boys - highly recommend the toy with that one qualification."
2,a rare find . . .,and what i mean by that is this . . . i fell asleep on the movie THREE times. THREE!! and that being the case i suggest watching this movie at your own risk. what i really am most disappointed about in this movie is that it was really long . . . and i wasn't expecting that. i just wish i was warned about that. and i haven't seen the sequel and and don't know when i will . . . only after it comes on cable a couple of times . . . because the sequel is longer than this one
4,Well written,"These vignettes of bad girls from the Bible are well written, humorous and thought provoking."
5,"Warm, Wonderful and Witty....You'll Fall for Gracie Too!","Falling for Gracie was a warm and spirited book. It was refreshing to read a romance filled with humor, warmth and strong characters. There were many lessons to be learned in this book a few being honesty, integrity and the art of communication. A very sensual romance, one I will read, over and over.Gracie's character was strong, spirited, fun, intelligent, and warm even though her family had sent her adrift. Riley, how does one describe an alpha male at his finest? Tall, dark, handsome, aloof and by his past...mistrusting, tormented and angry.How Gracie and Riley come together begins with their knowing each other in their past but now they meet again and sparks fly, while the entire town looks on and becomes involved in their romance.I highly recommend this book. It is one of Susan Mallery's finest."
3,Can you say Every Time I Die?,"A blatant rip off of every time i die. If they're a rip off of someone else, well, then just keep going down the chain until you get to the original. Too many of the songs are based off the standard blues scale. They sort of blend together. Also, the vocalist lacks so much of what ETID's brings.Nothing special.They are Christian, though, and if you don't like 'godless' music, then go for it. Course, you're missing better music.The name is sorta stupid, too, for how unshocking the sound is."
1,Do not buy a Roomba,"My Wife purchased a Roomba about two year ago. About a year after it was purchase the Roomba stoped working, it would not take the programing. My wife call Roomba and the replaced the unit. After about 6 months the Roomba stoped working again this time Roomba would not replace the unit. I think they only work untill the warrenty runs out. When we contacted the company they said that they could not help us. We will never buy another Roomba and would not recomend one"
5,It's all about Jimmy!,"I will watch any movie that has Jimmy Cagney dancing in it. Forget the gangster flix, give me the dance numbers. I don't care about the plot as long as Jimmy dances! If you feel the same way, watch this film."
2,Meh,"I bought this dryer after getting sick of having to share my old one with 5 other family members. It's neither great nor horrible.It does what it is designed to do - dry hair. That's about where the positives end. The dryer is very heavy and it takes a good seven minutes or so to dry my baby fine, shoulder length hair. The buttons on the dryer are in an awkward place and I'm forever accidentally bumping them and switching the settings or accidentally turning it off, mid-dry. I did not notice any difference in my hair using this dryer with its purported ion technology. The thing that annoys me the most about this dryer is the cord. It's nowhere near long enough for my liking. It's so short that I barely have enough length to dry my hair without sitting down - and I'm 5'3""! Bottom line: If you need ""just"" a hairdryer for a short amount of time and don't care that it's heavy/slow/has a short cord - then this is the dryer for you."
1,BAD,The Eau de toillette was not the original nor the package and the smell was all evaporated: my experience with this product was not good
2,A Little Disappointed.,"I purchased Haven and Damage Done at the same time and have been banging my head to Damage Done<which I review on that album separately> but just could not get into Haven, and believe me I consider myself an open-minded metal-head and gave this album several listens. I just didn't like the direction they went on this album, kinda like a riffy-tech metal based around keyboard kinda sound, and the vocals in some areas sounds like Rammstein. It just seemed to me they were trying to go a little more commercial on this one, but in the process they lost some of there balls. On a positive note I did like 'Feast of Burden' and 'Rundown' and DEFINITELY wish they would have gone more in THAT direction but unfortunatly two good songs don't make a five star album. 2 stars definitely."
5,Combined games and more,"Pokemon Emerald is like a combination of Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire, with a bit of a new story, with moving pokemon and a new island, the battle fronteer! What could be better than that? Because these games are combined, there are more oppertunities to catch pokemon that weren't in the other versions, and make it more interesting to see pokemon in battles or the wild. The battle fronteer makes it worthwile to play the game after it is beaten. I think this was a great idea for nintendo to do."
2,Dual disk problems!,"This disk would not work in two differentdrives in my computers and in my regular cd player (a Samsung) it would take over a minute to load and then would not play track one (but played the others ok). Not so happy with this.As for the music, it is a clasic."
2,pure speculation,i have read the book and i keep wondering if any of this really true. it is just pure specualtion. idle gossip. but it was fun reading it. why was so much attention given to grace kelly when she only made a couple pictures with MGM. katharine hepburn was a much bigger star and the author gave her a couple of pages. just not enough.
1,Too small,"I wasn't too happy with this cosmetic bag. It was a little cheapy bag. Because it's white, it got dirty too fast and fell apart very quickly."
4,"""Bennett"" Fits Fine 'tween ""Backstreet"" and ""Brittney,"" Kids","Tony Bennett, at this point in his legendary career, is nearly incapable of making a poor album. Here, singing about, to, and for children, his work is especially elegant and empathetic. The title song, written by the Bergmans, is a jazzy piece of childhood nostalgia. His versions of ""All God's Chillen' Got Rhythm,"" (featuring a killer brush drum solo!) ""Paper Moon,"" and his versions of the Disney songs swing sweetly with help from the Ralph Sharon Trio. The final, unlisted track on my copy of the CD is ""Christmas in Herald Square,"" a New York sequel of sorts to ""The Christmas Song."" Bennett sings it beautifully. ""The Playground"" is a wonderful place for children and adults to spend time. It's an album Frank Sinatra never got the chance to do and Dean Martin, well...."
2,Boring!,I thought I was missing something significant about this book until I read the other reviews. I'm with the people who gave this book one or two stars. Too descriptive and not enough action. This must be a novel for people of higher intellect.
4,Great Mexican Tuners action Movie,"I enjoyed this movie. A lot different than Fast and Furious, but that's good. We don't need another of the same anyway. Yes, there are Fast Tuner cars, pretty girls but in this movie also a lot of violence so watch the kiddies on this one. Sort of a ""B"" movie, sometimes acting is marginal and the end is somewhat confusing but great entertainment anyway and I recommend it."
3,Moneyball,"I thought it moved slowly in the beginning. This movie was ok, but I was expecting much more since I'm a big sports fan."
1,Not childproof,"It was great for about 2 weeks. Then, my 10 month old figured out how to pull them off. I gave up on using them."
3,"Sharp, yes, but . . . .","After all the hype, I was a little disappointed. They are sharp, but somehow hard to position correctly, and the angle of the clipper handle seems odd."
4,Perfect drumsticks for a toddler,"My son is in love with drums! His dad is a drummer and he's always wanting to use daddy's set, but the sticks are just too big for his 2 1/2 year old hands. I found these and they are big and light enough for him to handle successfully. I wish that they looked more like an adult stick,(not blue, but natural wood)...overall they have served its purpose."
3,Very Hollywood,"Why were Errol Flynn and Claude Rains considered great actors?Errol looks foolish and Claude appears to be dead. The film itself is overlong, inaccurate, and very Hollywood. Eric Portman, a great actor, is completely wasted. Kind of fun if youlike old movies, otherwise don't bother."
3,Its just ok,I wanted to love this movie but i thought it was just ok.....the kids liked it but they werent WOWed by it. Its language seemed a little too adult and a lot of jokes were adult based and the kids didnt understand. So its a 3 star movie from me.. Its worth the 3 dollar rental but not the 14 dollars to buy the DVD.
2,unsatisfied,"I'm a little unsatisfied about their second album. meanwhile their first album was much more interesting, this one pleases with mass audience. And forgive me I say that, but the guitars on these tracks are not necessairy. Is it because they produced the album in the states? American productions deal with guitars all the time. why?"
1,so boring turn it off pleasse,i can't believe people call this prog it is so boring and theres no shreding how can it be good if he doesn't shred also danny carey is overrated mike prntoy from dream theater is way better if u don't think so u don't know what u r takling abut my drum teacher told me drew carey is not very good and he's a good techer his name is richard baxter and he lives on the street he can play better thyan jim carey any day.go buy train of thought is the best album ever also nick from louieville shut up u r not troo prog u probably liek pain of salvation too.
4,"Great writer, good plan, somewhat outdated.","Dick Fabian really cared about teaching people what he had learned from investing. Sadly, his son is money hungry and didn't keep up the free info that is referenced in the book on the website. I learned a lot about investing and some basic strategies to avoid major losses in the stock market. His theory isn't going to make you rich overnight, but hopefully it will raise your rate of return a couple of points over your lifetime, which could mean big bucks for some people. If you look closely, he says shoot for 20%, but he even points out that his picks over time only got him 14%. I will say one thing, if you would have used his plan, you would have been out of the market during the whole stock market crash in 2000-2002 and back in the thing in 2003. That alone makes this worth a read."
3,Jack and the wolf,"The second time I read this book it was much much better (the first time I was quite young). Jack is one of the strongest characters S.K. has developed. However, you seem to be able to tell where Stephens influences were and where they were not. The wolf storyline could have been scaled back somewhat and the Sunshine School and Oatley Tap could have stood some cutting down as well. After all, we were on a journey across the country. Over-all, I rate this book a three (the second time around) because it gives us a character we really care about and is definitely an interesting part of THE GUNSLINGER."
3,big band,"The watch face is big, almost too big for my small, woman's wrists. The main problem is the band is way too large and it is not easy to remove links unless you are a professional jeweler."
4,"Cheap, Good Quality Watch!!!","Very good quality watch, not as much options with it, but very good over all cheap and good looking. A-"
1,The most outrageous book I've read since Diana's death!,"I knew what I was getting into because I read ""Lady"" Campbell's first book about Diana published when she was alive. The book is outrageously funny because ""Lady"" has taken every negative thing one could say about ANY person and pinned it all on Diana. Anyone who believes this trashing deserves to be ripped off for price of the book. I was armed with a true and believable comprehensive background on the royal family. Read Anthony Holden or Donald Spoto for quality instead of this wanna-be, wanna-he author. And, finally, Colin should have airbrushed that Adam's Apple out of his picture. I'd love to read a book on ""Lady"" Campbell."
1,can't buy it :(,I want to buy this movie but it doesn't exist in amazon.co.uk for region 2 (for Turkey).It's only for region 1 :(
3,Cute,"Cute and absorbant. They shed in the wash the first few times. Velcro back (eh) and the length while handy at times, can also be cumbersome. My baby did get a ton of adoring compliments for it's originality when she wore it though!"
5,Only if You Want to Know the TRUTH,"Some people don't want to know. Some people think they have it already.Some people's mind block it and will not let it in. There are others who by nature must know for themselves and are willing to investigate.Terrorstorm is for the latter group. The TRUTH is ugly. In fact a kind of ""worst case scenario"".America was conned AGAIN by warmongers!"
3,Buy the Insurance if you get this phone...,"I bought this phone for my husband for fathers day... I was concerned that it was too thin and would easily break. I asked the online customer service and she said she had not heard of any problems and that the phone was very sturdy. I evne asked the in store customer service representatives--especially with all the talk about how small it was--fits in a pocket--ultra thin design ect.Needless to say, I was extremely dissapointed when the liquide crystal display broke in his pocket--the phone was not dropped--and there is no external damage. normal use. He was only able to use the phone for 2.5 weeks. We now have an additional year on our plane and we are out over $100."
1,Charlotte is no Jenny Lind,"I had heard enough about Charlotte Church that I thought that I would listen to her Greatest Hits album and judge for myself. As it turns out, I cannot see this CD even being considered good as a stand-alone album, let alone a Best Of album. Charlotte, in my opinion is vastly over-rated and is no better than many local girls who sing in my area. If she is going to keep singing, she better sing some original songs because virtually any girl can sing the songs from this album as good as she can."
3,Good but not Great,"So i was browsing around amazon and came across this chain it looked nice and cheap so i ordered, but when the chain came it i was really dissapointed. The picture was very decieving because it looks like a thick chain but it is soo thin you can hardly see it from a distance. However it is a strong chain and if you keep it nice and shiny it looks good. Also i think the 24"" chain is a better fit than the 22"""
5,Works Great for Nexus 10!,"Using this for a Nexus 10, and it works great! Lots of little adjustments, so I'd imagine this would work fine for a number of tablets. Would absolutely recommend."
4,whoa,"Definitely a decent peace of music and worth the money......I just don't understand one thing who the heck are eddie arnold and jim reeves mary ann rasuto nobody really cares what you think and if you dont like the album write one review and thats enough. DONT LIKE IT DONT BUY IT simplegreat album the man has made another classic""In My Life"" great song this is worth it right here"
2,Finish peels off,"I loved the look of these and the heavy weight. Brass workings. However, the finish peeled off. I bought mine (2 of them) at Sam's and they had to refund my money since they didn't have anymore in stock. I had spoken with the manufactures warranty dept and they said to take them back to Sams for a replacement. That's all they would do."
1,What's the point?,"I read and read, not wanting to put it down, waiting to get to the point. The author could certainly write. However, my true test of a book is, when it is all said and done, am I happy I read it or do I feel cheated?I felt cheated. The ending killed the book. I wish I had not spent so much time on this one."
1,Don't do it!,"If you are considering this book for A.P Europoean History at M.H.S., don't do it. It is very tedious to finish, and the writing style is horrific.Also, if your name is Phil, don't do it."
4,I love vampires their out!!,Vampire diaries is a really good show with some FINE men to help to keep watching! Season two was really good more Damon with no shirt Please?!
5,A perfect marriage of tradition and modern,The voice of Sinead O'Connor on Foggy Dew is incredibly haunting and beautiful. Rocky Road to Dublin with the Rolling Stones is joyous rollicking music. Sting's singing on the opening track is wonderful. Change in your Demeanor is my favorite track on the CD. The blend of rock/pop stars with traditional Irish music as played by the chieftains works so well on this CD. I have given this cd as a gift to many of my friends. I couldn't imagine St. Patrick's day without this one.
4,A slapstick extravaganza with likable villains and a baby,"The first time I saw this movie, I laughed until I couldn't breathe. It harkens back to the very best Sweet Pea / Popeye cartoons, and involves three, otherwise very likeable, bumbling villain and a baby on the loose for his first taste of the world at large. Very good fun."
4,One of the first Glam Rock bands,"Virtually unknown in the US, Chicory tip preceeded Kiss by a few years. Their best known work being ""Son Of My Father"" charted mostly in the UK and the Continent. I would have given this CD 5 stars except for the exclusion of ""The Devil Rides Tonight"" (a rare gem) which never charted anywhere and which I obtained as a RAdio Promo 45 back in 1971."
4,"Simmons is a God, but a humble one???","After 30 years he finally admits how much he cares about only himself and no one else. This alone garnishes 4 stars!! The merchandising (sell-out) has found another way to empty our pocketbooks, but this is a good read. I've read the other biographies on Kiss and wondered if his own words would tell the truth, or pull the wool over the eyes of the die-hard fans that he claims to be ""the only people that matter."" I have to admit that I enjoyed the book. Even the pictures were good. I hate when (he) gets my attention."
1,Did not work,"I bought a battery for my compaq contura 410, but it did not workI reclaimed and received a refund for the item."
4,"A Charming, Fun Movie","I was very surprised how good this movie was. I wasn't expecting too much, I thought it would be a marketing hype with everyone making more money off of Justin and Kelly. Which it is... and yet, I was very entertained. I loved the music and the dancing. It was all very light hearted and very fun. It reminded me of the old Annette Funicello - Frankie Avalon movies. I thought Justin and Kelly did an excellent job. Amazing, a year ago, these kids were just ordinary kids. Today, movie stars. This was a very charming movie."
4,Redness Relief,"This product works for me. Each day I use Eucerin Redness Relief twice-a-day, and it keeps the redness to a low level. My daughter also has facial skin redness but cannot tolerate this Eucerin product, so it is not for everyone. Give it a try if many other things have failed."
3,QC is lacking,"Just received these chisels, and was quite pleased with them initially, until I set up to hone and strop them. 2 of the chisels were nicked rather significantly (approx 0.125 mm and 0.25 mm nicks)at the cutting edge requiring grinding (rather than honing)to make the edge(s) suitable for use. A third chisel required re-grinding as well due to an out of square bevel. I expected to hone and strop---not to have to grind. Once the chisels were all dressed, honed and stropped the were impressively sharp and capable of shaving end grain oak easily. My feeling is that 50% of a new set of chisels should not have to be ground, regardless of price."
4,Good read but...,"This book is one of the best books I have read but it is a bit disappointing as the storyline is weak. As the first book of the author it is a very good but as a Booker winner it is below expectations. The authoress's description of rural Kerela is pictoral, a good point of the book. The supporting characters seem to have sad lives and there is no cheer. The 4 central characters have been portrayed in a manner which is very unique.Roy's style is refreshing and there seem to be millions of plots running but this is due to the weak storyline."
2,Funny?,"Shucks folks, I don't mean to put a damper on things here, but honestly I didn't find a joke in this book that I thought was funny. I don't want to sound mean in the least, but I was very disappointed when opening the book to find out that the jokes contained didn't make me laugh. Then I thought about the money I spent on it, and it made it even harder for me to laugh. Now, I'm not boasting when I say I am a truly funny guy. But this is not funny. :(This is funny: Did you hear about the Amish couple that got a divorce? He was driving her buggy. :) Now, that's funny. I didn't find a joke like that in the book. Is this book some kind of a joke?"
4,Builds Off Strengthfinder,"If you are familiar with Strengthsfinder and you need to develop a sales force or, to a lesser degree, your own personal sales techniques, then this is a good purchase. On the otherhand, the other books are not a pre-req. There is enough intro to Strengthsfinder concepts reading the previous works that this book can give someone the basics if a sales focus is the only goal. I consider Strengthsfinder so valuable, that I'm glad to have read both."
3,It's not a Movie,"Beryl is perfect. You collect all the swells, all the gentlemen, all those perfect graduates of all the right schools that at the end of the Edwardian Era believe themselves to be the best of the best. You add to that roster all the blatant goldiggers, the social parentheticals and all those female trollers in whom their mothers had all the best hopes. You put them all on a ship bound into the winter North Atlantic; and in just one Neptunian inhalation you sink the boat.Never in the history of biology has fate and genetics so conspired to remove from our presence such a conceited and disgusting group. Beryl wrote this book with a sigh of relief and a chuckle; you should chuckle too. We are all better for the story and the biology."
5,Works well!,This is a nice fryer. I like the size and it is the perfect temperature for frying most things. I also like that I can cool the oil and store it in the fryer because it has a snap on cover. Very nice.
1,Disappointed,"We bought this cd to watch as a family on Christmas day, and my husband and I previewed it. It is not suitable to watch as a family. The couple makes out on the kitchen table and they also have foul language right and left throughout the movie. I highly do not recomend anyone from buying this to watch as a family! Very very disappointed."
3,Not a bad effort,"When I bought Ideal's cd a while back, I hadn't heard a single song off of it. But everyone was talking about these guys being the next big thing and that the song ""Get Gone"" was real hot. So i bought this album expecting a little too much I guess, cause when I gave it my first listen I wasn't all that impressed. Some of the songs are just plain, with little emotion, and I feel that Maverick just doesn't have what it takes to be a lead vocalist. However, there are some bright spots on this one. I just love the songs ""Creep Inn"" and ""Jealous Skies"". ""Get Gone"" although not what I hoped for, is still very respectable and I can see why it was a hit. It sort of reminds me of a lot of the songs on R. Kelly's last album ""R"". I know a lot of R&B fans will enjoy this album, so i really depends on one's taste's. I'm more of a Jodeci, New Edition, Jagged Edge man myself."
4,Nice Gentle Yoga,Very gentle easy yoga. I was looking for something for my mother who is 75. This will help her maintain and increase her flexibility. Poses start with wake up in bed and move to standing and chair. It's perfect for her. It's easy to follow and has a variety of stretches. It's a good beginning level especially for first timers.
3,Only a book of spells.,"This book is only a book and spells. It will not aid beginners in practising Wicca:If a person does not know how to raise and direct power, the most ancient of spells wil be ineffective.If you already practise Wicca please ignore my comments above.The Reviewer from Ohio listed below is unaware of how Wicca works.1. Every Wicca practitioner is a priest or priestess.2. The term High Priest or High Priestess is a meaningless term. The HP or HPS is the person that leads the ceremonies. It in no way means that person is able to direct more power than other members.For beginners wishing to explore Wicca. I would recommend ""Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner"" Scott Cunningham.If you have comments or questions; E-Mail me. Two Bears.Wah doh Ogedoda"
4,Charlie Trotter's Desserts,"This is a great book to draw inspiration from , but the recipes are not always accurate. I have enjoyed the book for over a year. The pictures alone are worth the price. The book may be better suited for those who are professionals and not the home cook."
2,RIP OFF !!!,"Thumbs DOWN! I bought this for the ""A Change Would Do You Good"" video. But where the hell is the Heather Matarazzo version? It had Ellen DeGeneres and Molly Shannon in it also. Instead were given a boring one camera shot of Crow lip syncing in the middle of a street! No wonder it was only $9.99. Pick it up used for less."
5,Absolutely Fantastic,"This is an amazing work. His album is full of songs that are full of substance, you can relate to them and he sings them very meaningfully. I Will Carry You is a fabulous song.Well done!"
1,Don't give this as a gradutation gift.,"I was given this book as a graduation gift. Not only was I insulted; I was forced to READ IT!!AHHH!!!THE AGONYI felt like I was back in preschool having a old lady tell me how to be a ""good little boy"".Kushner here's some advice for you:Bad things happen to everybody,except when they happen to an SOByou think they deserve it."
4,Some interesting info...,"First, I have not read this book nor have I tried this book, but I have read all the reviews, so I'm providing everyone with what I have learned from reading all of them. At this time there are 88 reviews. They break out as follows:*40 reviews, or 45% of the reviews say YES, IT WORKED FOR THEM*32 reviews, or 36% of the reviews were positive, but hadn't yet actually tried the method*9 reviews, or 10% of the reviews were negative, but didn't specifically say that they had tried it and had it not work*7 reviews, or 7% of the reviews had tried the methods and ended up with the opposite of the gender that they wantedHope everyone else found this as interesting as I did. Also worth noting, I didn't include people who said ""they knew someone who it worked for"", only people who said it worked firsthand for them (and there were quite a few people who knew others it worked for)."
1,WRITTEN HORRIBLY,"THIS BOOK WAS WRITTEN HORRIBLY, SORRY STICK TO UR TV PROGRAMTHE DETAILS OF MURDER THE BEGINNING OF STORY WAS SO STUPIDMURDER DETAILS SHOULD BE MID BOOK HELLO"
3,ok for money,"I bought this lemon a few months ago. It seemed to work well with car and bicycle air pressure. However,I made an error in rating. The unit worked ok, but my cigarette lighter fuse burned out . This item is worthwhile for buying."
2,Mixed review...,"When I first opened the box, I was impressed. These speakers were very much aesthetically pleasing. Also, the build quality was quite nice.As for the sound, these speakers are not so stellar. My first impression was that it was almost as if Bose had tried to make these speakers not image. I have sampled numerous speakers over the years, Martin Logans, Quads, B&Ws;, Magnepans, and various other brands, granted these are not computer speakers and are not in the same price range, they sound great and image fantastically. Even my cheap computer speakers image well. The Bose Companion 2 is full of decent sounding bass, but the mids and highs, though clear, are lacking, as is typical of Bose. Also, the lack of an on/off switch is quite odd, and disturbs me.These are decent speakers, but I would recommend that you try other brands before buying these."
5,"Great, clean show","Our family loves this show - nothing inappropriate or vulgar. Entertaining and light, yet hopeful about the triumph of true love and marriage."
5,Outstanding!,"This book is an excellent resource. After almost a year of job hunting, I bought this book, put its suggestions into practice, and within a month I had the interview that got me a job in my field. This book helps you generate a bank of success stories focusing on your experience, education, and skills, and shows you how to use them to best showcase yourself in an interview. It provides many example interview questions, and teaches you how to use your stories to answer those questions well, rather than offering canned responses that make all candidates sound the same. Finally, this book goes beyond interview questions and answers to cover other aspects (such as demeanor and attitude) that have a big impact on the impression you give a prospective employer. If you're job hunting, this book is your best investment."
4,Next Best Thing,"I played with GI Joes as a kid, so when I found Action Man in Hamley's, a London toy store, I had to buy one for my then 5 year old son. It's not the same one as here - the one I bought has alpine gear with skis, snowshoes, parka, and a rucksack. At first he liked it then it hit the toy bin for a year, but now he's been resurrected and I'd like to find more. The one I bought appeared to be part of an anniversary collection and limited production run. I've been back once or twice since and they were still being sold but never here in the states. I would definitely buy another and the options in the UK are fantastic, so I hope this reseller will carry more. Build quality isn't as good as the old GI Joes of the same size, but still decent enough."
2,Cooks too hot !,"This crockpot cooked much hotter than my last crockpot, so I am unable to use it as it burns my dinners prior to my arriving home. I need to cook dinners for at least 8 hours, and this one was just too fast for me to use, so I purchased another one that works better for me."
1,"Poor quality, not like store-bought blades","The other low reviews are right, these blades are cheap but terrible. I just went back to blades from the store, and what a difference! Now I can get 7 great shaves instead of 3-4 bad to awful shaves. Amazon needs to change their supplier, these blades are either fakes or manufactured to specs different from those meant for the US market, and we (the customers) are being ripped off."
2,Hmmmm...,"After all of the publicity surrounding this novel, I found the content disappointingly non-stimulating. The character descriptions were good, but strange, and the plot was difficult and frustrating to follow. I would not read this book a second time."
1,Don't buy this pad,"I bought this pad and the second day of using it, the back arrow stopped working, we returned it and got another thinking it was just a faulty pad, the second pad's back arrow stopped working after playing it for one hour. I am extremely frustrated after paying $100 for it. You'd think it would live up to the price you have to pay for it. I'm going to try something cheaper."
4,Interesting lessons from a time capsule,"I have been looking through this fascinating book for several days, and I am convinced that it gives me a good view into the classic education of Catholic children. Sister Miriam Joseph was truly dedicated to the value of such an education, and who can fault her?The book is very old-fashioned, and it may contain too much warmed-over Aristotle, but it does get some things absolutely right: logic and grammar are essential to good speaking and good writing, and rhetoric is an essential study for those who would try for excellence. Just today I was reading more complaints from English teachers about the faults of the current curriculum; every time they assign some writing, it comes in with horrifying mistakes in both grammar and logic.For a deeper (and more interesting) discussion of rhetoric, I would recommendFarnsworth's Classical English Rhetoric."
4,"An Excellent, Comprehensive History of 16th Century Russia","This work is a thorough history of Russia during the mid-16th century. The author presents a balanced view of the source material, emphasizing what is known, why it is known, and what is not known, about a critical formative period of Russia. That said, it is not a book for a beginner. It presupposes an understanding of Russian history and institutions, as well as some knowledge of the Russian language.One addition that would have been helpful would have been a set of ""family trees"" for the main princely and boyar families. The numerous Bel'skys, Shuiskys, not to mention the ubiquitous Iur'ev-Zakhar'ins (the later Romanovs) become very confusing. In addition, the author frequently refers to individuals by their initials, where the full name and patronymic would have been helpful."
1,How to fill 300 pages describing 3 skirmishes,What a bore!I wish this was covering more history. My ideas about washington and the first American army are pretty low now. I seemed like the Brits wanted us to win our freedom.
5,A execelent history.,"The book covers, in detail, the history of the Enterprise in World War II. I especially enjoy how personal comments and points of view were coveered. It was written almost like an historic novel, with detailed discription and accounts of the battles of Midway and Santa Cruz. The telling of the scene a Pearl Harbor is excelent. The heroism of the crrew is shown in many stories. This book is a must for all who love the history of WWII, It was well researched and very well written."
5,Smart Purchase!,"I wasn't sure I would have a need or use for any GPS but now that I have the TomTom I am so glad - I use it all the time. It is accurate, clear, sleek, user-friendly and an overall quality product. I have friends with the GPS built in to their cars and there are ridiculour flaws to the routes. My TomTom in superior! I use it to find new routes to regular commutes/travel and to discover new places to go in neihboring towns and in the city nearby. It is the best purchase and I am thrilled to have it - glad to answer any questions about it too - I'm a big fan!"
4,FDA approved vagus nerve stimulation-a much better therapy,"In February of 2005, the FDA approved vagus nerve stimulation as a treatment for chronic depression. With this approval, for many patients electro-convulsive therapy will no longer be the most aggressive way to treat their chronic disease. Max Fink's book is very helpful in explaining and comforting a patient that is fearful of ECT. There is a terrible stigma associated with shock therapy. If it works, the relapse rate is high. For my money, I think I will go with vagus nerve stimulation and its benefits which are apparently sustained over a long time."
3,It's just okay,The puzzles aren't very hard. I started on puzzle 100 and I'm working backward since the ones at the end are supposed to be hardest. I don't find them very challenging. Also the pages are small for Samurai (less than normal copy paper) and I would have liked them a little larger. Not my favorite book.
4,Attractive,"I do not know what it is, but I just love this book. It has small paper size and I could carry it with my all around. It has a very deep understanding of the principles without confusing you with 100 acronyms in one sentence and it was the only book, which really explained to me what the erythrocyte sedimentation rate really meant.Well, I read this book a long time ago and I still look it up every now and then. If you like authentic things (not all these overcoloured texts), then you will love this book."
4,Gets the Job Done,"Criticism of this book is tempered by keeping one important fact in mind; I found all that I needed to begin developing and customizing WorldSoftware applications without the need for formal J.D. Edwards education. So, the author did a thorough job while sometimes wasting words on overblown praise for the product, overemphasizing the value of the report writers, and repeating his confusing practice of picking topics up in the middle, only to provide the necessary information later. I don't have a similar book to compare it to but I must admit that this one is all that I have needed thus far."
4,THE REVIEW,"This movie gave me an idea of what it was like for Irish immigrants who worked in the coal mines. It conveyed the horrible conditions that the workers had to endure. It portrayed the secret society of the Molly Maguires very well. You could see both points of view, the coal miners and the owners and police. I thought the movie was very educational, while it lacked excitment."
2,Not good enough for the price,"These headphones are OK but I have 2 main problems - the fit is poor and I have a hard time keeping them on my ears. Also, they cut out constantly. I think if you plan to sit still and use them it might be OK but I find them constantly cutting out when I am moving around trying to do yardwork, walk, ski, etc. Seem to have a conflict when they come near anything else electrical. Great idea, poor execution and quality."
4,Nice CD!! Avril IS COOL.....,"Loved this album!! Songs were all really well written, and you can tell she will be a fantastic artist in years to come!!! You wont be disappointed."
1,Defective after 5 months - cannot return it,"I loved this clock for the first week, then I started noticing the time would always be either behind or ahead, no matter how often I updated it to sync with any other clock. That did not bother me though because I purchased it mainly for the radio and the sound therapy. Now, 5 months later, the clock goes completely out and it will not turn on at all unless I mess with it for about 20 miniutes. Eventually it will work but it is inconsistent."
4,What a Doll!!,"And what a fun movie.Star of The Parent Trap,Lindsay Lohan,stars as a motherless child,who is given a fashion doll for her birthday.Magically,the doll comes to life,and befriends the lonely little girl.There isn't a great storyline but it is a great movie all the same."
3,New Guy,"hmmm, it was that good, kinda disappointing, i was up for so laughs but got about 5 out of the whole movie."
3,"a very high quality, comfortable, ugly sneaker","The last pair of steve maddens I had lasted for years, and I'm sure this pair will too. They are very comfortable, and very high quality. But I think the design, especially on the top is kind of ugly, and had I seen them in the store I wouldn't have bought them. Stylistically, there is just too much going on...and in real life the shoe just looks like a messy design trying to pass itself off as stylish"
4,Excellent,"Except for the fact that a scanned text document output in PDF takesa very large space, everything else was fine, and Iam very happy with mypurchase"
3,"some okay, others disappointing","The first two movies were just okay. As other reviewers reported, there are few scenes of Roy and Johnny. The greatest rescues are a highlight of some of the rescues from the seasons of the show so all about the two and the original cast. The two movies based in San Francisco seem kind of out of order because they are not captains yet; but they are in the movie more than the first two movies. They only help with the rescues though. The ratio of them in the scenes is about the same as the series when they divided the time between the hospital and the rescues. As others reported, the crew of 51 are not in the movies except for the ""greatest rescues"" because they are the flashbacks of previous rescues. All in all, if you love Emergency! you may want this to complete your collection, but don't expect the same as from the series."
3,Two chargers DOA,"We purchased 5 extra handsets for other rooms in the home. The phone itself is great, has great features, sound quality, speaker phone, etc. HOWEVER, two of the handsets we purchased had dead chargers, that is, they won't charge the phones. So, now we have two phones who don't have their own charger which means we have to switch and swap the phones in other rooms before the charges run out. We are in contact with Customer Service to see if we can resolve this, but I did want to warn would be purchasers of this possible problem.UPDATE: We contacted customer service and they sent us two new chargers via Fed Ex."
1,IT WAS A BORING AND DULL BOOK!,It was not very intersting at all . A five year old could read it and it would be boring to them. Instead of having it recommended for 7th graders it should be for a 5th grader. We are to advansed for that book.
5,We love our Kindles!,Keep going Kindle team! We love what you're doing. Can't wait to see what you come up with in the future. Our purchase of books has already taken a big jump - and it was big before. We finally don't have to plan an extra wing on the house to store them all!
1,ZZZZZZZ,"Boring, boring boring!! Read 'Brave New World' instead. Brave New World is better written and much more interesting."
1,"Hate to admit it, but not good..","And I REALLY wish they were! I love EVERYTHING about them other than the fact that I have bought about 5 of these two packs, and it never fails that ONE of the two leaks. The little inserts come out so easily. I have a 2 year old and a 1 year old so I need something that can take a few hits here and there. They are just such a hit and miss. If it was ONE out of all five packages, I could understand...but 50% bad...not good."
5,This book rocks!,"I've read this book and it is awesome. If you want a different slant on the world than those given by the liberal media outlets, this is the book for you. If you like the book, check out the syndicated radio show, which airs all over the U.S."
3,"Fair History, Undermined by Dimestore Psychology","Braxton Bragg's campaign into Kentucky in the late summer and early autumn of 1862 is an often neglected chapter in Civil War history. Noe's book is a thorough exploration of the campaign based on use of primary and secondary sources. While a solid account, the author's digressions into retrospective psychoanalysis are a bit silly and lessen the credibility of the book as serious history. Nevertheless, it is worth reading. Like many university press histories, however, it is degraded by poor maps. The award of three stars is just a little bit generous. It's really a two and a half!"
4,Tis a good one!,"1st of all, it's a shame that Rancid had to ""prove themselves"" after thsi album and what's more a shame is that they FELT they HAD to. To me that borders on selling out. Selling out doesn't have to do with money.With that aside, I love reggae and I love (real) punk rock. So of course, I like this album a lot. I'm not sure which is my favorite, this or ...And Out Come the Wolves. I think Wolves.In regards to my 1st statement, I have listened to the 2000 ST album one time and haven't picked it up since. I'm sure i will at another time and I'm sure I'm now thought of a trendy Rancid listener. Grow up."
2,Very unlikeable main character.,"I realize this book is supposed to be humorous as well as a realistic portrayal of a rich girl whose most inner thoughts are discovered, but I found Harriet's actions to be more irritating than funny. Yes, there are a few laughs and the author tells a good story, but it's hard to get by the fact that Harriet would be hated in most schools because of what she thinks of others, and because she is a spoiled BRAT. All she thinks about is herself, and acts like a jerk when Ole Golly leaves. I don't have the least bit of sympathy for this whiner. There are a lot of cruel things said and done to people in this book, and the Janie character wanting to blow up the school seems to be inappropriate in today's day and age, since kids are actually doing that and it's not funny anymore. Sorry if you liked this book. I didn't. (The movie was actually better.)"
4,Probably best for 3+ year olds,"My near 2 1/2 year old likes this video more than I do, probably because I was expecting something different based upon previous reviews I read. There ARE a lot of trucks shown, but some of it is quick footage, and there is also a share of non-driving footage that makes my son say ""scoop truck, Mama, scoop truck!"", meaning he wants to see TRUCKS--not surveyors, the control room of a gravel yard, or several replays of a hill being blown up. The music is also corny and somewhat annoying for adults. Having said this, I must say the video is educational and probably best for a 3+ year old who understands more of the narrative."
4,Pretty good envelopes,"These are good heavy weight envelopes 24# and they take laser print very well, for the price they are a good buy. I just wish they had been security tinted, but with their thickness it appears this may not be a problem."
1,Diesel 10 Means Trouble,"I completely agree with ""mtr22's"" review of the book. Diesel 10 is scary in the book and the author uses the word ""hate""...not something I want to teach my 3-year old. After reading it once, I returned it to the store (I didn't purchase it from Amazon)."
4,spiritual journey in a gangster novel,"I think Michael Ventura had to use the context of a crime novel to get his story published. However, this novel is really a journey of his own self-discovery. He reminds me of Herman Hesse in the way he constantly enters and exits different doors in his own psyche -- almost at random. The central character, Mike Rose, has a mentally ill older brother. So does Ventura. Avid readers of Ventura's essays know this, and it is very easy for said readers to imagine that Mike Rose is Ventura. If you just want a murder mystery, this won't work for you unless you are particularly daring -- and patient. But, if you like to see someone get to the heart of himself, take a chance. You might be blown away by Ventura's prose. Light reading, this is not, but it is very interesting."
1,Blue ant super tooth,"This is a great handfrees device, we bought three for our company trucks and locomotives and they work great, good clear sound and when talking the person on the other end say the sound is very clear, great battery life and simple to use"
5,Made me want to be a better person,"When I read a book and/or see a movie that inspires me, I want to become a better person. Everyone should be so lucky to have a person love them just a fraction of the time this story tells. This is the best love story I have ever seen. It inspired me to look at my life and remind myself how very lucky I am, as well."
1,AVOID THIS BOOK!,"I am not the type that easily/frequently predicts endings . . . but this book is transparently predictable. The 5oo pages could be covered simply enough in 100 pages. Formulaic, dull, uninspired. Like so many other recent reviewers, I ask: why is this book popular?"
2,This wasn't the solution I was looking for.,"I bought this watch to count my steps so that I'd have a better idea of my activity during the day. The problem is that if I sit down at my desk, it will sense that I'm not being active and turn the counter off. That's not really helpful.Also, the display is very, very confusing. You have to cycle through 20 different screens to find the one you want. I keep the manual on the kitchen counter because I have to read the complicated directions every time I want to make any changes. All in all, I wasn't very happy with this product."
5,Great explanation of political ecology,"As a professional in the environmental area in Central America, I applaud Vandermeer and Perfecto's explanations of the workings of man in the humid tropical forests of our region. These are not easy issues, yet they manage to leave the reader with a sense of the urgency without oversimplifying or becoming preachy. This book is best for someone who is really interested in the political ramifications of US policy in the tropics, or for someone interested in working in the environment overseas."
1,"beware, ricardo warranty service is terrible","The bags might be good looking and they MIGHT last for 10+ years, however, if you ever require customer service regarding a warranty claim, good luck at getting your bag fixed or replaced. I have been dealing with Ricardo for going on 3 months and the only thing they have done is read my emails. When I finally got a response, the customer service rep said he was mailing me a bag of comparable value and quality. I got the bag, however the features of the bag I received as a replacement in no way compare to the bag they know I have. As a result I have a bag that is broken, and now another bag I won't use... I would rather take my chances with another company's products and customer service than Ricardo. Additionally, don't be fooled, Vera Bradley is made by the same company. Check out who you are dealing with before you make the same mistake I did. If there were zero stars I would rate them as zero."
2,Rubber is cheap and breaks down,"The contstruction and ease of use is very good with a pickup truck. Loved it for the first few years. However, the rubber material that the tube frame of the bike actually rests on does not hold up. I've had mine for a few years but really haven't used it that much and the rubber loops where the straps go through are all coming off. This will eventually lead to the inability to secure the bikes."
3,Flawed but still the best,This book is wildly overpriced. The Urdu typeface is not friendly to the beginner. There are many discrepancies between the written text and what is read on the CDs. It's too obvious that the speakers are reading. Needed more voices to be realistic. There are errors and inconsistencies in the transliteration. There is far too much English on the CDs.Hower: It's the only Urdu text worth considering. The explanations are good and anyone who persists with this book will learn Urdu.
1,Lolita DVD,This DVD was not formatted to play on players in the USA. Next time I will check it out before I buy.!
3,Jack Clement at it again...,"Well, tarnishing Townes' first album, For the Sake of the Song, with overproduction and inappropriate arrangements was not enough for Cowboy Jack. No, he had to do the same thing, although in a little different manner, with different instruments, to At My Window. Before, it was mostly drums and percussion. This time Clement enlists the aide of the sax and flute and uses them in very distasteful arrangements. Almost every song after track 3 is marred. Clement should have learned his lesson the first time-Townes's songs should stand on their own. However, the poor production does not completely destroy the album and Townes songs still shine, albeit with just a little less lustre. While I wouldn't use this album to initate a new TVZ fan, it is still a welcome addition to the TVZ catalogue."
5,"Wonderful, moving story!",An excellent story with many emotional events. The story fellows a lifetime and is truly wonderful reading material!!
3,mediocre pic quality,"I just want to say that I agree with the reviewer, C. Caroll. To the reviewer who inferred that C. Caroll did not read the manual correctly, you are wrong. Indeed the photos are full 5MP, but if you zoom in on them, and you will see a definite lack of clarity, and elements of compression. They almost look like impressionist paintings when you zoom in. I bought this camera for the size and the low-light capabilities, and it met my expectations in that regard. But I am disappointed with the picture quality."
4,Gaudi's work speaks for itself.,"The beauty of this film is that there is little dialog. This isn't a biography in the traditional sense, which is what I loved about it. It follows Gaudi's career through the evolution of this architecture. It's a brilliant approach. The Criterion addition also includes a BBC bio, but the host can't see beyond his personal religious upbringing, that is definitely gets in the way of a bio of Gaudi. I have a long time fan of Gaudi, he was one of a kind, his work has never been replicated and he did it on a scale that couldn't happen again. Fascinating."
5,Music of the Angels CD,"I put this CD in my clock radio aside of my bed. When I can't sleep at night I listen to the calming sounds of the harp, flute and soothing voices. I usually do not make it to the end of the CD before I fall asleep."
3,Too many styles,"I ordered this CD after having heard several cuts from ""Fisherman's Blues,"" such as ""Sweet Thing,"" ""A Bang on the Ear,"" and the title track. I knew that the emsemble evolved through different styles in these ten years, but boy howdy, I didn't know just how much it evolved. The first several tracks are brash college-band tunes, albeit with Scott's more mature touches. I only enjoyed the more Celtic and folk flavored later tracks, and I therefore find myself skipping through the CD quite a bit. That being said, if you dig the early INXS sound, the earlier efforts are superb. The CD is absolutely an accurate representation of the group's music from '81 to '91, it just wasn't quite what I had hoped. The Waterboys just went through too many phases growing up. Caveat Emptor."
4,Arrived as described,"This power cord appears to be a bit more flexible than the cord that was supplied with the original unit (a good thing). We'll hope that this one lasts a bit longer, but so far I'm pleased with the performance."
2,Where the hell?,"I have to agree with what someone said about this not being a complete Keith Sweat package. Keep It Comin, Just A Touch and And I'm Dreamin were indeed huge hits that recieved massive radio airplay, and were very popular. The CD just doesnt seem complete w/o those missing songs."
5,Great duo - Clapton & JJ Cale,"The music is great if you like either or both of these guys. Early reviews has it EC had to add JJ since most were Cale's tunes. That being said, the two are great together and there are several really catchy tunes you'll play in your head all day long. Highly recommended..."
3,Not the best in the series,"I have to say this book disappointed me. We're used to Gabe being an adolescent jerk, but he has grown to have so many rotten characteristics, you have to wonder why a supposedly smart woman like Benni even sticks with him. He's supposed to be some brooding mystery man always on the verge of an emotional breakthrough, but basically he's just a verbally abusive guy who is always dismissive of anything Benni does. And in return, Benni fawns all over him, still mesmerized by how sexy he is. Puh-leeze. In the real world, no smart woman would think his constant nastiness would be remotely sexy. The plot was okay but pretty easy to figure out, and I missed reading more about Dove and Emory. Elvia just came off as a shallow nitwit, which was also disappointing."
3,Wanted more,"I guessed the twist too early and it ruined the story for me. Also I truly enjoyed the style of writing, I wanted something more. I was a little hungry while reading."
2,Good coverage but *very* poorly edited.,"I find this book useful but I have to rate it unacceptable for all but the *very* determined reader. It is loaded with typographical errors rendering formulas wrong, numerical examples wrong, etc... Really infuriating and unacceptable. I sent e-mail to the publisher complaining and they said ""oh, the copy editor on that book quit."" No errata sheet available.Caveat emptor."
1,Bootleg Headband,"This headband sucks!! its not the official one. Its too small for my head. Its supposed to be blue, not black. I'm currently using it as a collar for my dog and thats the only cool thing about it. I'm trying to find a real one in time for this costume party im going to. Plz help!"
3,A touch on the surface.,"I must admit that with every new book this author writes, the better his depth and subject matter. Although still basic in scope (which is why he has to write so much), he explains in layman's terms what his mission in life is. I personally like a thorough reading over the ""super easy"" which is why this book does not break the 4 barrier. It is a quick read if you're on a plane and need some closure while reading."
4,Works great,"My girlfriend and I both have iPhones (4,3GS) so that's why I got the two port car charger. I was a little skeptical, because of the price but plugged it in and worked like a charm, so when we travel there is no conflict for charging our phones. The only real negative is that is kinda bulky."
1,Young's Analytical Concordance to the Bible,"The concordance is only useful if you have ""Young's Literal Translation of the Holy Bible."" The bible is nothing more than his attempt to produce a translation as different from the KJV as possible. After reading his prefaces, I got the impression that he had a bone to pick with the KJV and/or was tweaking the proponents of the KJV at the time of his authorship. The concordance is incomplete, not user friendly, and just about useless."
5,amazing,i bought this item yesterday at Mad Marks in bradenton fl it blew my mind away for 250watts peak it sounded amazing but wat im seeing that is different from online n in store is that i bought them cheaper in the store than online but i would deffinitly recommend them
2,Misleading title and mostly fluff,"When I bought this book, this was the only Peoplesoft book around. The author seems to spend more time in trying to tell readers of this book how to treat a consultant, most of the book is fluff, however it does give some basic information on the company, and its origins and some of its cult like behaviour.Im still waiting for a good book on Peoplesoft that actually covers financials like the Oracle financials handbook written by David James and Graham Seibert.However as an independent consultant, I do like the fact that he asks to treat us with awe and work the employees schedules around us (honest thats what he says)."
5,Pero,"We love the taste of Pero. It is the perfect substitute for coffee with or without cream. We recommend it highly to anyone who wants to give up coffee and the caffeine associated with it, but wants to enjoy a cup of coffee in the morning or any other time during the day."
2,Just Read It at the Book Store,"I have a three and five year old. I picked up the book to preview it before making the purchase. I'm glad I did. It sounded hilarious, but fell short of expectations. I felt it was not at all original. The story was almost the same as ""Dog Breath"" by Dav Pilkey (which my kids enjoy). So I wasn't as charmed by the story. I noticed other reviewers made this observaton too.Also, I'm okay with the occasional potty-humor, but this book is a little over-the-top. The word, ""fart"" is mentioned so frequently it got tiresome to read. Before you make the purchase, might I suggest, if you're buying this book for children who can't read yet, you might want to THINK how you feel about reading ""FART"" OUT LOUD over and over again at story-time.If you're OK with that, and you've never read ""Dog Breath"" this might be one to add to you're collection. I did like the illustrations, but decided to pass on the purchase."
5,Lightning Across the Pages,"I don't know how a reader of this brilliant work could consider it stodgy and predictable as some dolt observed in a review printed above. This work moves like a bolt of lightning across the page. The plot and characters grabbed me by the throat from the first chapter and didn't let up until it ended. What delicious torture. Garcia-Roza's detective protagonist is wonderfully fresh and human, unlike any principal character I've encountered in the detective genre. I've read all of the work in this series save two. and I can't wait to get my hands on them.George GilbertSan Francisco"
4,Hard to get use to!!!!,"I heard an import copy in a Japanese CD Shop. I must admit I expected more. I am more of a fan of their style when they made the first two albums. There is considerable growth displayed by the band members in this cd. But if you are an old school GC Fan then you mostly will have issues adapting to their new sound. I give them credit for being brave enough to venture from their successful formula on the first 3 albums that brought them into the light. Now we shall see if they lead the groups like them (Sum 41, Simple Plan, etc.) into a new age of punk/pop or if artists like fall out boy have taken the lead and GC heads down a road on its own."
3,"Great hydrating cream, but not for keratosis pilaris","This is the first time trying this cream...I specifically bought this to treat keratosis pilaris, which it didn't clear it up at all. I think I will stick to kp duty for keratosis pilaris."
1,not good as a learning tool,"This book is not good as a learning tool, it only gives 1 or 2 words of translation per page."
1,Don't Buy This Garbage!!!,Very disappointed in this product. Made sure the battery compartment was securely closed and lowered it in 2' of water. Went out to check on it three hours later and saw no light. Pulled it up and water had gotten into the battery compartment and shorted everything out. Worst piece of garbage I have ever bought on Amazon.
3,Some Glimmers,"I did take something useful out of this book. Basically, it heightened my awareness about how to communicte effectively with different personality types. Not that this is something particularly new--I doubt there is anything new in the book--but I found it useful to present information differently to introvert and extrovert types, and I also practice occasional ""mirroring"". The advice on diet, however, is in my opinion, flawed. This book will not change your life, but it is an easy, and sometimes informative read, even if most proposed solutions are manifestly too facile to be true."
3,Recipes and menus nearly impossible for a single person,"There is a lot of excellent information in the book, perhaps worth the price alone. However, I purchased it looking forward to having a month's worth of recipes and menus to follow. Most of the recipes are for 4 servings, some for 2. And the author admits they are nearly impossible to cut in half. Since we are told it is essential to follow the daily menus exactly to benefit from Whitaker's program, the book is nearly useless for a single person living alone.The book is a major disappointment."
2,what time is it ???,"I would have put 5 stars if the Atomic part worked.Since they changed the timing of the daylight savings time this year 2007, the clock was not able to get the right time. I have to manually adjust it, and cannot get it to move past 8 am. Unfortunately, I have to order another one as it belongs in a conference room opposite end from the other one."
5,Must have DVD!,"This is one of the DVDs in my collection that gets played over and over again. It is such a wonderful film. If you have a large screen television or better yet, a front projector, this is a must have. It is so beautiful. The narration, the cinematography, the music, the story, the nature are wonderful."
3,Fiary Tales and Children,"This book does an excellent job exploring the interest children have in fairy tales and why they connect so easily with this genre. The book investigates when a child's interest is at its peak pertainng to fairy tale and the connection between his life and the fairy tale. Fairy tales symbolize a child's conception of the ""real"" world. The author does an outstanding job examining why children are so attracted to the predictability of fairy tales, many having happy endings where the ""good character"" ends up on top. Good book for research on several different topics pertaining to children and fairy tales."
4,Good so far,"When the item arrived, there appeared to be oil leaking out of the unit and the inside of the box had a large oil stain. So far it has not seemed to be a problem.I got this to partially drain my pool for winterization. I have only used it once but it did the trick. It took a while but there is only so much volume you can push through a garden hose size opening."
4,Very good.,"There are some interesting ideas in this book. I have found some of her suggestions quite useful.As a creative person, I found this book resonated with me."
4,My Daughter Loves This Video,"My 3 year old daughter loves this video. She hasn't even seen all the movies, but she loves her princesses. Great product!"
3,Up's and downs,I got this game for Christmas and well let's just say it's not a must have. If you have brothers and or sisters or people that you have to play it with you. Other than that I can tell you that it's not worth the money maybe half the price or about $35.00. But if you want to spend your money on it go ahead!
1,Boring!,Kind of a sweet movie but poorly written...a real yawner! would not buy again...rated too high for me by a long shot! Grandma might have liked this movie! I am a normal regular kind of person and don't need big action and violence..but this movie isn't worth bringing out at Christmas time for the family to watch!
5,Powerful lessons! This film should be shown in classrooms everywhere!,"Not only is this a great piece of entertainment, but it also has some profound lessons to teach especially in our current state of world affairs. If only every world political leader, religious leader and even community leaders could heed the lessons from this film. It's a powerful reminder of the importance of laying aside hatred and replacing it with tolerance. We can belong to different tribes and cultures and yet view those differences as opportunities to learn from each other without having to resort to racism, bigotry and war. The film also teaches us that religion can be good, but we shouldn't fear putting aside old beliefs that no longer serve us and which only cause harm and injury to others in the name of God. This film would be a powerful teaching aid and springboard for some great classroom discussions on all of these topics."
5,One of the best ever...,"I would assume that by now few are unfamiliar with the look at Americana-suburbia. I watched this movie again over the weekend; this is the 1st time I have seen it since before the 72nd Academy Awards. Despite having now seen this movie almost a dozen times, I realize that it just gets better with each viewing. The only unfortunate thing that I can say that is related the movie is that it is unfortunate that Sam Mendes didn't approve DreamWorks to include the original ending on the DVD (showing a court scene)."
1,CAUTION NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION,"I needed this for a special Iranian Recipe our dinner club assigned me. Bought it from the foods section, right on the bottle it says not to be ingested or swallowed. CAUTION DO NOT USE FOR FOOD! ! !"
5,Love it,I love bare minerals. I usually get med beige with a yellow undertone. This med is a pink undertone. I have to mix it with a little of the warm color I have but for the price it was worth it!
5,Health! Health! Health!,"Who said exercise is easy? I've just finished the workout and I feel great! I had a hip operation 7 weeks ago and haven't had any aerobics since. Before my surgery I was swimming for 40-60 minutes a day. So I was starting to feel yucky, depressed. Nikki is a good teacher, energetic, and easy to follow.Sometimes I couldn't keep up with her. No problem. I just did what I could. Nevertheless I got a good workout and am ready to face the day with energy."
1,Save yourself now and run,"Apparently, humor and originality are seemingly replaced by the bizarre and the boring. It was silly, incoherent and painful to watch. If you find things to be interesting because they are strange, then go for it. If you're looking for intelligent humor that is understandable, run now and save yourself."
2,Difficult to attach.,Nothing wrong with this bracket if you do not mind the hassle of attaching the binoculars to it. The stem for the bolt which attaches to the binocular is way too short to allow ease of tightening.
2,Fails to meet Sony design standards and warranty support,This product is not designed or built to the usually high Sony standards. The LCD screen WILL break under normal use and Sony will not honor the warranty if the screen fails. My screen failed after six months and I returned the computer to Sony for repairs. Sony charged me over $700 and refused to return the 'physically damaged screen' as I requested so that the 'intentional damage' that I 'caused' could be verified. To confirm that this is a design flaw Sony included with the repaired computer NEW instructions as to how to prevent damaging the screen noting that 'the LCD screen may be sensitive to pressure or added stress'. This product is a sad commentary on Sony's design standards and on its unwillingness to stand behind its warranty.
2,Dirt Devil Hand Vac,"This is one of the better hand vacs...it has pretty good pick up. It has an attached crevice tool which is nice but you need to be careful when using it so that it does not break off.Update...I wrote the first review when the vac was new. In the long run, the battery does not hold its charge even after sitting on the charger for a few days. So, even though it picked up items, what good is it when the battery has no power and the vac won't work because there is no suction?"
1,Crashes on ipad 2,"La Sainte Bible crashes on Ipad 2, which I understand is common for this book on Ipad 2. I got no reply from Amazon when I inquired about it."
2,Strictly for children...,"...worse still; for politically-correct parents who think cultures must be sterilized. Lots of pictures but the word ""beer"" is never mentioned. What sort of Oktoberfest book is that?"
1,"This camera is horrible, don't waste you money",This camera is not worth the $20.00 that I spent for it. The pictures are blurry. You can't made out what so of them are half of the time. Don't buy this camera if you are looking for quality good pictures.
1,Zero Stars Doesn't Seem to Be an Option,"As the old adage tells us, ""If you can't say something good, then don't say anything at all.""With that in mind, since a review would be pointless if I said nothing, I must obviously say something positve about ""Skills of the Vagabonds.""Hmmm....let me think a moment. OK, ""Skills of the Vagabonds"" gave me my first opportunity to try out Amazon.com's return policy.Oh my, I'm feeling generous now that I realize I will be able to recoup some of my losses. Here's another positve thing about ""Skills of the Vagabonds"": the cover art is not terrible.That pretty much exhausts the positive aspects of this book, so I shall say nothing more."
1,Ralph Paul,"I thought i was getting the DVD collection, recieved VCR tape. I guess i will be ordering again. You need to be more specific on the details."
4,Fun with Agility,I really like this book - it is very informal and has great ideas. I just wish it had more information on how to make your own equipment. Don't want to compete with my dog - we just want to have some fun and this book has been a great help.
3,comfortable but it slips,"This lumbar support is comfortable, if a little soft (my physical therapist recommended a much firmer pillow-- this is a bit softer than an aeron chair). However, the elastic strap to affix it to the chair is really stretchy and is not adjustable, so it keeps creeping lower and lower into the chair's space between the back & the seat. This reduces the effectiveness dramatically and i'm always having to slide it back up the back of the chair. Annoying!"
1,Don't waste your money,"Poor little Missy. Even the title is distorted: don't you actually have to PASS training in order to BE a fighter pilot? As for making history, she made it, and all of it bad for women in the military. This story didn't play in the Department of Defense (or Congress) and I guess everyone was in on the conspiracy. Now she's peddling her story to the public. Funny that plenty of women are fighter pilots today and were before Ms. Cummings, so why not Missy? Could it be lack of skill? Since she slams the investigation by the Inspector General, get the true story and ask the Navy IG for the Cummings investigation under the freedom of information act open to all Americans. You decide what's true."
2,Does Not Fit 2005 Subaru,"This sensor appears to be good quality, but it DOES NOT fit my 2005 Subaru Legacy (non-turbo, 2.5L 253J engine). Although the Bosch site shows it as the proper sensor pre-catalyst, it is not. The NTK/NGK 24696 fits perfectly. The connector and overall length are different, so they are definitely not the same. The NTK site matches a different Bosch sensor to the 24696."
1,Parents Beware!!!,"If you care about your kids, you will not let them read this shallow, superficial, morally bankrupt series. These books are void of anything edifying or appropriate not just for teenage girls, but for anyone period. Don't support this kind of worldly sludge that only serves to lower the standards of young people and compromises their opportunity for real happiness --- This envious escapism is HARMFUL!"
1,Very disappointed,"I owned this TV for a little more than 3 years, before the LCD panel burned out, rendering it useless (since the repair would have cost a lot more than a new TV.) On average, LCD TVs are supposed to last about 100,000 hours. I watched mine maybe 2 hours a day on average, so I'd estimate that the TV lasted about 2200 hours. Not what I expected from Sony. The faulty LCD panel is a known issue: there was even a recall on the 46 inch model. I called Sony, but they wouldn't do anything for me except offer me another TV - a 40 inch, which I didn't want - at a bit of a discount. I bought a new Samsung instead.Sony used to make quality products. No more, it seems, judging by the number of one-star reviews I see for their TVs.Yes, the picture was great while it lasted. But it didn't last long."
4,educational,"I would have given the book 5 stars but the author was so good at portraying the boring training sessions, I soon grew bored of the redundant stories of the training session. However I thoroughly enjoyed the rest of the book and the insights into how human ego and human error bring about unintended consequences all in the pursuit of greed. Michael's honesty about his salary in proportion to his expertise is refreshing. I would recommend this to a friend."
5,his 'introspective' best,"i can relate to those who see seal as a melodic pop meister, judged by his previous records. but this record lets us know he can create from within, his emotional best."
4,Superb acting thru horror.,The movie was good in that it exposed the Organization for it's villany and the horror in which it inflicks onto others. The actors superbly showed how people do really act in real life.
1,This is my last Anita Blake...,"As I said in my one-star review of Anita Blake #9, Obsidian Butterfly, if the next book in the series wasn't better edited, I was done, done, done. So, here is #10, and it is even more poorly edited (typos, repetitive scenes, and overly-long descriptions - how many times do we need to hear about Nathaniel's ankle length hair?), but even worse, there was no story arc. Really, no plot...nada, none, zero. Anita moves from violent episode to violent episode, and from sexual encounter to sexual encounter (wash, rinse, repeat MANY times), but there is no plot to hook it all together. The final straw is the insertion of a whole new villian in the last few chapters! I won't be reading any more of the Anita Blake series, and, given that I couldn't get past Chap 6 of the first book in LKH's Merry Gentry series, it looks I'm done with LKH as an author."
3,You get what you pay for,Its basicly a toy. But it would be good to have in your purse or clove box for quick access in situations! The battery lasts a vary long time.It would be a very good tool for kids projects.
2,Nice looking shoe but uncomfortable,Might be a sizing issue. I tried the size 10 and it was big enough that my heel kept sliding out. The 9.5 fits but really hurts around the toes. I now have beautiful looking & expensive shoes that I never wear as a result. :(
4,A good book,I think this was a good book. Amy can't wait for her 13th b-day but when she wakes up that day something happens to the way she looks and she misses her big b-day party because of it...
5,VERY funny - I keep having to buy it - if you lend it out you'll never see it again!,"Am buying this for perhaps the fifth time. Great series from the UK and Ireland. Three priests (not very good ones!) are exiled to Craggy Island for their misdemeanors and live together in a parish house. This series is about their lives and times. Catholic friends from Ireland, Austria, Germany, and New York all have loved this show. I bet you will, too!"
1,Complete Tripe,If you enjoy TRL this one is for you. Otherwise move on and find something interesting to listen to. Jimmy and Britney would make a great pair wouldn't they?
5,Beautiful and dreamy,"One of the editorial reviewers used the word ""gauzy"", which describes it well. Can be read and reread. A nice bed side book for house guests."
5,Great cardio workout,"This is a great cardio workout. It reminds me of aerobic/kick boxing type class in the gym, but she has her own twist on exercise. I own 4 of her DVDs and love all of them. This is the hardest workout of them all. If you do them on a regular basis, you will definitely see results that others notice and want! The Yoga segment is definitely enjoyable to strengthen your core muscles. A great contrast to the cardio workout. I would definitely recommend!"
2,Amazing Or Horrible,"This film is creepy. Could you imagine continuing to be in a band/family with a stranger who had plastic surgery to look like your friend?To act like this cover up is normal, and not entirely sick is....sickening.Much of the evidence seems like a stretch. MI5 threatens to kill the Beatles of they tell, but they don't want to tell bc of the suicides? How many suicides would happen if the entire band was wacked? lol Major flaw in plot.Almost had me for a minute."
3,"SHOES GREAT, SERVICE NOT!!!","I HAVE BEEN WAITING ON THESE SHOES TO GO ON SALE, FINALLY THEY DO AND I ORDER MY SIZE BUT WHEN I GET MY SHOES THEY WERE THE WRONG SIZE, THE ORDER FORM AND THE BOX THE SHOES WERE IN HAD THE CORRECT SIZE BUT THE SHOES THEMSELVES WERE A HALF SIZE SMALLER.......SO WHERE IS MY SHOE!!! THE SIZE I NEED WAS NO LONGER AVAILABLE ONCE I ORDERED THEM...SO WHERE ARE THEY!!! I CALLED C.S. AND ADVISED OF THE ERROR AND WAS TOLD MY SIZE MAY/MAY NOT BECOME AVAIL LATE OCTOBER!! WHAT SERVICE, HAD SOMEONE QUALITY CHECKED MY ORDER I WOULDN'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM."
5,Worth Ur Buckz!,"This story is beautiful and passionate. the heir 2 the throne of argone falls in love with a woman raised 2 b a nun. her twin sister is evil n tries 2 marry him. she is devastated, but will not give in 2 her twin's treachery...2gether the two will form a love so strong, that nothing can destry it..Madeleine Baker at her best..."
4,War Horse,"Absolutely loved the book. Courageous, heartfelt and truthful. An unbiased outlook on war, touching, men hardened by deprivation of war, reaching for one symbol of hope and recognizing in the war horse true valour.Read the book before yo watch the movie!"
1,Broken and cracked on arrival.,Very nice online but arrived with stress fractures in the plate and leg broken on the bowl that cut me taking out of the box. Merry Christmas.
2,"Content seemed great, but not explained in detail","When I first bought this book, I was very hopeful. The book seemed to cover a lot of relevant material, in a concise fashion. When I tried to read it however, I found it a little bit too much on the concise side. I have read very complicated books with a lot of math before, and I could follow them easier than this ""easy"" writing style. Almost every subject is covered in other books in more detail and better. Sometimes it's nice to have a simpler book which is an introduction, and that is what I was hoping for, but this just didn't do it for me.I donated the book to the library,as I felt I would never really get too much out of it. This didn't stop me from buying Mr. Razavi's ""Design of Analog CMOS ICs "" and I liked his tutorial in the IEEE Phase Lock Loop book he edited.I know he can do a better job."
2,Big disappointment,"I have been waiting for ""Quo Vadis "" on DVD for years to complete the "" Ben Hur"" , "" King of Kings "" trilogy. Considereing the stunningpresentation of ""King of Kings "" I was sure ""Quo Vadis was going to be on an equal par especially since it was remastered in an ultraresolution.What a disappointment. Image appeared flat and the technicolor was pale and lackluster. A far cry from the ""King of Kings"" presentation.I hope the blu ray disc due out for Easter is an improvement."
1,Failed after a month,I purchased this unit to trigger an Aoogah horn I mounted under the hood of my HHR. This unit failed after barely a month of use and not a lot of use. All tests point to the relay failing. I am looking at other manufactures for a better quality replacement.
5,Looks great,"This candle is the perfect style for my old Maine cape home. the best part is that you don't need to plug them in, they go on and off at the right times and they look great in my windows"
1,DOES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!! DON'T WASTE YOUR $,"[[ASIN:B000BPL0XA My Lines Are Concealed]THIS STUFF DID NOTHING FOR MY SKIN!!I'M 55 & I COULD TELL NO DIFFERENCE (NONE) THESE WOMEN THAT USED THIS & HAD GOOD REVIEWS MUST BE LIKE 20 YEARS OLD & PROBABLY DON'T HAVE ANY REAL PROBLEMS WITH THEIR SKIN, SUCH AS WRINKLES YET,BELIEVE ME I WISH IT WOULD WORK, THIS IS JUST ANOTHER ITEM THROWN IN MY DRAWER,A WASTE OF MONEY!!(My Lines Are Consealed Face Lift for A Day) HOW ABOUT RENAMING IT FACE LIFT FOR A SECOND) (IF THAT LONG)"
5,Can't help it - love this movie,Not for your children because of language and sexual situations. It is a clash of life style and life culture done with full humor.
1,You never know what lurks behind a pretty bookcover...,"I rate this book 1 Star solely because it is THANKFULLY a very fast read! I received this book as a gift, had never heard of it and naively assumed it was a sweet story about pretty little sprites like Tinkerbell! In reality it is a Victorian era girl's ""diary"" about ""faeries"" who she contends are all the blame for her infered sexual dallinces. I found nothing amusing between the pages- either handwriten or ""pressed""! The hideous drawings of flattened faeries must represent her repulsion of her own sexuality, men and love. That's all I got out of this book! On behalf of all beautiful angelic faced sprites, the only kind that truly exist of course,I not only condemn this book but most certainly would never recommend it for young readers- or anyone of any age for that matter! I suggest using it to stoke up a fire on a cold winter's night!"
1,Disappointing,"I am not an expert on the historical backdrop of the book. Even if one were to assume that the background the author provides is accurate, the book itself is very poorly written. The book feels like watching a really bad action movie. Each chapter in the book is approximately two pages in length. Furthermore, successive chapters are different threads in the plot. This leads to disruptions in your thought process.In my opinion, the hype surrounding this book is unwarranted and the book is certainly not worth a read."
3,Take it with a grain of salt,"It's not a *bad* book, and it certainly held my attention for several trips to the reading room, but as previously mentioned, the advice mostly boils down to ""watch your back and don't be a jerk."" I did enjoy the writing style, but was irked by its flaws, some minor--spelling expatriate ""expatriot,"" for one--and some major: the authors don't seem to understand the difference between ""automatic"" and ""semi-automatic"" weapons.Educational? Sort of. But certainly entertaining."
4,Cute but impractical,"This is a cute toy with many small accessories not mentioned in the product description. Each doll has a blanket, toothbrush and pillow as well as a mask that coordinates with her pajamas. There are little DVDs and popcorn, cookies, soda, cups (only three cups for five dolls, though).If you have a three year old like I do, the cute accessories will get lost within an hour. These dolls do not have brushes and their hair gets very frizzy quickly. The shoes are mule style and fall right off. It might not be easy to tell the racial variety of the dolls from the picture, but all but one are white, and the other is of ambiguous race. Living in an ethnically diverse community, I found this disappointing.All in all, it is a very cute set with many accessories and it is a very good buy. Be forewarned that is is very heavily packaged and you will spend at least half an hour freeing the dolls and accessories from the box. I would say this would be more accurately for 5+ instead of 3."
4,a little known gem,"When you think of Hammett, you probably think only of The Maltese Falcon and The Thin Man. The (great) movies probably play a role in that. But don't overlook The Dain Curse. It's fine reading for any crime novel fan.And a note to those whose reviews described the plot as choppy: this novel was originally published in three separate parts in one of the pulp magazines (anyone know which one? I don't recall) so all three parts were written to be part of a bigger story, yet be complete and self-contained in their own way."
5,This movie was the best one of them all.,"The remake of Night of the Living Dead 1990 was pretty good. But! Return of the Living Dead 2 was absolutely the best one. The makeup,and the zombies looked very convincing to me. I have to say though, I wasn't scarred. I used to work in a funeral home, and for a movie to frighten me it takes a lot of convincing.The effects were modern and very enjoyable. But, I still haven't seen a horror movie that has scarred the hell out of me yet. Never the less,I am still a big horror movie fan. And I will continue watching them untill I find the big one to ""scare the hell"" out of me. If anyone out there has any horror movie ideas for me, maybe there is one I missed. I have seen most of them, good and bad. Thanks"
4,replacement unit,Purchased as replacements for the original inverter supplied with the Thermo-King TriPac APU. Can not afford the Thermo-King units so we purchase these... just as good at less than half the price!!
2,overall unhelpful,"I bought this book used and found that it did a really poor job of pointing out the implications of the rules of evidence. Other than perhaps the difference between the common law and FRE, I found it to be too brief. I feel like there is little debate in evidence as to what the rules is, but rather, it is when it applies, which this book barely addresses. Try Emanuel's which gives detailed hypotheticals and examples."
3,"Entertaining for TV, but why are the lead female characters so stupid? :(","I found 24 to be very entertaining and fun to watch each season, but I found it very hard to stay interested when all the female characters outside of the CTU female characters are astoundingly lacking in any sense or intelligence, especially when stuck in dangerous or life threatening situations. They act like they have no brains and that is irritating. However, if you can ignore that really frustrating aspect to the show, the plot and other characters are very clever and interesting."
4,Great Crayons.,"I love these crayons. The hexagon shape means they won't roll of the table. They are thicker and longer than traditional crayons; less prone to breaking. The texture is somewhat soft which results in rich color. They show up well with colored construction paper.Unusual assortment of colors. For example, there are two shades of pink (but no true red), lt. green and teal, peach, yellow, a few shades of blue, a med. & dk. purple, white; no black or brown. I would have preferred a larger assortment of colors with some of the traditional colors included.One other note if you have dogs in the house: my dogs evidently love these crayons as much as I do. If they are left in their reach they devour them like they are a special treat. They leave other crayons alone."
5,A real good book for learning antenna theory,"This is a real excellent book for learning antenna theory. I enjoy this book very very much. By now I have not found for me another book that is better than this one, refer to antenna theory."
4,Stellar Dreams,"Over 50 years of vocal music is covered in this wonderful CD. Not since Judy garland has there been such a heart-wrenching renhition of ""Over the Rainbow"" - but the vocal quality is of a caliber never achieved by Garland. From ""I'll Be Seeing You"" to ""Waters of March"", her interpretations are warm and exciting. I rate it four stars rather than five only because I missed the lyrics in the CD jacket (which were included in her first CD 'Never-Never Land"", a 5 star if there ever was one). Try it you'll like it - and become addicted to Jane."
2,Should have listened,"I needed a garment rack for temporary use so I did not want to spend a lot of money. I came across the Whitmore Deluxe Adjustable Garment rack, read the good and bad reviews and decided to try it anyway, maybe I'll have good luck. No go. It has fallen at least 2-3 times. It's like a balancing act. I should have listened and kept the box to return it."
4,Cruelty invited from foolishness,"It read now though it bought at the great antiquity. analyzed it as it being a figure in which the children after the collapse of the 'bubble' economy grew up. It is very shocking and the heart has got dry.It think, when loneliness without a hero's place-to-go-to place and the figure which still do not face loneliness but for which it depends on others were very present-day Japan. This is a shocking work."
3,"Good, but I'd like articles that are more fun and less academic","I've only received one issue of the magazine so far. With a name like ""Bark,"" I was expecting more stories like you might find in People Magazine, only for dogs. Canine interest stories, I guess you could say. Instead, I found the articles to be somewhat dry and academic."
2,not worth it,I was very excited about buying this product to light up the pool during my son's birthday party but it didn't work very well. It is supposed to range from 10-15 feet but only ranges maybe 6-8 feet. Also has to be pitch black for it to work (somewhat dark is not enough for it to work at all).
5,Worth Training balls,My daughter is a catcher. We use the training balls to strengthen her arm (heavy ball) as well as increase her arm speed(light ball). So far so good. Quality product.
1,Disappointing,"Surely Mr. Gatto has stumbled upon something of importance, I don't deny that. Most readers though may find this book largely pointless because nothing is sourced.There is no bibliography. Quotations are not cited.For example I was reading on page 40 that Max Mason says the new education model is for 'the control of human behavior.' When I read this I thought ""wow that's interesting."" Then I proceeded to find the source of this claim. This is what I found on page 391:'Should I now attempt to dazzle you with this grotesque assemblage arranged into a formal bibliography. I'll concede it would hardly have been possible ...'Worthless."
2,Print is poor quality,"Content is fine. However, the quality of the printed text is poor. Letters in words are pinched and connected at the bottom in some areas. Some sentences have a wavy appearance as though the pages were a second generation copy. Text is readable just not what I was expecting for the price."
1,Disappointing!,"These radios are a disappointment! The batteries do not last through a 10 hour day, and I am reviewing the ones that come with the rechargeable battery pack and chargers. They last longer with rechargeable batteries, but then why did I pay for the battery packs and rechargers? Don't waste your money. If you can get the radios without the battery packs and chargers at a discount, then maybe go with them. Otherwise, don't buy them!"
1,VERY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND,"I used this book for my AP physics course. The idea of physics is to learn how to problem solve. This book would show you a few problems in the chapter and then dump a massive amount of problems on you at the end of the chapter with the answers for only the odd numbered problems, but those didn't have explanations! How can this book be helpful if there are no solutions. I wouldn't recommend this book...."
2,Not quite as bad as Amsterdam,"To start, I have read some of McEwan's novels and quite enjoyed them.Secondly, as in the review title, it doesn't quite reach the pits of Amsterdam (a poorly constructed sliver of a a book with insufficient characterization and not nearly enough about it to achieve anything near the suspension of disbelief necessary to carry the improbable plot line).This book falls into the category of those McEwan books where he's aimed for something like high art and fallen somewhat flat - a stream of consciousness narrative that seems intended to show everyone what a clever fellow he is.Parts are OK, and he is quite a clever fellow.Not so enjoyable, then, and a sudden and again hard to swallow denouement which doesn't sit well with the rest of the intellectualizing."
2,Missing features,"I upgraded from 2.x to 4.x and I've found that although 4.x adds some additional features, it is missing a way to batch convert my images. I contacted Olympus on this and they had no clue about anything. I'm disappointed but what are you gonna do?"
4,Very Good,"This book was equally, if not better than it`s prequel.After reading the first, I wasn`t to sure about reading the second after the first left me feeling pretty depressed, though I did it anyway and was greatly rewarded with a more upbeat book, compared to the first. Longtusk is better probably because of the less violence and a more descriptive plotline. The info on how the Mammoths live was riveting as was how they desribed the Neanderthals and early Homo-Sapiens.It was a great read.I eagerly await the third arriving."
4,"""We hope you never have to cross such a fence""","The blurb tells the expectant reader, after informing them that giving too many clues would spoil the reading of the book, and explaining only that they will go on a journey with Bruno who will sooner or later arrive at a fence.Thus I will also not give away more than that, but what an excellent idea and well executed too. Some have criticised the story for being unrealistic or unbelievable, but let us not forget that the subject mattter the story deals with itself is incredible, and yet the atrocities in it and worse have truly occurred in the history of our planet.As for the characterisation of Bruno, I believe that his innocence had to be exaggerated to achieve maximum impact, so one must allow for that artistic license.An easy and quick, but hard-hitting read.It worked for me."
3,"Great songs, good performances, bad recording","I must echo previous reviewers: The engineering on this live record is quite subpar. Instrumental balances are terrible. But enough of the negative.I saw the band live during this period and remember the experience as being awesome; Brooker played and sang his heart out, Wilson took drumming to a whole new level, and the rest of the band were tight and expressive. Here, however, the performances seem a tad off kilter. Not terrible, mind you, but perhaps the poor recording has something to do with this impression.In my opinion, this album is only for completists and collectors. For a true taste of this band's accomplishments on a live recording, get In Concert With the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra, where Procol Harum make it seem as if rock was meant to be played with a full orchestra and chorus."
4,Works Great! Just what I wanted...,"After reading all the mixed reviews on this product, I bought it anyway as it seemed the best deal for the amount of space I needed to humidify (1100- 1200 sf). I was pregnant and it was winter and I was getting pretty dehydrated from the drying heat in my apartment. Within days I was sleeping soundly waking refreshed and no longer having headaches. I would have given this 5 stars but it's the first I bought and I cannot make any comparisons.I am not sure what the reviewers that reviewed this product badly expected, having to refill it often just means that it is putting a lot of moisture into the air, the noise is not overwhelming and is similar to any white noise often used to put and keep kids asleep, I had no problem refilling it, my 2 year-old even liked to help, finally if you turn the filters faithfully once a week 2-3 filters should last the season."
3,Nothing Special,"I was really surprised to find myself considerably bored for a large portion of this book. Usually I love books like these: light, funny, and heartfelt. But, unfortunately, this book was none of those. I gave it 3 stars because it had its moments, but it was predictable and monotonous. I actually found the main character unlikable and quite mean at times. I never truly understood why she treated her mother like she did, and it was never portrayed clearly. I would recommend reading it from the library to see if it is your cup of tea before you buy it. I'm very glad I actually won this book in a contest rather than have spent $11 of my own money on it. Pick up ""Born Confused"" or something instead."
5,Awesome Game!,"This is probably my all time favorite car racing game. I LOVE IT! The only one that might be slightly better is the PSP version. But that's because I can take that version with me.But for gameplay on my 55 inch widescreen, this game is bomb baby!Very realistic! I love the custom soundtracks. I love to put in great smooth jazz and 80's hits, while I race around the roads, and run over other cars! It rocks!Buy this game, and enjoy videogaming for life!MC White said: Check it out!!! It rocks!"
3,seen better,i liked the movie i liked the way it had me on the edge of my seat but i have seen better movies
4,Another release from the NL,"Mac has finally dropped his first album and it's pretty good. Mac is recognizable as the only NL Soldier that is a stereotypically talented rapper. He has a smooth flow and it clashes with the guest rappers on a couple of tracks. One of the better songs is 'Paranoid'. Although it is an obvious rip-off of Geto Boy's classic 'Mind Playin Tricks on Me' it still works. The best track is 'Be All You Can Be' w/ Fiend, Silkk & Mo B. Dick. 'Wooo' & 'Murda Murda Kill Kill' are two other great tracks. Overall, it's worth the money for any rap fan out there."
1,why discarded this item,"I discarded this item because of the combination between the company name (dead on) and the company logo (skull and bones). It shouts ""DEATH"" all over.... may be I'd pay more attention if the company's name would be ""Live on"" :-)"
4,A true Legent.,"A Mahler 2nd that fits in a single CD is a rare beast. Mehta clocks it at just over 81 minutes (which make this one of the longest CDs in existance). So he has an edge on price. He also has an edge on performance. This is a great reading, truly electryfying. Vienna Philharmonic was in their best form during these concerts. The beggining of the symphony is fast, but you never get the feeling of hurried playing, just a tremendous drive. The sound quality is OK; had it been better, I would have given it 5 stars!"
2,Yuck - Get their eponymous debut instead,"I'm from New England and have dug these guys for awhile, and their first disc is among my faves. But - and I hate to say it - this record bores me. It lacks fire and punch. It sounds like an uninspired Mike Ness solo record. I don't know if it's the production or the new guitar player or the cliched lyrics or what, but this is just too smooth, like the Rev's last few attempts. I think they're still a great live band, but stuff like the hook on ""Chop Shop"" is just plain cheezy and the disc sounds like so many other neo-rockabilly bands, whereas they really used to have a harder, more distinctive sound."
2,Generic,"If there was ever a book that tried to teach you a formula for screenwriting, this is it. I've never understood the fascination with Syd Field by screenwriters. Some say this is the bible for screenwriters, but it really doesn't tell you much of anything. If you really want to learn about the art of scriptwriting, read Robert McKee's ""Story: Substance, Structure, Style, and the Principles of Screenwriting"". That will give you the deeper understanding of screenwriting you'll be lacking after Syd Field."
3,"Very cool, but...","I never thought the day would come when I would own Godflesh videos on DVD. Most of these were only available in PAL format from the UK and have never been seen overseas. I do have ""Crush My Soul"" on a Earache promotional tape previous to this. It's a great DVD, but, and I don't know if this is just my DVD, the video quality of ""Crush My Soul"" and ""Mothra"" are questionable. Electronic grain runs rampant through each video and I wonder if something happened in the re-mastering process. I compared my VHS tape version of ""Crush My Soul"" with the DVD version and it looks a lot cleaner. What's up with this? Anyone else have this problem? I've emailed Earache about it but no response so far."
5,Outstanding group and a great album,"I first ran across this group when I was stationed on Hawaii. There were quite a few groups that I had never heard of and Kalapana was one of those, but I soon was listening to their music whenever I could. Really worth your time. Great album."
5,Delightful,"""The Hobbit"" has to be one of my favourite books of all time (next to the ""Lord of the Rings"" series). It depicts the tale of a young (well, young for a hobbit which is about 50) hobbit which by chance becomes involved in an adventure, which is very un-hobbit like. And though Bilbo Baggins (the hobbit) complains endlessly and wishes to be back in his nice warm hobbit hole, he has the time of his life (well, maybe not the whole time) and forges strong friendships with elves, dwarves, men and wizards. Artfully written, it is a delightful tale which I will undoubtedly end up reading again and again."
1,"bad, bad..","Somehow, the combo got changed on mine, making for an interesting afternoon with a wire-cutters and then a locksmith.. Thankfully, Kensington paid me back, after saying that this problem came up a decent amount with this model... no good.."
3,"""Rocabilly Neil""","1 of Neil Youngs ""different style"" recordings. Music is a very personal choice though- ""listen & learn"" works best! The ""same ol' , same ol' "" isn't a learning experience!"
3,Short,"With such a small book you'd expect it to be straight to the point, but with this book it sometimes gets a bit repetitive. Personally, I enjoyed Paulo Coelho's ""Eleven Minutes"" more when it came to this topic of Love."
3,"Marvelous sound, but somewhat detached performance","This reading of the 8th is certainly nothing to scoff at, and Pentatone's SACD recording is very nicely done indeed. Good clarity and vivid sound, the rear surround speakers adding a much welcome presence and sense of space.The performance itself, while having a good sense of line is surprisingly detached and cool in its expression. This dark work veritably seethes with passions both brash and overt and more quietly menacing, with a range of dynamic emotion from resigned hush to climaxes that push the boundary of what can be tolerated... at least that is what the symphony can contain.. but little of this is really felt here.. The slower pacing does little to help this lack of incisiveness and emotional virulence.. it is all rather too 'clean'.To sum... solid playing and direction, but lacking in passion and impact."
1,it stains teeth brown,"I started using Crest Pro-Health night toothpaste in January. By Feb I had developed a pronounced discoloration on my teeth, particularly between teeth. It looked like I chewed tobacco. I tried brushing harder, flossing more and mouthwashes, but it continued to get worse. I went to my regular dentist appt expecting to be told my teeth were rotting away. Much to my relief my dentist was able to remove most of it. It has be be scrapped off. She suppected it was a stannous fluoride rinse, but my rinse was ok, it was the toothpaste. This is a horribe product."
5,An Excellent Insightful Look,"I have listened to this CD over and over and there's nothing quite like it. Mr. Wattles gets to the point without any 'fluff' and since this was written almost 100 years ago, it's still very applicable today. I would recommend this to anyone who (1) doesn't have time to sit and read a book and (2) wants to get the absolute facts on getting rich and how it's possible if these instructions are followed."
4,My daughter's favorite OZ movie!,My daughter loves this movie as it more closely follows the book. She was even surprised that the special effects turned out as well as they did. The Rock King was neat.
4,Story is good but becoming predictable,"This is the third time that JLB has tackled the same type of story: a old murder, an old acquaintance, an old girlfriend and a boyhood friend (who is on the wrong side of the law).The old murder involves the killing of a NAACP civil rights activist forty years ago by a KKK racist. The old acquaintance is an ex-vietnam marine (sound familiar) who became successful (came from the right side of the tracks) and is now running for Governor. The ex-girlfriend is now the politicians wife who has never forgiven Dave for dumping her. The old boyhood friend is a 'made-man' who has been playing both sides for a while and is now in trouble with everyone.Needless to say the bad-guys get their cumuppence and the good guys win, but as always there is some collateral damage to someone near Dave. His old friend and bait shop buddy, Batist, gets stuck between a rock and a hard place, but thankfully survives."
4,Exciting action.,"Dr. Alex Cross is once again facing his old adversary, the Wolf, but this time, Wolf is joined by another evil murderer, the Weasel. Wolf has threatened to wipe out towns and cities all over the world with the use of portable nuclear weapons and starts by evacuating a small desert town in the US and then wiping it off the face of the earth. He follows this demonstration of his power by doing the same in England, but this time he doesn't evacuate the villagers. He is demanding a ransom in the billions to stop this threat and then proceeds to follow through with his plans. Alex is assigned to the case along with the CIA, FBI and English and French police. It's a real actioner which would make a great movie and finishes with the suggestion of a cliff hanger."
4,Loved everything except the ending,"I love Richard Gere and I thought the movie was great. He's still got the ""IT"" factor to me. However, maybe I was up too late but the ending left me thinking ""what the hay"". It just basically ended...and that was that."
4,Super Sick.!,"Not bad, Not bad....But this edition uses the word 'power' instead of 'control'.the translation in general is a bit uneccesarily convoluted and not accurate compared to other versions ive read."
4,Keeps tablecloth protected from toddlers,"This clear tablecloth has worked out perfectly for protecting our cloth tablecloth when our toddler eats at the table. The thickness is just right; it's thin enough to drape over the edges of the table well and thick enough to protect the table from the cats' claws when they jump on it. It wipes clean easily, also sparing me from scrubbing food of the table surface when I used placemats. I only aired it out overnight to ""gas off"". It was fine the next day. The tablecloth does show the fold lines and it's a bit shiny. Those aren't issues for my purposes."
2,Just kicking open doors,This book deserves some merit as a summary of important ideas. Nevertheless it is not worth the investment of money and time because the ideas of the author are as obvious and repetitive as it gets. It is not by saying to think critically or to document your research that you can justify to publish a book and to call it 'turning numbers into knowledge'.
3,Funny and entertaining,"This is a very fun and enjoyable film to watch. I have not seen the original, but people that have seen it say they prefer the remake over it. I must say that this may be more liked by Adam Sandler fans, so if you can't stand him or find him unfunny, odds are you won't find this film a delight.Chris Rock really shines as the Caretaker. He gives a funny and well-acted performance. One thing I wished I'd see more of was more screen time for the professional wrestlers (Kevin Nash, Steve Austin, Bill Goldberg) in the movie. They would've played well for a movie about tough cell mates and guards.Overall, this is a fun football movie. If you like Sandler movies and good raunchy (guy) humor, give this one a shot."
2,Horrible is an understatement.,"I loved the entire series. And even understood the last couple episodes which sent the average viewer scratching his/her own head. Yet this is garbage! No better way to put it. I bought this in hopes that maybe it would give me a different if not better interpretation of the ending of such a great series. In turn i received some ill found ""lets attempt to confuse the viewer"" acid trip sequence of a so called movie!"
4,Good read,This book is unexpected and has a great ending. I would recommend to anyone. Very surprising and refreshing. Very good read.
5,Since By Man,I've seen them live and I think I died of happiness that night. I've never heard anything like them...and I do anything to see them live again. You are consumed and pulled in by their music and you forget all the bad and negative things that have been going on for awhile...buy the cd. It's definitly worth it
1,Very disappointing,"I loved Maile Meloy's story collection, Half in Love, and also enjoyed Liars and Saints. I had really been looking forward to A Family Daughter but I am just so disappointed! The plot is often ridiculous,and the characters just aren't credible enough to carry the book. Much of it is extremely predictable and reminded me of a soap opera. The dialogue just doesn't make sense. A five year old, for example, can speak in complete sentences in real life. This one, a key character, just keeps saying one word, ""Dogs!"" over and over again. I think the difference with this book is that it is completely invented, Half in Love was obviously something she knew from growing up in Montana, and you felt the place and the people resonate through her eyes. This book is just not her best. I am half way through and I can completely understand why other reviewers said they didn't finish it."
5,Like it,"I have never had/used pure Shea Butter before, but like this in a lotion recipe I made. Good price, too."
5,Boppin' Til I Drop!,"I first heard ""Bop 'til You Drop"" on an NPR show in the eighties, and I just had to run out and get the album. It was an album on vinyl! I was thinking about them the other day, no longer have a record player, and decided to look around Amazon. They had this one and Seamless, two wonderful albums.The song ""Bop 'til You Drop"" is here, and is definitely a fun time, dancin' classic. They also do justice a couple of 50's and 60's classics, ""Silhouettes"" and ""Town Without Pity"". Maybe it's the Irish in me, I do sometimes go for the sentimental and romantic stuff. ""Up the Ladder to the Roof (so we can see heaven much better)"" and ""Please (Don't Go)"" are truly things of beauty! If you want to get the definitive of this group, grab this one and Seamless. The only drawback is that back in the 80's, they were still doing only 45 minute albums."
1,You get what you pay for.,"Granted that this filter is as much as a beer at a cheap bar, but ultimately it is not fit to put on any lens. I got a few of them in different sizes for my lenses because I was trying to save money. I put the filters on and they were both flaring like crazy, ruining every shot. I had to take them off to be able to shoot. I would suggest that you spend the 30-50 dollars that a decent Hoya or B+W filter costs and make sure you get multicoated filters."
1,FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!,"... The acting was bad and the characters were totally unrealistic. The story is a sad one but they kinda took it too far on that note. And I mean how many times have we seen this? Let's see bad popular boy falls in love with unpopular do gooder girl. This almost never happens in real life people! No matter how many movies you make about it it just doesn't happen! ... Oh and have you noticed that several parts of the movie are laced with this chick's singing? I mean we all know Mandy Moore is a singer, but that has nothing to do with the film! ..."
1,"no range because ""i have walls""","the wired part works fine. the wireless works fine, too -- in the same room as the router. i have less than a 20' range -- instead of the claimed 300' (indoors -- more outdoors, which i also don't have, because it has to go through -- get this! -- a wall).when i phoned tech support, i was asked if i was in the same room as the router. ""of course not,"" i said, ""if i were, i wouldn't need wireless, i'd just hook it to a cable.""""oh, that's your problem. you have walls. have you tried staying in the same room?""well, yes. but then what's the point of wireless?""why not buy a booster?""i don't want to buy a booster, because i just spent far too much money on this, and i am well near enough the router that i should have decent range.""yes, but the walls block the signal.""a great product, as long as you're right next to the router, or your house has no walls."
2,"not really ""jumbo""","Though it says it is a Jumbo size and it fits an Honda Odyssey. It is a bit smaller than advertised.It think it should be at least 1.5in bigger to fit OK, and about 2in bigger to fix well.It barely stays in place. It works on the Accord though, as the windshield is smaller."
1,Toys for Young Boys,"Bought this gift for my young son, who just turned 5, loves to play cooking games and let's play restaurant taking your orders. And we thought since the product was coming from a brain trust company that it would be great. It was not great...all of the products were very cheaply made in China and some of the pieces were missing and/or the wrong pieces were included in the packaging. I contacted the company/distributor and they backed their guarantee and gave me full credit. They also directed me to a website for all games made in the USA that they sell and distribute. Although found the Let's Play Restaurant well below acceptable standards, I thought the company involved acted honestly and professionally and I wouldn't hesitate to buy from them again..but buy American."
2,Lacks spirit,"Unlike April Morning which captured the raw emotion and driving spirit of the revolution, Bunker Hill is disconnected from such history. Fast lost a great opportunity to expand on the colonist's drive for independence.Instead, he creates a pseudo-romance novel using the revolution as a backdrop, spending a large majority of the book on the sexual exploits of the British Generals, though accurate, it fails to convey the spirit, turmoil, and anguish behind this battle.If you still want to read it, go to Google books where it's free."
5,AWSOME!!!!!!!!!,These laptops just arrived at school and boy are they fast.At home we have a dell xps and its much worse than the apple ibook g4
4,So far so good...,"My husband and I bought this printer about 2 months ago and so far it's been great! The only thing we haven't used on it yet is the fax. So far the photocopy aspect of it is our favorite, it's great just to put the pile of paper in the feed and have it go through no problem.The only down side was when we tried to print photos, they came out with smudges of black ink on them. Other than that every printout, both black and white as well as colour, looks great!It also takes it a little while to warm up when you first turn it on, but for me it's really not a huge deal...you just have to give it time to do it's thing (less than 1 minute) and then you're off!"
4,I have only heard this one song,"When I first heard Okay....well....it is very catchy, I mean Nivea does say Okay a lot. But this song had a good beat, and good people singing it it too! I really enjoy Okay, it makes me happy everytime that I hear it come on!! I love it!! You should definetly get this CD, she has a great voice, and a great CD!!"
4,Its decent tool holder box....,"Well I bought this one and it is decent no doubt they vary with how many pockets the other brands have but this has many pockets and is sturdy. I think this is comparable to home depot husky to be honest they are almost the same I have both if you dont have a HD around you order it otherwise just get the husky brand which I think may even be a bit thicker canvass, to save on shipping if you dont have to buy it online."
4,great,Again Nina Bangs writes a great story. my daughter and I have read most of her books and sure enjoy them.
4,"Moves along, entertaining, quick read","Yes, I liked this book until Seattle fell victim to tsunamis. As all of us on Whidbey Island know, we're at the receiving end of the Juan De Fuca ""funnel of death"" if comet-induced tidal waves occur. Seattle is far from the coast and unlikely to be hit. Small geographical error in an otherwise good sci-fi thriller."
5,super great teaching book...the one I used the MOST!,Hey....just the best book I found on making all sorts of jewelry out of hemp. The knots are easy to learn and the sample pictures give lots of suggestions for variety. I have gotten many compliments on my necklaces...the slide loop clasp is absolutely the greatest way to start a piece. It looks good and is a real pleaser when you give it to someone as a gift. I can't say enough as to how many neat things I learned from this book...I really dig this funky book!
2,Warning: G4 owners read this!,"Hello,I bought this and tried to use it on a Powerbook G4 with 512 ram. The eyetv200 did work, but not well. The video is choppy and grainy. Other problems include that it locks up often, and you have to unplug the unit from the computer and restart it. It wouldn't wake the computer from sleep to record a tv show, like it is supposed to. The other problem is that the tv listing the software uses, is not accurate. It had incorrect times for shows. I reported this and they admited it, and said they contracted the listing with another company. Most importantly there is NO phone contact provided with Elgato. They refuse to provide it. You have to email them with problems, and they email you back.....Days later. They say it will work on anything G3 500 or higher. I strongly disagree! This company needs to provide phone contact and improve their product before anyone should buy it. Great idea, Poor product."
3,Pick this bunch,"3 1/2The second side looses a bit of pulse, but Wildflowers remains one of Petty's most engaging works, the only one I've cared to own actually. Not being a classic rock fan in particular, some of his deepest and diverse studio work sounds evident throughout, likely your classic case of a Rubin sandwich artist revitalization."
4,inside antenna,"I bought this antenna hoping that we could get local channels on our tv. It gets good pictures but you have to move the antenna around for signals on different channels, but I live about 30 miles away from where most of the TV stations are so this might have something to do with it, but overall I'm satisfied with this antenna."
3,Could be better.,"I think I'm being very nice by giving three stars, and thats only because of the sex scenes. The problem with this book is that it's very predictable. Another thing that bothered me was the rushing of Mark and Maya's relationship. I'm all for love at first sight but this was ridiculous! He basically fell in love with her at the very beginning of the book, which is page six, and kissing her on page twenty.This book is 239 pages long, if you are smart you will know who the slayer is way before you reach 100. If you want to read about true romance, a real connection between two people, and a good mystery then don't buy this book."
2,i let my husband read it first,"usually when an anne rice novel comes in to this house a fight breaks out. this fight is so predictable that in the past i have purchased two copies, of her latest work, one for him one for me. something told me this would not be necessary this trip out.. i read 30 pages, left it lying about, he read 50 pages , while on the treadmill and the book has been sitting on the night stand, untouched for a week.. last night he asked me if i could recommend something good to read. anne, thanks for saving me from another marital argument."
2,Chewers beware,Our 7month old Goldendoodle loved this ball...however within an hour I had to take it away as she was chewing the openings to get to the inner ball and could choke on the plastic she was ripping apart.
1,Do NOT do business with Bargaincell!!,"Bought a cell phone battery that, of course, died one week past their return/refund deadline. Refused to refund or replace even though the product is CLEARLY defective. This company is a ripoff and will never do business with them again. Consider yourself warned."
4,Great Movie,"I really liked this movie. I've watched it three times already and enjoy it each time. It's based on a true story of a girl who moved to Cuba with her family prior to the revolution. The story, dancing, and music make this movie a hit. Diego Luna and Romola Garai have great chemistry. I enjoyed this movie and the music so much that I had to buy the soundtrack."
1,Bought 2 and both had problems so i had to return at my expense,"I purchased 2 of these refurb units for my daughters for xmas. One would not read from its internal memory and the other worked for about 24 hours and the next time I tried to connect to it and add more songs, the USB communications would not function and would actually hang my PC. It wasn't my PC because I could disconnect it, then plug the other one in which would communicated fine. I have also had other RCA Thompson products (Lyra Portable Media Players to be more specific) and should have known better because I also had big problems with those devices. As well their tech support is also pretty much non-existent so I highly recommend trying out another brand."
3,It's a tiny book,"I was a wee bit disappointed in this book. It's okay, but small. I was expecting a bigger book with more information."
1,nearly worthless when used with a mandolin,"When I first received the gloves I had great doubt on whether or not these gloves would protect my fingers against the sharp blades of a mandolin. They appear to be nothing more than thin cotton knitted gloves coated with a thick rubberized coating. Sure enough, I slashed through the tip of one finger the very first time I used the gloves with a mandolin. No, I did not cut my finger but only because my gloves were longer than my finger.These gloves are not giving me the peace of mind I was hoping for when I purchased them.To be fair, the gloves are not specifically marketed toward mandolin users. It was positive reviews of mandolin users that led me to purchase them. I would feel confident enough to use these gloves for handling sharp glass or metal edges."
1,Not even a good DVD,"I bought this knowing the plot might be suspect, which it is, but the effects aren't even that good. I bought U-571 at the same time, and it provided a stark contrast. It's effects were outstanding while MI2's were generally unimpressive. All around - the movie sucked. Don't buy it."
3,Wenzel Ponderosa 10' by 8' smaller than I thought,"I bought the Wenzel Ponderosa tent for a Native American powwow in NH. I live in CT. My friend and I put the tent up with no problem, there were mosquitos everywhere. Then I saw there was no way my bed would fit. I bought a queen and my friend was using a cot. Between the bed problem and the mosquitos it was too much, we ending up renting a room for 2 days. I did not check the size of the tent. When I saw 10'by 8' four person two room tent, I figured it would be big enough. I did not get to spray the tent & it rained inside. Make sure you know the dimensions, don't be fooled by 4 person 2 rooms. There is not a lot of room to get around."
5,Rap Pioneers Display Their Impact on Modern Music,"The beastie boys introduced us to a new concept in music. Rap in its early years was struggeling to emerge. The radio was being dominated by white rock and pop stars and was not very open to the radical concept of rap. But when three white guys came up with a theme song which got everyones attention, the walls came down. I remeber my first B-boys concert in Oklahoma City and the spectical of profanity, ludeness and vulgarity that showed me that it was allright to Raise Hell! They opended for Rap Godfathers Run DMC and their strutting and cussing and beer spitting and so on just gave me aspirations of adolescent malicious and otherwise socially unacceptable behavior! The Beastie boys are a milestone for rap and this is a great tribute to what was, is and will continue to be a cornerstone group in Rap History. They have influenced me, my delinquency, my music with my band EARCANDY and given me a lot of very fond memorys. Thanks B-Boys! PEACE!"
4,This Kick-Ass Princess RULES!,"Love a story where a bad, bad girl with attitude gets her act together to take control (of the hero AND the story outcome)? Martha does exactly that with her intriguing hero, Joaquin, and tells her Hollywood detective/adventure story with in-your-face style and the sting of leather lacings in her voice. A fine, fun story!"
3,So-So,I was a fan of the First Scary Movie so I went but it turn out it wasn't as good as it could of been. The movie started strong but went downhill after that. I think it is bad to start with a great start because it make the rest of the movie look bad. I expected great jokes after a opening like that.Only see if you liked the first one.
5,My kind of music,Listening to this music makes me happy! Only downside is that you must change CDs relatively often. Song selection is great!
4,"Love the wireless, doesn't hold battery charge long","I had to have a wireless monitor and this was the one I chose based on reviews and cost. I saw a lot of reviews about charge/battery issues and to an extent, I agree. However, I'm glad that I bought this set because it still works well for me. I love the two parent units and it works well with my house setup. I've found the range to be good and I do not have any back noise issues. The parent units connect quickly and easily to the base unit. My only wish is that they included more than one charging station."
3,"Me llamo Luka, yo vivo en el piso dos...","Many moons ago, I heard this chick trying to sing a Spanish version of her song ""Luka."" It really made me cringe like nothing other has since. Try to imagine Wayne Newton singing in Creole or something. It was really bad.As for the rest of this album, it's not bad in a sort of has-been, washed up sort of a way. Same sort of category of Edie Brickell, Cowboy Junkies, etc. I mean that in a, was-good-at-the-time-only-in-very-limited-quantities-at-that kind of fashion. Vega was by no means a Kirsty Maccoll (R.I.P.) who she seems to have fashioned herself after, even trying to hook up with Billy Bragg as it were. But, I guess she was marginally ok at what she did, for the limited time she did it.Dig it up for the novelty of it all, try to find the Spanish version and laugh/cringe/cry, and then shove it back in the attic."
1,"Awful, terrible, no good, don't buy","First off, it came damaged. There were at least 4 dents. The metal used in construction is very flimsy and easily bends into the wrong positions which makes assembly impossible. Next, the instructions and packaging were created by an idiot. There is 1 page for instructions that is totally incomplete. ""Wrench"" apparently means screwdriver and you have to take it apart before putting it back together. Totally backwards, confusing, and frustrating. DO NOT BUY. I can't return because it was given as a gift without gift receipt."
2,SMALL!!!,I was disappointed in this item due to the size. Think kid size. It was a gift and I was very embarrassed to give it.
5,The BEST,Everything is in the case you need except the 20 gauge. Which we bought one for the kit. Now we have everything to clean our guns with. We can take it with us to clean them where ever we Cowboy shoot.
1,Eckankar: The Key To Secret Worlds,This book is a plagarized work and I am surprised that it is for sale. The original authors should be reinbursed for the use of their information in making this book. I feel that people should be aware of this before buying this book.
5,"""Practical and Easy to Follow""","From Jan Nathan of Publisher's Marketing Association (PMA)-- ""Marisa presents useful, inexpensive, easy-to-follow steps for publishers seeking media attention in D'Vari's energetic, breezy and upbeat style. A fun read, as well as presenting practical info."" --"
5,PHONE CASE- BLACK,"I purchased this item for my husband. He wanted one exactly like the one he purchased 5 years ago. It stood the test on time, very durable and strong material. I am very sure this one will be just as great as the other one. Great lasting item."
1,So little offered,Not worth the time really. I was given the book or would not have otherwise read it. I found many words with very little actually being said.Wealthy Barber at least gets you pointed safely in the right direction without filling your head with dreams of wealth and power untold.
3,Wasn't what I expected....,"Received the Pioneer CDSR 100 Remote and was very impressed at its compact size. The controls are very easy to access and can be operated with ease while driving. Attaching it to the steering wheel took a little time but after studying the figures in the directions--the remote wasn't very hard to put on at all. The only noticable problem(trying to eliminate this problem by repositioning the remote on the steering wheel)is the radio receiving the commands from the remote. I couldn't get the remote to work the radio while attached to the left side of the steering wheel. Is it too far from the radio?? I will try moving the remote to different locations on the steering wheel and see what that does. Otherwise, I like the size and the control functions of the remote."
3,Mixture varies from great to not so good,"I've ordered this product twice. The first time, I loved what I got -- a great mixture of about half caramel popcorn and half chips and cheese puffs, with a few pretzels as well.I'm not so happy with my second order. The bag seems less full, and there is very little of the caramel popcorn in it. This stuff is so light that they can probably make up for the missing weight with an extra couple of corn chips, but it sure doesn't make as good a snack.I don't know if this product has gotten worse, or if the mixture varies from time to time. My first (good) order was in October, 2007, while the second (not so good) was in January, 2008."
4,"Great Monitor, stand could use some work","I purchased this HP monitor a few months ago. I was originally looking at the LG or Samsung. This model had the glossy screen and was cheaper. I always check out the reviews on Amazon, even though I didn't buy it from them. I did get a DVI cable with this, however I am not using it right now and the picture is still way beyond my old CRT or the LCD I have at work. I didn't notice how good it was until I found a website of 1680x1050 wallpapers and have the same picture on my home PC and Work...Now the Down side.... This monitor stand looks great but is not as stable. Small movements of the desk are translated to the screen. It really bothers my wife, I can deal with it. I have even thought of wall mounting it. That being said, I am very happy with the purchase."
3,Nice but little uncomfortable,"I bought black and white each. The material is nice but it hurts me around my rip cage area. I stopped wearing it after 2 days. Plus, my waist looks slimmer without it...LOL"
3,Nothing Much New in Functionality,"As one who upgraded from MS Streets and Trips 2002, I expected to see more functionality. Like 2002 it was also usable on PDA/Cell phone devices. Microsoft drives to you upgrade the product because they stop all support of the earlier versions, which means the database gets out of date. However, if you have never used this product it is the best of its kind. MS Streets and Trips is compatible with several GPS transponders. In my case not a factor in my business yet."
5,Charming!,"Hysteria is truly one of the most adorable, most charming movies I have ever seen! Hugh Dancy is absolutely engaging and precious, and I think this is Maggie Gyllenhaal's most stunning role to date. Her British accent is spot on. All of the actors were magnificent, and the subject matter and story line were totally laugh-out-loud hilarious. I can't wait to watch it again!"
4,Great Bingo set but it doesn't fit the price.,"The package arrived faster than the estimated date. But I was a little disappointed with quality of the cardboard shuttered cards; some are hard to slide open and close, it's not durable, and teared with a little usage. The balls are not round and the letters can be hard to see. All in all, the set will keep your friends and family entertain but the bingo set doesn't fit the price($35 at most)."
5,A great book!!,I am a seventh grade school teacher in an urban school setting in New Jersey. This book help me to encourage my students to reach for the stars in they're goals for life. The characters in this book made it with all of the chaos that surrounded them and turned out to be assets to their community.
2,Forestlover,I have loved all of the books by this author but this one is slow and hard to read. I love Emily Carr's unusual art and history and will finish this book but the experience had been painful.
4,Lars and the Real Girl,"This is a good movie. I feel sympathetic to people who don't fit in very well or have a mental illness. These people still have the same human emotions and needs as everyone and it is sometimes hard for them to cope. I am single and an introvert, so I can understand a little about how this guy feels. The movie has some funny moments because the story is so bizarre, but there are also some sad moments."
2,Bad Elastic,Very nice fabric...weak elastic. One corner of elastic broke the first time we put the sheets on the mattress :(
2,jute?,"This is very sticky and color is stylish, but some crumbles from jute and green plastic (""meshing jute fibers with patented PER plastic"")make my black yoga pants look messy. Not much natural feel from jute, but more plastic feel and smell. Disappointed."
2,Didn't last very long.,Gave as a gift to 1 year old triplets. It broke within 2 weeks. Not very impressed with this product.
1,good night mister hyatt,negative? dark? is it? not really! its a simple book. very simple. especially for mr hyatt whom we know as an insightful and inspired author about magick and related fields. now: this book is all bleak and boring old darwinism. is mister hyatt getting old? frustrated? or did he simply wanted to publish some easy provocations leading to easy money? sad. really. the real psychopath says: non serviam mr hyatt; not this time. christians and other worms may be dutifully shocked out of their little whits by this tired bible. but - heeeee - mr hyatt thats not the audience your writing for. the beast yawns... we hope that mr hyatt catches himself - before he falls into the bottomless pit of pseudo-psychological boredom...
4,nicely animated and good story!,I saw this movie a while ago and I liked it then. I am as a hobby a 3d modeler/animater so I love anything done in 3d/cgi. the story was nice too.
3,Decent little record,"I am a big Wilco fan so was quite interested to hear this recording. The strongest tracks are Hey Chicken and The Ruling Class. The remainder of the album is mixed, quite a bit of filler, largely missable."
2,A waste of time and money,"If you are considering purchasing this thing to make copies of commercially made VHS tapes to DVD, don't waste your time or your money because it is essentially useless for that purpose, the resulting copies are horrible, grainy, and with jittery lines in the picture, etc. Some people say this thing will remove the Macrovision protection which is responsible for the wavy lines and such, but forget it, it will not, at least not to any kind of acceptable degree. As far as I know it is legal to make a backup copy of original tapes that you own, for your own personal use under the ""fair use"" provision, just as you can make an archival copy of computer software, as long as it is for your own use, and not to sell etc. The only reason I gave this thing 2 stars is that it might prove useful for transferring home videos to DVD although I have not tried that yet."
3,Needed more ' real life' stories in The Real Team,"I've read 5 of Marchinkos books over the last 18 months and he writes great stuff. The stories are well described and each reads like an spec. ops. mission that was only recently de-classified.The guys he works with all have unique personalities and backgrounds but plenty of motivation. I bought this book to learn a bit more about who joins the team...and (more importantly) to hear them describe their best/worst missions. Each guy must have a mission that they look back upon?? Beyond just their upbringing, I was hoping to read more of their 'lives on the edge'. I got only a little of that.If you have friend or family looking at the military, this is certainly the book for them."
5,Like Vintage Wine,"Yes 5 years is a long time, but good effort takes time. This is clearly real adult fun. The music is best enjoyed while sipping a white wine and staring into a medow. Many of us live tense lives and Enya helps take the edge off. My only question is this: If you went to an Enya concert wouldn't it spoil the mood to applaud?"
5,To damn funny,"This dude is just so ""F"" ing funny. I might not be able to wait for it to be sold on amazon and just buy it from the askaninja site. I wish this guy would come to comic con or something. One of the funniest things I have seen this year."
5,Fast delivery!,The perfume came very quickly via mail. It was exactly the same kind you'd find at the mail but cheaper. Yay!
1,tasteless water is what you get,"this is the worst coffee i have ever had. all you get is literally warm water. my secretary and i both tried it, then dumped the cups and the pot. it tasted like warm diluted milk, sans coffee."
3,"Great for beginners, not-so-much for the advanced exerciser","I bought this video with high expectations after reading all the glowing reviews. I was really disappointed. The video is well-made and great for the beginning exerciser, but I did not find it challenging at all and hardly broke a sweat except briefly during the bootcamp segment. I usually workout with either Billy Blanks' Get Ripped Advanced Tae Bo series or by taking kickboxing classes at the gym. Compared to these, this video simply doesn't cut it and is much too slow-paced for the advanced level exerciser."
2,Ouch..its so bad,"I have been a Cake fan for quite some time now, and I loved how they were so different and had a sense of style all their own. I was blown away and hooked by the first four cds. However, after buying Pressure Chief, I'm convinced the amazing musical energy I once loved so much is no longer existent.Besides ""Wheels"" and ""Guitar Man"" everything else plays on like an electronic mess. ""No Phone"" might just be the worst song I've ever heard, and supposedly it was the first single! The lyrics don't do McCrea any justice as they did on Fashion Nugget, or Motorcade of Generosity, and all around has been a sad dissapointment. Don't get me wrong, I still love Cake. Nobody is perfect, but I would definitely stick to the older Cds if you are interested in seeing what Cake has to offer, because you won't find it on Pressure Chief."
2,not great mats,"These mats frayed rather quickly, and discolored - I would go with Vinyl - the vinyl mats I have to replace these are so much easier to clean, and they are not discolored."
4,It will really help you with those angles,"Is a great tool to find those odd angles and make the right cuts done right the first time, just practice on scraps before till you get a feeling of the tool."
2,Not impressed. Directions says to make a slurry,"Not impressed with the flavor.There are others with much better flavor.The grind is very very small.It may be okay for soups and stews but too powdery for sprinkling onto anything solid like a rub.In fact the directions says to mix with the broth of what you plan on adding it to first.I will probably use what I have for a brining solution for pork and chicken, along with salt and sugar."
5,Should be required viewing in every US History class.,An absolutely superb series showing the trails and tribulations our founding fathers endured for us to be where we are today. Highly recommended.
4,My 6 year really likes this.,"My daughter does like this TOY. Remember it is toy not a high tech electronic device.The reason I like this toy is that it allows my daughter to play,create, imagine by herself as she creates ""masterpieces"". It did take her a few pictures before she got the hang of how the focus works. It is also insteresting to say how much detail she adds on her own.The reason my daughter says that she likes the projector is that she can make things that she wouldn't be able to by ""just using my hands""."
4,A Very Interesting Parallel,"I received this book as a gift and it is something I treasure today. The author does a very nice job of depicting his growth alongside of the Beatles' music and arrival in America. I like the way Mr. Schaumberg shows how the Beatles became fixtures in his school, e.g., Beatle-themed sketches for school shows, parodies of their songs and the way many kids emulated their hair and clothing styles. It was a fun trip down Memory (Penny) Lane and Mr. Schaumberg is to be commended for bringing the reader into the world that was largely influenced by the Beatles.Yeah, Yeah, Yeah!"
1,SHUTUP!!!!!!!,"i mean one star is too much. garth brooks reiks. why wasnt he a victim of the texas chainsaw massacre, lol?!?!? try out some Zombie, some real good music"
4,Very timely--wonderful collection!,"I think that they made a very good compilation of Silk. It's unfortunate that they left Elektra Records and decided to go on an independent label. This group knew how to sing it on the most sexy of songs. Freak Me went to No. 1, but I thought that the group had better songs than that, which are on this album. I especially like the bass-heavy Happy Days, Don't Rush, the hits from ""Tonight""--Meeting In My Bedroom, Let's Make Love, If U, and We're Calling You. I especially like I Can Go Deep which was on the Low Down Dirty Shame soundtrack from '94 but they put it on their '95 album. The song's originally over 6 minutes (was on the single), but they cut it to 4:47 for both albums.That song is so smooth with its calm basslines and romantic, lush landscape. I think that Silk had some memorable hits and got better at their craft as a vocal group. Very timely for them to release this album!"
1,Fun if you're just looking to be a better lay,"While some of these techniques and tips are useful or at least a little entertaining, this book doesn't have much to offer to women looking for a better understanding of straight men's experience of sex. Most unfortunately, it reinforces all kinds of stupid stereotypes of straight men as sex maniacs (they're apparently ""always in the mood"") and shameful attitudes about women's bodies (don't tell him about your period! god forbid you'd ask him to be mature enough to deal with the realities of your body and its needs! ew!). If you're looking for real advice on how to be a better, more understanding partner to a straight man, look elsewhere. Or at least take this with a MAJOR grain of salt."
2,Worked a couple of months,It was discouraging that this stopped working as we could not tell until the ice formed and the DeIcer was sitting on top. In view of the good reviews I am going to try another one and hope that the good reviews will prevail.
1,Listen to the samples before you buy,"The back of the CD has the original artist's name after each song, but these are definitely not the original recordings, and I don't like any as well as the originals."
1,Casta is no gipsy at all....,"I have listened to many guitarist, but casta I expected more from u, but u let me down. This album was your first and last album in my opinion. Tedious rhytm and boring voices. Guitar palying is way off , and doesnot accompany the singers. If you really want a nice spanish guitar cds, check my reviews. Casta's cd will give u a big disappointment if u buy. Casta tries to join guitar with spanish mood and latin percussion, but he fails. I have nothing against casta, he may be a good person as his label comapny alula records says, but his music is very weak, and gipsies won't like this album at all. Plz, donot call your self gipsy. The album has some tracks that you will hate it, lake of talent and passion. Casta feels like gipsy, but real gipsy's music comes from heart and passions. Casta has to improve his style and music. Work hard Casta, you can do it."
3,Misleading Name,"Well, when you are researching a bunch of bicycle accessories and you see ""QR"" in the title, you can pretty much assume that stands for Quick Release. Except for this one. It does NOT have a Quick Release clamp, it has a 4 bolt allen wrench clamp. you can see this if you look closely at the photo, but I guess I missed it after comparing so many racks, some of which have Quick Release clamps.I'm sending mine back, because I really wanted that feature so I can move it to different bikes easily. This rack looks OK and well built, but it stands out as being rated for only 15 lbs as compared to 20 for most of this type, and it seems a bit short (I ordered the V model)."
3,"good for beginners, but you'll outgrow it","this dictionary is wonderful for the beginner, but will soon be outgrown by the serious student of Chinese. Though the characters are small, a little experience with characters will make it easy. This book is best used as a second reference used sparingly once you have got intermediate communication skills."
1,JUST GOT RIPPED OFF! BEWARE!,"Read the back cover of the box very carefully. What at first seems like a very attractive 3 disc collection of songs by original artists will soon disappoint. Look for the words ""Made famous by"" in the artists column. I missed them and ended up spending $18.00 for mediocre remakesof some classic songs. Though this pick-up band trys to please, they are hampered by poor sound balance and far too many artistic styles to mimic. Be aware that this set is not part of the authorized Pure Mood series that featured all original artists, through the years. How the hell did they get away with it?"
1,Shipping problems ?,"I would not recommend ordering this item unless you can wait a long time for it to be shipped. Ordered it almost two weeks ago, and every time I check on it, the shipping time frame gets moved out. If the book is back ordered and there is a problem, it would be nice if amazon was up front about it. I need this text for class and since I was counting on it from amazon, the bookstore is now sold out. If I had known there was a problem I would have paid more at the bookstore and at least been left in a lurch. I have always had good luck with amazon in the past but I must say I am exceptionally disappointed."
4,Fullscreen is appalling!,"I agree that the full screen version otherwise distracts the viewer from what should be a great viewing experience. If there was any value in John Huston directing this movie, it is in the scope of the sets and the dance scences. In this version, it sometimes looks like some amateur put down their camcorder accidentally leaving it on--like when Molly sings ""You're NEver Fully Dressed"" there is a shot of the ceiling and you only see Molly out of the lower corner of the screen! Bizarre, and I hope they come out with a widescreen version."
3,i liked the camera.,i like the camera the only thing i was a bit disappointed in is the amount of pictures it could hold 17 in all. i expected at least 25 could have been stored. i guess i;ll have to by more memory.
1,What happened to this company?,"I purchased a new contractor's briefcase in January 2012 to replace the one I purchased back in 1999, which had finally started to show wear in the stitching. I was extremely happy with my previous briefcase; it lasted longer than I expected. Already, my new one has seams splitting in THREE places! I had to replace the strap with the one from my previous briefcase because it immediately started fraying. I doubt I will use my new one for more than a few months -- it just seems cheap and unreliable.With a ""quality"" product such as this I expected there would be some sort of replacement guarantee. In fact, Bucket Boss has almost no internet presence, and only a toll-free number. Calling the number allows you to leave a message, which is never answered (it has been a month since I called).Considering Bucket Boss' former quality, I'm very disappointed."
4,Electric light Orchestra (ELO) - Zoom Tour Live,"Although this concert is in a small concert setting, The quality of sound and video is very good. They play one hit after another, and you will know all the songs,which makes it fun. His voice sounds just as good as it always has and the instumentals are perfect.His voice is still so unique and they are played and sung very professionally. We enjoyed this dvd. In fact, we watched it two nights in a row."
2,good concept but dosent really work,"I think this is a great concept and I like the golf design but they are worthless. They are tiny and they fall right off the second they move. My little guy is a wiggle worm, as most babies are, and these never stayed on."
3,You knew what was going to happen.,"I gave this book three stars because I basically knew what was going to happed after the first few chapters. The main character, Jason, was a quiet boy who kept to himself and who didn't like the spotlight on him at all. Even in class when the teacher called on him. He liked little kids a lot, he liked how they acted. Jason was acused of murdering a young girl who he liked to play with every once in a while. Since he was the last person to be seen with her, they pointed the finger at him.I could have given this book a lower rating but the book was exciting in a way that made me never put it down until the book was done. So thats why I gave this book three stars."
1,Not Impressed,"I am either too literal, too linear, too unimaginative, too normal, or some combination therein, to find anything remotely advantageous about reading this book, other than being prepared for class (it's required reading). I was not shocked, disgusted, horrified, entertained, touched, enthused, enraged, or enraptured. Maybe a little frustrated.I will definitely be keeping this one in the bathroom. Not for reading, but in case I run out of T.P.Guess I'm just not progressive enough to ""get it.""Here's the one I couldn't put down:Shock & Awe (Macmillan New Wrting)"
3,Paddle,"Inexpensive...weapon retention is moderate to good but not the best...the build is on the ""soft""side so you have to adjust it's position over a whole day of carrying but all in all for the price it's a decent rig....I wouldn't necessarily recommend for concealed DUTY..but for the everyday person should be all good..a better option for more money would be one of the rigid molded rigs...but the soft comfort of this holster is a bonus..."
5,This one actually works!,This router is the best works with anything and NetGear has a 5 year warrenty too! NetGear is what my whole network is based around and wouldnt use anyone else after useing linksys which was the absoutly worst hardware in the world.. NetGear makes great products!
3,what happened to Shirley's grunts and moans?,"I watched this recently on the Westerns channel, and at 3 points in the film--twice when he's hoisting her up and once at the end when the tub water splashes over his hat--Shirley MacLaine gives out with these very un-nun-like exclamatory vocalizations. Right after this viewing--to replay one of the more violent scenes--I played the DVD and...NOT ONE OF THE 3 IS ON THE SOUNDTRACK! What happened, Universal?"
5,CUlinary Math has lots to offer,"For those in the food trade or those who are learning the food trade, Culinary Math has a lot to offer. It is a refresher on on conversions, costing, metric, and much more. This book focuses on they types of math needed to build a standard recipe, convert a recipe, work out total costs and more. As much a workbook as a math text, the exercises are useful in setting these mathematical principles into your mind and is a good preparatory for on line certification in cost control. For those people who have been out of school for awhile and those who are weak in math, this book will be a tremendous help."
2,Measure your chair before ordering?,"I have a 16"" sports wheelchair. I assumed this would work. Wrong. The seat is slung between the back tires, which cantilever a bit, to give better stability on the basketball court. Place a 4""x16""x18"" cushion on my wheelchair seat and you sit too high. The cushion impedes the movement of those tires. tried it on my office chair as well. It's too high and hard to keep in the seat. Regreattably, I will return this item. It might be great for a heavier person with a standard size wheelchair. It just doesn't work for me."
4,late comer to the party,"Out of pure desperation for new authors, I picked up this book and Along Came A Spider through a used book store. I hadn't seen the movies and I like to read series, especially if I like it.After completing the second book, I do tend to like the character of Alex Cross, but since there are innumerable reviews already posted, I'll only write what I didn't like about it.1) Patterson switches from first to third person constantly which confused me until I got used to it2) The main female protagonists are always seeming to sleep with Alex Cross.That's it.For the most part I enjoyed it. It was a quick read, although a bit formulaic. I'll probably pick up the next in the series but if things seem to stay in the mold, I may stop after that."
4,okay,if you already like these guys you will like this. little kids will like them. a little more hammie than i had remembered. 3 stooger stuff.
3,Stroboframe Accessory Shoe,"The description failed to describe the product clearly, particularly about the screw at the bottom, if it is a female or male. I received the unit on time but could not use it so I returned the unit."
4,GREAT SHOW - HOWEVER...,"No one does a biography like A&E, and this 100 minute program is the best on Ms. Minnelli so far. However, please know that the above description is incorrect as there is NO interview footage with Beyonce Knowles, Martin Scorsese, Robert DeNiro OR Goldie Hawn. However, there is some new footage in this updated version of the 2004 biography, including comments from Mary J. Blige and Alan Cummings, news footage of Liza's wedding to David Gest and one very short (maybe 5 seconds) clip of Liza commenting on Gest. While it doesn't include as much as promised in the description, Liza purists may want to replace their 2004 version with this newer, updated one."
3,o.k. but not great,"Petals on the River was not a bad book but it was certainly not the best written by Kathleen E. Woodiwiss. The two main characters tend to gush over each other WAY too much and that gets really boring really fast but it had a semi-decent story to it. I would recommend reading the Flame and the Flower, A Rose in Winter and the Wolf and the Dove first. The stories are better and the characters aren't as annoying. Read this one after those only if you have nothing better to do."
4,Smallville Review,"I loved this show growing up i think i was in the 6th grade when it first started, not long after that 9/11 happened. I loved re-watching this series and might watch it again next year, The DVDs were packaged better then i expected and only a few were scratched,(only reason for 4 stars instead of 5) but all played with no problems i was half expecting to have the nightmare of the Stargate SG-1 complete box set where almost all the disc came so scratched that they didn't play. This purchase was well worth the money for me and will be for anyone who loved the show growing up."
2,Is this really the best?,"The best of Ripley's Believe It Or Not or so the label says.Well,all I can say is if a tattooed man,followed by another tattooed man,followed by people that like to jump fences etc is the best,then I'm glad that I didn't watch most of this show's episodes. There is one shocking scene of a man that lost most of his face,but nothing remarkable otherwise.I remember the original show which was much better than this newer on. That original version had far more substance where as this show is more of the sideshow tent variety. Not worth the money."
2,Too thin,When I saw this advertised it gave me the impression of being a little thicker than it actually is. If you only want something to prevent fingerprints and scratches it's okay.
2,joy o joy,I THOUGHT THIS ITEM WAS DIFFERENT THAN THE ONE I HAVE.I REALLY DID NOT ENJOY IT'S CONTENTS. MAYBE NEXT TIME.
5,Love Celine,I recently purchased the CD Falling Into You by Celine Dion and just love it I love all of her music and this CD was no exception.
3,Ski trip to Italy...,"Some interesting insights but a whole lot of bad hyperbole and attempts to be cute. How come no one mentioned the escape from Val d'Isere, France by skis, at night, 10 miles in ""my mid forties."" That was the tiebreaker. Ouch."
4,Extreme!!,"This game is fantastic! Graphics are amazing and gameplay is great! There is actually a developed storyline in this game unlike the previous unreal tournament games.My only complaints about this game is that when you're fighting along side with an AI character and they say something over the radio, they don't open their mouths and speak.But overall, amazing game! Plays great on PC, even better if your PC has a PhysX card! You get realistic ragdolls, loinclothes over armor moves realisticly as character moves, same with realistic movement of the flags in capture the flag (flag waves back and forth as the player runs carrying the flag with him/her)Also, Ageia released special physics mods for UT3 players with PhysX cards. Mods include special levels with destructable environments (need a door? Shoot the wall and walk through!) and friggin tornadoes!!!Overall, great game! Amazingly fun, especially on multiplayer with your friends!"
5,Brillant DVD for a timeless masterpiece...OOP?!,"Oh, no! Why OOP again? This is a must for one who loves comedies and one who loves great DVDs. CRITERION has done their best on this and now...leave it to memories."
5,Excellent Resource for Young Moms,"Tricia Goyer knows what it's like to be a teen mom. Adding personal experience to meticulous research, she has created this invaluable resource for young moms and those who are close to them. This book resonates with truth, honesty, and encouragement. I highly recommend it!"
4,Worth it for one song alone.,....and that song is Comfortably Numb with Bob Geldof singing. Stunning. It is good to see Gilmour off the gravy train and doing music under his own name. It's a lot more honest than the stuff he was doing in the 80s and early 90s.
5,Great Product,"My Husband put them on his truck, they look awesome.They are very bright when you turn them on. They are a great product. Thank you"
4,About bad taste isn't the same as in bad taste,"I bought this album when it was only available as a British import only because no American company had the balls to release it. Not as startling today, but remember that this was released in the days of Journey, Styx and Toto. Makes its point with gigantic exclamation marks. No subtlety here."
5,The very best book to learn to knit your first sweater (and beyond)!,"After years of frustration and confusion, I finally turned the corner with this book -- and I have the knitted sweater(s) to prove it. So many 'learn-to-knit' authors are unable to take on the mindset of a complete beginner, but these women have somehow accomplished the task. They literally take you row by row from beginning to end of a project. This is especially important when it comes to shaping a garment. Although there were some errors in the early editions, corrections were on the website. Projects are both hip and classic, nothing fussy or over-the-top. For someone who loves to work with multicolored yarns, the patterns are perfect and will be used for years to come. Way to go, Yarn Girls!!"
3,More of the same,"I've debated with myself about writing this review for a while. I'm a big fan of Eddi - I own all her solo albums and I've seen her in concert 3 times. I even wrote a laudatory review for Angels & Electricity.But I find this album to be disappointing. There is nothing new and I don't feel she is progressing much as an artist. I thought the writing combination of her and Boo Hewerdine was extremely gifted. Now I think maybe she needs to broaden her horizons and seek out new writing partners and material. Otherwise this will be my last Eddi Reader cd.If you are new to Eddi I would suggest one of her stronger cd's - any of the first three will do. My personal favourite is the second one - Eddi Reader.Her voice is magical, her sensitivity and emotion remains. But the songs just aren't very memorable.What do you think?"
1,What happened?,I can't beleive you people like Gremlins 2 it's dumb. This time they are in New York City and they all hatch during the day but not night. It's good to see everyone back but what happened to Billy's parents? The only thing good about this movie is the big spider near the ending. The first Gremlins is the best stick with that one. This sequel is just lame.
4,Cute diaper bag!,Lots of comments on this cute but useful diaper bag. Could maybe use a zipper close rather than just the buckle. Things can fall out if you lean over.
4,A classic remake of a good game,Final Fantasy 2 for the PSP is a Great buy and at the price you can't go wrong. classic RPG gamers and new ones alike will appreciate this game very much. This game is very challenging and you will have to strategize deeply to overcome a lot of the obstacles.
5,Excellent!!! Support this rising star!!,"I have to admit that I am a friend of the author, but being as objective as possible this book was a page-turner!! I lost a lot of sleep for about 4 nights enjoying this book. This is Louis Kelley's freshman novel and is a fantastic foundation for many more to come. Try it and you won't regret it!"
2,Another Source for Letter Forms,"If you're trying to learn Copperplate calligraphy, I don't recommend this as your first book. Instead, Eleanor Winters' Mastering Copperplate Calligraphy is a much better tool for self-study. However, once you master the material in Winters' book, you might find the Technique of Copperplate Calligraphy to be a good source for additional examples of letter forms, especially capitals."
1,EA should brace for lawsuits,"No company or individual has the right to install a rootkit on your computer without your permission and communicate with their servers without your knowledge. It'd be alright if they came out and told people what they were doing, but they didn't. You install the game and you've installed a corporate virus. It's just wrong, and if the Sony situation is any indication, EA can look forward to some bad publicity and legal trouble."
2,christmas tree diaster,"I really really was pressing my luck on time frame to receive a christmas tree through an online order.When i received the item in time for christmas i was ecstatic! until i opened the box and the stand for the tree to erect with balance on was somehow gone. the shipper managed to leave out those pieces and i had to rush and get a tree that wasnt exactly what i wanted, to make matters worse- the stand didnt come with that one either. all i request is to send what is advertised IN WHOLEhappy holidays"
2,Too heavy!!,"This dryer is average. It doesn't dry much better than other dryers. It weighs a TON. If you have long hair like I do, your arm will be ready to fall off after 10 minutes. If I try to dry my hair AND my daughter's in the same night it is nearly impossible. Do yourself a favor, and buy a lighter dryer!"
3,A good idea...but...,"I agree this book is a great concept and I really enjoy all the cast and characters involved except for one. The Heroine or rather Libby. I understand she is bitter over her failed relationship and is now raising her sweet son on her own. But I found the extent to which she holds on to her bitterness really hard to take. I truly don't know how the hero, Declan holds his attraction to her when she is constantly undermining and berating him. At 3/4th through this book I had yet to see Libby's attitude evolve and show any level of growth towards understanding. I find her character extremely frustrating and that is why I can only give this book 3 stars... The romance is just too one sided...and Libby is too unforgiving."
3,Order rectified ! Situation all good.,"I previously wrote a negative review. My appologies to Omar. At least Omar did contact me and was very anxious to clear up the mail delays. I give him credit for that . For my long delay and miscommunication my money was voluntarily refunded with out me asking. He does seem to care about his service. Flag arrived, our Olympics are saved . GO CANADAChris L."
5,Used on my Honeymoon,"I loved using this camera! It's so easy to figure out and all the explanations are right on the flip out screen so there's no guessing which setting you are on. I used it to shoot fast moving waterfalls, and acrobats. It worked well at night and even caught fireworks and pyrotechnics perfectly. The 14 different shooting modes allow for any type of picture taking. All my wedding pictures look like they were done professionally and that makes my husband and I very happy with this camera (the first item we bought together)."
5,Crop in style xxl,The price I got this item for was excellent. It is very nice a roomy and all of my scrapbook supplies fit and has room to spare. If you are looking to get organized this is a great investment.I really do like the crop in style products.
3,Average,"The movie is worth the rental if the price is discounted. The movie cast is strong, but the storyline is meh."
3,Ray Barretto's second album with Ray De La Paz on lead vocals.,"While not disastrous enough as to merit a 1-star rating, this 1982 release from Ray Barretto does not live up to the standard set by albums such as ""Together"", ""Barretto Power"", ""The Message"" or ""Rican/Struction"". The New York Salsa scene of the first half of the 1980s was truly in a state of flux thanks to the arrival en masse of Cumbia and Merengue bands which took the city's dance music scene by storm and pushed Salsa to the sidelines and many Salsa musicians (including the genre's living legends) probably saw no other option but to make their music more commercial in order to compete. This album's high points are the hits ""Amor Artificial"", ""Indiferencia"" and ""Manos Duras"" but the other five songs are of average quality at best. If you are a true Ray Barretto fan you'll probably enjoy this CD but know that it's by no means his best work of the 1980s."
4,Perfect Fryer for Small Batches,This fryer works great. It heats up fast and holds temperature between batches. Very little splattering with lid. I'd recommend it for two people sized jobs.
3,Maverick a fast firing non-semi auto or full auto gun,I've seen a lot of reviews saying it is a semi auto gun whitch is totally wrong. A semi auto gun can fire as fast as you can pull the trigger. An assault rifle is full auto whitch this is not. This gun is good if you want to fire at close ranges and don't have to worry about accuracy. Get the Nightfinder instead it has a laser sight to help you aim it can go farther and is more accurate. The maverick is good for a last ditch effort and your being swarmed.
3,"Very Nice, But May Not Please Old Fans","Caravan, led by original member Pye Hastings and apparently still going strong, released this album of all new material back in 1995. It certainly is not another ""Land of Grey and Pink"", but then, it's not 1971 anymore, either. What it we have here is a beautifully performed and produced collection of mostly mid tempo pop/rock songs. Pye Hastings always excelled at writing this kind of material, and has retained his writing, playing, and singing skills over the years. There is very little jamming, but brother Jimmy Hastings provides several nice flute and sax solos. The graceful arrangements feature organ, piano, violin, acoustic and electric guitars. Frankly, this isn't a ""progressive"" rock album, but a pleasant listen it is none the less."
3,A Good Movie That Got Annoying.,"I love the story of Peter Pan and was excited to see this thing in theaters. I was disappointed, but not overly so. I loved the actor that played Peter Pan, but I found his yelling when he was flying or fighting a bit much and annoying. I loved the young beautiful girl who played Wendy, but her teeth were...interesting to say the least. It was so obvious they were fake. What was wrong with her natural ones?All in all, the movie *is* fun to watch. I'm sure the young kids may like it. :)"
1,NO Optical Digital output!,"I have no opinion on the performance of this unit since I required the optical digital output to complete the installation of this unit to my receiver. (My receiver has one coaxial digital-audio input which is already occupied by the cable TV's signal but two unused optical digital-audio inputs). The specs for this unit promises an optical digital-audio output, but this DVD player has none."
2,"Look at the Turtle Go, Bro!","I thought the Peppers would recover from Californication but it just got worst. Sorry, this cd SUX! I didn't know Lawrence Welk was still alive until I heard this trash. I guess the socks are soo long ago.Fishbone RULES!BROOKLYN S T A N D U P!"
2,Ok product,"pretty much the only thing that worked well was the knife. its compact and fits my wallet well, but all the other tools don't work so well like the bottle opener."
5,Awesome product,I just received my Pro. salad shooter today and let me tell you it is awesome. Very quick and very easy clean up. I am impressed!!! A must have for any kitchen.
2,Lame,"This is a terrible remake. It lacks all of the charm of the original, leaving the viewer with a revamped (no pun intended) story line that is ridiculous. The dialogue is horrendous. There is nothing about this movie that recommends itself."
5,Spirit Rider,"Another successful purchase from Amazon, item arrived safely and promptly, I'm very happy with my purchase."
5,Klipsch ProMedia 2.1,"These are fantastic speakers. I think you can really judge a speaker at low volume. These are very crisp, clean, at low or high volume. I have not had them past 1/2 way, and that is righteous for Me. I also want to mention the Customer Support, it was also fantastic. On the phone friendly knowledgable, good people. Emails answered within 48 hours. Fed ex lost the wall brackets and they were replaced the day after FedEx admitted they were lost. I highly recommend this company. And know you will love these speakers for music and gaming. Enjoy"
1,don't be fooled,"This is a great item unfortunately the item description states a pair and in reality you only get one. So while you get suckered in to buying and waiting for the second dumbbell, have fun getting a good work out in with one dumbbell."
3,Rebate Beware!,"If you are considering the purchase of this D-Link hub because of the $20.00 rebate be advised to only use the online rebate form, if it is available. A direct rebate from D-Link is highly problematic, no matter how meticulously you prepare your submission or how dogged you are in pursuing the issue."
3,"Good read, but for the characters","This was a better read than the 3 stars I gave it. The characters were very well developed and Wood did an excellent job of developing the different worlds within the book (the domed cities, destroyed cities, the desert)--you were there. Many of the passages within destroyed Philadelphia, the tunnel families, and the confrontation with the rangers were vividly painted and made for rapid page turning. What I couldn't quite get over was the real lack of redeeming qualities in the main characters. Berk was more of a self-centered, self destructive individualist rather than an idealistic pioneer. And Sadonya...you just had to try and understand how a violent and vicious environment and upbringing can create a person absent of any compassion or regard for humanity. If your stories don't need heroes, you may enjoy the book immensely. If you like to root for the protagonists, you may come away a little lacking."
2,saw it in the theatre,"I disliked this in 1992, when I didn't know anything about movies, and now that I work in the movie industry, and see it again, I see why I didn't like it; it stinks. Every great director has an embarrassment, this is Coppola's. Bad casting ( Keanu Reeves must be the most mis-cast actor in history ), bad screenplay. 20 minutes into the movie they start throwing gags at you, like rats running upside-down on the ceiling, and shadows that move independently - every 5 minutes, non-stop; no subtlety, no mystery. Production value is good, which keeps it above 1 star, but still very weird, and weird in a way that does not work, lots of clashing, gawdy designs."
3,"Sick? Nah, just misunderstood.................","""La Folie"" is just a tale about some Japanese student that practiced cannibalism. That's it. The ACT and the GUY was sick, but the album isn't just about cannibalism. It's witty, melodic and quite poetic. The classic ""Golden Brown"" is what sets the tone on this album. ""Let Me Introduce You to the Family"", is a romping, rhythmic sarcastic view of the dynamics of a family. My favorite song on this album. The new addition, ""Cruel Garden"", is a wonderful tribute to the music of Django Reinhardt, the great jazz guitarist. The keyboards, bass, Hugh Cornwall's (edited because facts are friends!) haunting and beautiful voice are the real stars. Buy this CD and ignore all the hype."
4,For the true Haggard Fan,"This box set is a must have for the true Haggard and country music fan. Nashville has long turned it's collective back on Haggard - and he seems to have reciprocated. Unfortunately this has left a void in young people's appreciation of what has come before the Toby Keiths and Trace Adkins' of the world. This set gives not only a great insight into who Merle Haggard is, but also into the evolution of some of the many classics he's written and recorded. We get several inside glimpses into the recording process of the classics through the outtakes that are included here. Untamed Hawk shows you why Haggard will always be a legend in country music and why he's one of the ""First Name"" club members of country music along with Hank, Johnny and Lefty. The only drawback is that this is a Bear Family collection and as such the artist receives precious little, if any, of the money you pay out for it."
4,Good CD/radio but display not bright,"Purchased this unit on sale at Fry's for about $79 including installation for my wife's 2002 Civic. This relaced a four-year-old JVC player,that replaced a six-year-old factory player. Both had progessive problems that made them hard to use (they did not just stop working). We have had this unit for several months and my wife - who only uses the radio and (mostly) the CD player - considers it to be a good easy-to-operate radio/CD player. The only problem is the display which, at it's highest setting, is not bright enough to be seen during the daylight hours with sunshine. Otherwise it is a good player for the price."
4,"Vivaldi: Cello Concerti, Vol. 4",The performance was excellent. The only reasion I did not give it a 5 was that the use of spicatto was not in the Baroque style. I still enjoy it very much.
5,Best Album of the 80's,"There's no question that this is THE BEST ALBUM of the 80's. It's been 13 years from the first time I heard this record (in audio cassette by that time), and I still enjoy the songs today like in 1987. With Or Without You is also THE BEST SINGLE OF THE 80's.You must own this CD (I recommend the gold version from MFSL, also available at Amazon)."
4,"A Great, Quirky but Fun Flick!!!","Big Trouble in Little China is what a Popcorn movie should be. Lot's of action but at the same time lot's of laugh's as well. John Carpenter has thrown in some key, funny moments that really keep the film going smoothly. And Kurt Russel is at his best as the non-typical hero who keeps dropping his weapons and getting his butt kicked, but his fast ""reflexes"" are what keeps him alive it seems. Some good creepy scenes from fright-master Carptenter, but not too much gore to keep the younger viewers from watching! The sound and video transfer are both great, didn't see anything distracting at all! Great Flick!"
2,Item missing,"I received this product on time which was great. When I opened the box, however, the packaging was open and there was an item missing from it. All I have are the tweezer which work great and the case. The insertion/removal tool was not in the package."
4,Worth renting,As an adult seeing this for the first time with my kids i found it hillarious. The kids thought it was slow until the family got to the island and the children got to show off thier powers. As it was they asked to watch it again the next night.
2,Nowhere near on par with the rest of the series.,"While I enjoyed the other books of the series, I found this title to be lacking.Almost every aspect of the story seemed rushed, or not worthy of being written.Origins that dont go deep enough to truly explain the charactors, storys that mearly show an event in the charactors lives, or storys that are pretty much exatcly as you would expect them to be without need for explanation (arseface).I regret purchasing the title"
2,Bibleman Review,"Bibleman Video ReviewI received this DVD as part of the BookSneeze program through Thomas Nelson Publishers. I was given this DVD to review in exchange for my honest opinion.Bibleman Video: Combating The Commandant of ConfusionI like Bibleman, but this DVD was not up to the good quality of other Bibleman DVDs. This one was live. Maybe that is the reason for the lower quality.I let my two girls watching the DVD. They said it was ""pretty good, but not great."" Don't let this keep you from the Bibleman series."
4,horse,I was very disappointed not to be able to watch this movie as it did not work in any of our dvd players stating (NOT REGIONS CODE).I have seen this movie a few years ago and loved it ordered from your company but alas it did not work and had to be returned. I love this movie and wish I could get a copy that would work here in Australia.
4,Great,A great story well told. Makes you really understand the west and realize how good we have it. Great story.
3,Good for those who want to make a career switch.,"This book addresses its audience well, but everyone else may be disappointed. A thorough list of jobs that writers can apply for is listed, along with informative definitions and income estimates. The book will not help you apply for any of the listed jobs, however, and one has to wonder about the accuracy of Guiley's information. Surely a journalist in Houston will make more money than one in a rural town. If you love to write and do not know what opportunities are out there for writers, however, then this book is a great place to start."
3,Not one of the best painters tapes you can buy,"This tape doesn't stick well to all surfaces and allows paint to ""bleed"" under. I was under-impressed. For good, quality effect I would recommend a better quality tape. This product caused me to perform a lot of redo and touchup work."
4,Best of the Originals,The last voyage of the original cast and crew was one that will not be forgotten. The DVD enhances the experience even more. There is also a teaser trailer on this DVD that is most interesting. Don't pass this opportunity up.
3,Unfinished Prayer,"There are signs of the former brilliance found in the writing of this unfinished novel which was published posthumously in 1987. Sadly, is not the great work that Capote had promised. As far as it goes it is an intriguing glimps into the life and thoughts of the author as it seems to be largely autobiographical."
5,Very good introduction to Implicit Surfaces,"Don't expect this book to be anything like a bible on implicit surfaces. But if you are looking for a way to get quickly accustomed to the existing work, it's definitely the right book. You will find lots of pointers, in a wide range of related subjects."
4,Great view,"I transport troubled children so I need a good view of all in the vehicle. This gives a great view, The suction cup did not work well and the stem busted. We attached it to the rear mirror and it worked great."
1,"Don't buy the audio-cassette version, either!","From skimming the many reader comments, I see I am not alone in thinking that this P. Cornwell does not meet her usual standards. Bad, choppy writing, poor character development, wandering plot, all EXACERBATED by the dreadful narration of Chris Sarandon. His shrill and strident speech is grating, the bad southern accents are horrible, while the background music is discordant and poorly timed. I was really glad to be done with this recorded book. For an idea of how it should be done, rent or buy any George Guidall narration for RECORDED BOOKS, INC"
3,Just ok,"I definitely loved his Power Yoga, this dvd was just ok. I expected maybe longer reps/holds. But I'm still a fan of Rodney Yee so will still try other of his dvds."
1,Don't waste your money,I bought this bag to take my bike to europe. My mechanic almost laughed at me. There is no fork mount and it's a canvas type material so...unless your bike is a $100 wallmart special that you do not care about getting messed up...DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE! For another $140 you can get a hard case with a fork mount somewhere else.
1,"Outdated (2000), tiny (79 pages) booklet","Complete disappointment is all I got from this tiny booklet. In the fast changing and very competitive cruise industry to rely on amazingly outdated booklet (2000), which barely scratch on the surface of so huge topics such as ""How to get a cruise ship job?"" and ""What is to work onboard a cruise ship?"" will only lead to application failures and disappointments.That's why if you want complete, step-by-step, professional-grade instructions on impact cover letter and resume writing as well as acing an interview you can find them only in ""Cruise Ship Job in 14 Days"". Otherwise if you are looking for a book which focuses on the life onboard and contains many stories of people who have worked on a cruise ship the best two are ""Working on Cruise Ship"" and ""How to get a job with a Cruise line and travel around the world""."
2,It's okay but hard to watch for one reason...,"I was actually at this pay per view live, so I picked up this DVD. Allthough it really isn't a bad wresting show at all, you can't forget that on the night of this pay per view Chris Benoit was absent from the show. He was busy killing himself after brutally murdering his wife and child in their Georgia home. With this constantly in the back of your mind, it is very hard to watch this show."
2,Not portable,"Beware. Only works if you carry DVDs and DVD player (or have computer with DVD). Cannot copy to computer or play on portable device. Very tough for road warriors. It is truly best for ""in home"". I tried emailing beach body with this question and never got a response so I decided to purchase and try it. No luck and finally got help from live chat (nice feature). Wish that they made this easier to bring with me. iPad version would be even better.How good is it? Not sure. Have been on the road since I got it and I am sure that it will be tough to stay on program because is not portable enough. Rating it low for this reason"
2,Was this the best they could do?,"A poor production, both sight and sound. Rumpole, and the people who love the series, deserve better."
5,My daughter is very happy to have it,"My daughter loves it. It is very bright and pretty. It took me 20 minutes to put together, very easy. The shipment is fast."
3,Didn't speak to my soul,"Well, some of it did. But the sarcasm was at times annoying, and some of it didnt make a whole lot of sense to me. Along these lines, I much prefer Byron Katie's works, and method of inquiry as path to peace. I think the Course in Miracles demonizes the Ego unnecessarily, while BK's way of observing does not. Plus I've never cottoned to religions, and The Course (and this book about The Course) has way too churchy and flowery verbage for my liking. I want to say, ""Hey Jesus, enough with the Shakespear, just talk straight.""So, this book was interesting. Not great. If you're looking for a way to peace and love, I think Byron Katie's teachings are easier to apply, and not as preachy."
1,DEFFINATELY BUY IT!!!,I shouldnt be the only poor schmuk who had to sit through it! It was excellent until the last 1/2 hour. I despise it when a movie sets a great premise and then ends horribly.I really thought this one would go the distance but the end was so campy in comparison to the rest of the movie!
1,Something fishy,Cold Steel Suggested Retail Price for this knife is 199.00 not 299.00 as suggested and reduced to 199.00.... so it is definately false advertising on the part of Sword Demon.
3,Not my style.,I bought this book on the recommendation of a friend.He and I obviously have vastly different tastes. I gave it 3 starsbecause we are friends. I am now wondering why.
4,"Great for hand strengthening, scanning, matching","I'm a pediatric occupational therapist, and this game hits on many OT goals and objectives; including hand strengthening, fine motor coordination, visual scanning, matching, and socialization involved in speaking and turn-taking. My only complaint is that sometimes two cards come out and it gets stuck."
1,Poor batter y design,"When it works, it's great. The problem is that almost every time I use it, I have to remove the two batteries, reinsert them and reinsert the battery cover. After I use it once or twice, it stops working until I repeat the above maneuver. I am not sure if it is a problem with the battery compartment design, or perhaps I am ""resetting"" the device by removing and reinserting the batteries.I tried calling tech support for assistance, but as usual, leaving a message resulted in no reply.I think Hawkings is a high quality company, and I don't understand why they don't want to give better support to this product. Until this is fixed, it is so annoying that I strongly recommend not purchasing it at this time."
4,Another great work by Jodi Picoult,"A very intriguing and thought provoking story. Try otherstories from this author such as The Pact and Harvesting the Heart...Ihave enjoyed all of this authors novels, however, the older titles are out of print and hard to find... END"
1,WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE????,"Forget Tolkien! Screw E.R. Eddison, Mervyn Peake, Edgar Rice Burroughs, and T.H. White! THIS unseemly work is the TRUE fantasy epic of our time! A cliché pastiche? Nah. Elves, Dwarves, mithril coats STOLEN from Tolkien? Oh poopoo. SCREW all those other writers who actually took the time to create their OWN creative artifice and hone their OWN literary talents! This horrid, lackadaisical tour-de-force is what people really want! Long live mediocrity! Long live Dumb&Dumb."
5,Pefect gift with a ideal cut that will knock her socks off.,"This necklace did not disappoint. It had a ideal cut that reflects light wonderfully for the glimmer you love to see especially on a sunny day.I gave this as a gift to my fiance and she loved it. Not to mention it had free shipping to boot. This made a great present, plus NETAYA and amazon gave me great updates so I knew the delivery was prompt along the way."
3,Colors of love colors of hopeless!,Gabbeh is a movie that carves in relief the terrible consequences of the way of living in those lands. It's hard to believe in this century we must assist this tragic event forged by absurd rules that can affect the destiny of a girl who wants to get marry.A crude portrait of an unexpected and ignored reality in the other side of the world.
1,Dont buy from Ireland,"this was a wast of money for me as it would not work on my computer, I also bought another Cd rom from the USA and that would not work either, the format is different but your not told this when you but from the states, expensive to ship also."
2,Not their best movie,"My two daughters and I love the Wiggles. We own about 20 DVDs, almost every one they've made. This is the only one we are not a fan of. It's just weird. My 3 year old kept asking where the Wiggles were. She didn't understand that they were animated wiggles. There is too much goofy story and not enough singing and dancing."
4,A great read,"This is a thumping good read, in the same manner as Alan Arnold's book -Once Upon a Galaxy: A Journal of the Making of The Empire Strikes Back. The author followed the film crew on their location journeys from Alberta, Canada to the warmer environs of Pinewood Studios, London. This is a fascinating tale of the hardships and highs of making a blockbuster. Packed with good observation. Too long out-of-print."
1,Who Buys This Stuff Anyway?!?!?!,"yo yo yo!!! Wut upp mah peepz?!?! YO dees noo nellie reelees iz DOPE!!?!@ it be off da heezy fo sheezy?!! me n mah homez bummp to dis in da prrkin lott of mah skool! All da girliez beeeeee imprezd! didd i menshun i bee a ritch whyt boyeee frum da subburbzzzz!!!???!!!Just kidding. If there were a scale to measure how good an album is; 1 (worst) to 100 (best); this would be in the negatives. Talk about your all-time intellectually-devoid releases. Did I mention studies show that the majority of the audience of this trash are suburban white kids? It's a sordid state of affairs. In fact, it's so pointless and dumb, I'm just gonna stop reviewing it here.I can see the hundreds of ""Not Helpful"" votes already..."
1,Wont work for 5000 or higher.,"received the keyboard, looks good but will not work with the aspire 5000 series or higher it has the wrong pigtail. the description is false. now im out 35 bucks and i have a pissed doff customer who has to wait another 3-4 days.. thanks. 1 star due to shabby listings."
5,cats love it,"I bought 2. They are very easy to put on and the cats took to them immediately to watch their ""cat tv"" view of the outdoors. I have one cat that is about 17 lbs, and the tape part that adheres to the windowsill came off after a couple of days of him jumping on them. I bought the industrial strength velcro and replaced the tape portion,and have had no more issues. I would definitely buy them again."
3,A nice mixed tape,"Wow! Is this a 70's record? That's my first thought during the first opening bars of ""E-Pro"", the campy na-na-na chorus makes this a footstomping rocksong with vamp, like Primal Scream.Track 2 on the mixtape is by Cypress Hill, including a bassline that just floats somewhere in the middle of the albumTrack 3 is an European song, probably from Sweden. At least, that's how it sounds in the beginning before it turns into an eels-song.Then it's off for some easy-tune music on ""Missing"", which could also be a Verve song.And so it continues for the rest of the albumBeck is a master-sampler. Not by taking parts of other songs, but by quoting a lot of different styles of music.Does it make for a good album? Well, in the Beck universe this album will not be seen as his greatest when we look at it again in 10 years. It doesn't have the great inventiveness of 'Mellow Gold' or the overal quality of 'Odelay'. It's certainly not bad, but not super"
4,all about timbo,"This album is all about the production. Yea, it's ""Ms. Jade's"" cd, but its nothing without the timbaland beats. If u look past the tight beats, its just mediocore spittin. Still, the beats make it a worthwhile cd, definately buy it. The top tracks are Dead Wrong, Feel the Girl, Big Head, and Ching Ching part II"
2,Diana where are you?,"In her earlier tribute to Nat King Cole, Diana Krall seemed focused on the music-that is, great jazz tunes made greater by Mr. Cole. Instead of trying to reinvent the wheel she simply sang each melody with wonderful timing, a luscious voice, and topped each off with uncomplicated but amazingly interesting piano.With this CD I was immediately struck by the fact that this recording was not about the music at all, but instead was all about Diana Krall. She seemed to be hamming it instead of singing. What happened to the melodies? Where was the piano? Where is the respect for the songwriter?Boozy drawling is OK, but Diana Krall can do much, much better than this."
5,Got Cheated,"This isn't 16oz, it's only 10oz! I was cheated out of 6 ounces, and you will be too.This works fine but you need to ventilate the area as if you were painting."
2,Greenleaf doesn't know as much as he thinks he does.,"This book is marred by some rather amazing lapses. For example, Greenleaf asserts that one's socks should match one's shoes when in fact they should match one's trousers; that single-breasted suits are more traditional than double-breasted ones when in fact the opposite is true; that a four-in-hand tie knot is a half Windsor; that a half Windsor tie knot is a full Windsor; and that a full Windsor tie knot is a double Windsor. It's not that there is no useful information in this book. It's just that Greenleaf makes too many mistakes and charges WAY too much for too little information."
5,ALL I GOTTA SAY IS...,"buy it, it's great, i love it and i can't wait to EO comes out on gamecube to see what it has to offer."
5,Facsinating and believable.,I enjoyed Yentl very much. It is an eye opener onto the private lives of strict judiasm. It should be required by all to watch.
2,Griffin disappoints--Sack Son,"I was mightily disappointed in this latest book, purported to be written by my favorite author. Where did he go? The plot was improbable, disjointed. The characters were forgettable. The theme, Our Patriotic Mobsters And How They Helped Us Win The War, is only of mild interest. I should have known that something was wrong when I looked at the author's pictures: a pair of unhappy collaborators if I ever saw one! I hate looking for another author! Come back! Please!"
4,Passion and evil abound,"Robin Schone's THE LOVER is proof that erotic romance can be about more than just sex. Ms. Schone's ability to combine explicit sex with heartbreaking emotion is astounding. I'm not a fan of erotic writing in general, however, Ms. Schone caught my attention with THE LADY'S TUTOR and did not disappoint with THE LOVER. Along with the erotic, the author doesn't skimp on emotion, characterization or plot. The underlying message in both novels is the empowerment of women in a time when women had little or no control over their own fate. It's a stunning read, although some people probably won't be able to appreciate the richness of the story because of their inability to get beyond titilation."
3,My son hates it,"I have a one year old and I have started showing him this DVD at the age of 9 months. He enjoys the colorful toys and it does capture his attention, however as soon as one of the tutors appears on the screen mouthing a certain sound he screams in horror. He's one and still has the same exact reaction. Definitely a bad buy at my end."
3,repetitive,AFter reading the first 50 pages I can already say I am thoroughly bored. Nothing has been brought up thats seems significantly new or interesting. He spends pages upon pages simply repeating the same analysis over and over. This is the second book that I have read and again I see the same defects in his writing style. It seems as if he could have written this with half the pages that he currently uses. Any decent editor should have realized this and toned down the repitition. OTher times his analysis is absent in total because of the way he structures the book. He seperates the facts too far from the analysis. This is good for organization but again leads to extreme boredom and disinterest.
4,Good for College,"You wanna burger? Just grill one up. Small enough to hide from RAs, but still gets the job done!"
2,A film where the plot was secondary to the action,"""Get Carter"" is a remake of the Micheal Caine ""Get Carter"". I think the biggest problem with ""Get Carter"" is that it focused on more of the action then the plot.""Get Carter"" is about Jack Carter (Sylvester Stallone) returning home to pay his respects to his brother who died. While home, Jack discovers that his brother may not have died due to drunk driving. This triggers a full investigation. (Stallone style)""Get Carter"" has a good plot, but I think because Stallone was the star of the film, there was a need to focus on action and by doing this, the plot was secondary.If you are the kind of person who enjoys a movie that focuses on the action while the plot fades away, you will enjoy this film."
2,Melted!,"First pair where the little nose pads and branches pads (in soft gummy plastic) simply MELTED ON ME! Was it because I had put some gel in my hair one sunny day, and wore the glasses in my hair that day? Can't tell but anyway: that really ruined the pair.I know that sounds like a joke but it is not. Sadly, besides, these are great frames and lenses."
5,Good microphones for a home made Karaoke,"These microphones were a present for my dad, who has a home made Karaoke. He was impressed with the quality of the product and especially the price because it was very cheap. He won't need to spend more money in batteries because the base includes a charger. Excellent product."
1,Get the DVD instead,"THIS IS AN EXPENSIVE AND POINTLESS CD.This is an expensive single disc CD. One side is music and the other side is enhanced so you can play the video on your computer. It is only 52 minutes long.This CD consists of the short songs from the complete concert that is featured on the DVD of the same name. This CD contains the lesser work from the concert. The only thing of interest on most of the songs, is that there is Randall Bramlett on saxophone.This show came just after guitartist Mike Howser died. George McConnell has just joined the band, but is so new, he is listed as a guest musician. He sounds out of place on most of the songs on this CD. He fits much better on the songs that were not included on the CD.Get the DVD instead. It has many great moments. The only real good song included on the CD is Rock."
2,Didn't they look around to see that disco had just died?,"Only Chicago would jump into the disco arena in late 1979 just before disco practicaly vanished as a form of popular music. Although some individual tracks such as ""Reruns"", ""Life is What It Is"" and ""Window Dreaming"" stand out, the remaining tracks leave the listener asking the question, ""Why?"" Also, Peter Cetera seems to be doing a strange imitation of Pete Puma on ""Aloha Mama"" and ""Window Dreaming"". The band sounds tired on the other tracks. Strangely, Chicago 13's disco opus ""Street Player"" has been recycled by the rap group ""The Bucketheads"" in 1995 and can be heard frequently in dance clubs. Perhaps Chicago was ahead of its time on this album after all."
3,Entertaining but Trivial,"Given all of the garbage fiction published annually, this book is an entertaining read. Good for long flights and lonely hotel nights and beach vacations. However, not a scholarly pursuit and certainly not very enlightening historically. Too many modern-day and ""politically"" correct perspectives (e.g., critical of the Inquisition and Catholic Church, only Islam is accepting of diversity, powerful and rich are assumed to be malevolent, etc.). All in all, OK but forgettable; am not compelled to read other works by author."
1,Horrible Service,Stay far away from anything to do with sportrus.com!! The service is horrible. I order 3 weeks ago. My credit card was charged the day after I ordered and I was told it would be shipped the next day - 2 weeks later still no item. I contacted sportrus.com only to find out the e-mail address I was given was invalid. I finally got a valid e-mail address from Amazon only to be told that I knew it would be delayed when I purchased and that it had continued to be on back order and the Trikk would be shipped as soon as they came in stock. So this review is about the lateral thigh trainer - I never ordered a Trikk. They also told me my credit card would not be changed until the item was ready to be shipped (right - I have been getting interest on it are they going to pay it back?) I have sent multiple e-mails asking why I was charged and still no order - they are not answering. I will never use this company again. :(
2,it's alright,"the price is alright but if you are looking for something that will last you more than a few weeks i suggest you consider looking at something else.for my purpose, i was satisfied."
2,There Have Been So Many Better Double LPs,"Having the potential to have been the strongest Beatle album to date with 12 great tracks, instead the group and George Martin put another 18 weaker songs and made this album difficult to get through. Songs like Goodnight (who cares if there is a lullaby on this?) Savoy Truffle and Long Long Long have little attraction.It is tough to produce a double album that carries its weight. Few have done it, but many are better than this. 5-stars for the 10 good songs plus 1 star for the 20 other songs = about 2 stars."
5,Fantastic- It really works,"My 18 month old son has suffered with eczema since birth and nothing that the doctor or health visitor gave him would work. He had got to the stage that he could not sleep at night for scratching and we hated seeing him in so much distress, when i saw Freederm on there website I thought it was worth giving it a go since nothing else had worked and i can honestly say that within 3 days of using the cream he had almost stopped sratching and he was sleeping through the night it is heaven in a tub."
5,Geri is a DIVA!,"I think that ""Shizophonic"" is the best CD I have listened to, to date. My favorite track on the CD is ""Mi Chico Latino"", and ""Look At Me"". If you buy the CD for the first time, make sure that u listen to ""Look At Me"" first. It gives a good idea and understanding of what the CD is gonna be, and what to be prepared for. I also like ""Walkaway"". If you listen to this, and read the lyrics while u r singing along to it, it sounds like Geri has dedicated or tributed this song to what's left of the Spice Girls. Kind of like what the Spice Girls did with ""Goodbye"". All and all this CD is definitely schizophonc(split sounds) Hope that everyone enjoys this CD!"
1,this stuff gags me,Totally dissapointed with this drink. Could not give it away! Not one person could stand it! It sounded like anyone who likes coconut would love this drink. But it is really BAD!!
5,The measure of a man...,"Everyone here has given this book five stars and I am no exception. Pilots know that flying is not just transportation but a way of learning who you really are, the stuff you are made of. This book is clearly Gann's masterwork. After reading the chapter on thunderstorms, I thought that there was just no better aviation writing and I still had half the book to go. Of course, then came the chapter on flying in ice. This alone is worth the price of the book and is probably the best aviation story every told. My hair stood on end for days... A great blend of flying, adventure and good writing."
2,Works for all kids????,"My daughter is 2 1/2 and she is not using the potty yet.. I got this book because I read good things about it on here. I got it, I did what it said, and I got NOWHERE. My daughter is delayed by a few months in her verbal communications but isnt slow by any stretch of the imagination and she didnt understand what was going on enough to get it. The potty baby was just another baby to her. She held herself the whole time she was on the potty and cried for a diaper.. She fit all the milestones and such but this didnt work for her. Dont buy it if your child is comfortable only in their diaper. My daughter wont pee in the tub or anything.. she cries for a diaper. I wouldnt buy it if your child is like this."
2,Just OK....,"I am a bath fanatic and I look for products that work with a spa tub - those that don't foam and bubble. I also like products that retain their scent through the entire bath and that soften my skin. This product fails on both counts - there is barely any scent and it does nothing to soften the water or your skin. I have used other products of Masada and have only been disappointed with this one, so far."
3,Not over the top,If you are hot for Mr. Lautner than this was a good movie for you. Just curious about the movie and his acting not a bad movie. The story is good and just enough romance. Just not a great movie. I was not bored out of my skull at any rate.
2,not what I expected,"I was very dissapointed, I did not get a chance to see it in theatres so decided to wait and watch it here...glad i did not pay theater costs..was not worth it. it was not even as close to being as good as the original."
3,Should have been a $4.99 paperback,This book would have been ok for a $4.99 paperback but should never have been a hardback. I will be more careful next time. I did not even look at it before I bought it because I buy all books by this auther. I think she is great. This is a cute holiday story but not worth hardback price.
1,Poor quality,"Similar to another reviewer, the VCR worked well but the DVD drawer did not open. I called Toshiba and they sent a replacement unit. This time the DVD worked well, but the VCR picture quality was very poor. I have now decided to return the unit for a full refund and have opted to buy DVD and VCR units separately. I had read that you sacrifice quality with a combined unit and I can attest that to be true. There are many good quality VCR's and DVD's out there at affordable prices and I now believe that is the best way to go."
5,good fit and sounds great,"for some reason this unit would not turn on for a couple of hours after i loaded it for the first time. since then it has worked excellent, it fits well and i have a large neck and head and the eq does give u a wide range. it is also ez to use the buttons while wearing it."
4,Best of the Low Carb Drinks - Highly Recommended,"Being a Type 2 diabetic and somewhat overweight, I have tried almost every low carb bar and diet shake that I could find. The Slim-Fast Low-Carb Vanilla Cream shakes are very good and are my favorite of the lot. I do like the chocholate Slim-Fast flavors better, but these are nice for variety. I have lost over 70lbs by cutting my carbs and starting a workout program (which has also helped my blood sugar levels).These shakes do fill me up for a long time and taste good enough that my kids ask for them for breakfast. We also like theAtkins Ready To Drink Shake, Milk Chocolate Delight, 11-Ounce Aseptic Containers (Pack of 12), but the Slim-Fast is a bit more filling.Highly Recommended!CFH"
2,You call this good?????,"This book was very long, and very slow. I am not one to abandon a book, but doing so to this one was very tempting. So much garbage about nothing. I agree with the reader who said BLAH BLAH BLAH. Maybe if it was shorter it may have been a little easier to swallow. The part about Domenico's book I had to skip altogether because it was bogus. I have read many books in my life and this one does not get a rave review from me. Wally Lamb should have stuck to the likes of ""She's Come Undone."" That was a great book, so good, it took less than 2 days to read. Take my advice, skip this book unless an ""Oprah"" atmosphere fascinates you."
3,Broadway songs,You need to have seen the play to appreciate these songs. A nice variety of vocalists however some of my favorite songs from the show are not included.
1,Don't bother...,God I hated this book. I don't say this lightly. I thought the idea was great and I couldn't wait to read it but...The author is so overrated and pretentious that I couldn't help but laugh at some sections. Did he even bother to give it to an editor? The characters are one-dimensional and the plot is lame. I totally lost interest half way through the book. I continued reading with the hopes that it would get better but it never did.
5,Ahhh.... relaxation,"I have these used these on and off since i was a kid. These are great for getting rid of the nervous feelings so you can sleep before your big meeting or exam, or if you just need a little extra something to put you to sleep."
2,Sizing? way off,"the color is nice. I have bought other brands of body stockings and the sizing was always perfect, plus means for a heavy woman, not tall. This is the first disappointing plus size I have gotten. It is for someone over seven feet tall not someone over 150 lbs. It should be labeled as an extra tall not a plus size. What a waste of fabric. If you are extremely tall and thin, this might be nice. If you are over 150 lbs and under six feet, do not waste your money or time."
3,More suited for Hard Style Martial artists,"This book was presented as a ""graduate-level"" course for martial artists. As a long-time Aikido practioner, I found almost all the concepts in this book consistent with basic level Aikido concepts- for me, there was nothing ""advanced"" about them. Perhaps martial artists trained in a hard style art will benefit from reading this book. But for those trained in a ""soft"" art, it will seem remedial. The last two chapters on Asian Weapons and Real World were outstanding, living up to the ""graduate-level"" billing."
3,No surprises on Dwight Live CD,"If you are a Dwight Yoakam fan, ""Dwight Live"" will give you pretty much everything you want in a live concert CD. But, because it is a ""live"" album, the sound quality isn't as great as a studio recording, and Dwight's performance is not as sharp as if he was in the studio. And it makes a difference, because Yoakam's unique sound and musicianship definitely benefits from high-quality recording and engineering."
4,Excellent product at a great price,"Recieved a month ago. Found it very comfortable and unobtrusive. Since I received it very recently, I can not comment about its durability."
1,What's up with this player,"I have had this dvd player for less than 6 months and it acts like it is 100 years old. DVD's will not play, the big and bulky battery no longer charges. Even pluged-in it spits and sputters. You press a button and nothing happens. The company is no help! BUY THE WARRANTY!!! It did work great the first 2 times I used it!"
5,Great Fantasy Book,"I recently purchased the Wilderness of Four Series, and found them to be delightful. If you like fantasy stories that involve a full range of charaters and creatures, with a mix of magic and lost history, then you love the books by Niel Hancock. I hope to soon see the new book ""The Brandigore Gate"", in bookstores soon!"
3,way to go boys,"the cd is mostly catchy songs that have a bright rock guitar sound. it is not lo-fi but rather hi-fi. all of the songs are whole songs, not just fragments like many of pollard's ""songs"". i think he could be writing commercial jingles if he didn't have any integrity. anyway, you should buy it if you like to listen to some guy from ohio sing like he's from liverpool. the opening song has a guitar solo that sounds like sonic youth. none of these songs are really that melodically breathtaking. i mean to say that there are plenty of hummable melodies and hooks but none of them are really expansive. the song ""the best of jill hives"" sounds like pollard tried to rewrite one of his best anthems ""official ironman rally song"" . i give them credit? for making an album that is consistenty mediocre. average for these guys is still way better than the best that most other contemporary rock bands can do."
1,bland and hard,Bought six pack of these two months ago and have yet to finish the first one - no matter how hungry I am I would rather go to bed hungry than eat these ...
5,A fantastic set on blu-ray!,"I have always been a fan of the intelligent wit of Wallace and his faithful dog Gromit. I did not expect to see the series on blu-ray, but it is a joy that we now have 4 of their exploits on high definition. I had to travel over 30 miles to find a store (Best Buy) with the item in stock and was able to price match Wal-Mart, making each movie just $5.I've watched two of the films so far (A Close Shave and A Matter of Loaf and death) and Wallace and Gromit has never looked or sounded better than on blu-ray. I can give a hearty thumbs up on this collection - it is well worth owning.Some items of note: This is a 1 disc blu-ray release, not 4 discs (which would not make any sense). This collection is also not ""complete"". We are missing Curse of the Were-Rabbit. Curse of the Were Rabbit has to be their best film, so it is sad that it is not included here. The films we do get are great.Movie: 5.0/5.0Video: 4.5/5.0Audio: 4.0/5.0Extras: 3.0/5.0Overall: 4.5/5.0"
2,Unrealistic Hollywood-type hype,"This DVD makes climbing Kili look like a hike in the park, and those who think it is, should try summitting via Arrow Glacier. It does have beautiful scenic shots, though."
2,I hope JAK does a better job in her new book!!,"JAK used to do this kind of romance very well. She had the very strong male lead, strong female counter-part who may be antagnostic towards one another, but have great physical chemistry; a crisis which can involve either of their respective families, work/careers or both; and a mystery that must be solved. In the Eye of the Beholder, all the ingredients are there, but JAK missed the mark. I haven't given up on her work yet and will be willing to give her next book a try. Her old books which I have been collecting through Amazon.auctions rarely disappoint."
2,Not as good as I expected,"These candies were just mediocre in flavor. When you first put them in your mouth, they taste bitter and powdery but as you chew, the flavor does improve a bit. I don't really recommend them."
5,Flashdance ballad - Grammy winner!,"Album originally released with 10 tracks. This Cd includes 3 bonus track, including ""Invitation To Dance"" (from ""That's Dancin'!"" soundtrack).Lyric sheet / booklet is no enclosed.4 tracks charted on Billboard Magazine:- ""Invisible Hands"" (Pop Singles #40, The Billboard Hot 100 #40 - 1983, The Billboard Hot 100 #97 - 1984);- ""You Make My Heart Beat Faster (And That's All That Matters)"" (Hot Dance Music/Club Play #15, The Billboard Hot 100 #54);- ""I Pretend"" (The Billboard Hot 100 #74 - 1984, Adult Contemporary #9);- ""Hurricane"" (Hot Dance Music/Club Play #16).Phil Ramone producer invited Kim to write and perform a ballad for a movie in the making titled ""Flashdance."" She co-wrote with Duane Hitchings and Craig Krampf ""I'll Be Here Where The Heart Is."" They ended up winnin' a Grammy for this song in 1984.February 1984 - Kim Carnes was nominated for a Best Pop Rock Performance (female) Grammy Awards , for ""Invisible Hands."""
5,Great!,"It is a wonderful product! It is a comforting scent that you can use any season. It does not start with the big bang, but you will periodically smell the scent through out the day when you least expect it to surprise you.It is refreshing and comforting at the same time. Do try it!"
3,"Serviceable, but not much flair","This is a very informative, detailed and sometimes humorous look at the world of waiting. It's just too bad that the telling of this potentially rich and textured tale doesn't sparkle a bit more. Ginsberg's prose is competent, but ultimately flat-footed. It's a pleasant enough read, and very educational to those not familiar with the world of waiting, but don't expect an abundance fresh or probing insights."
1,KEEP LOOKING,"""Whisper quiet?"" As compared to what, a jet engine? I bought this unit to use in about a 1200 s.f. space. Although it claims to be able to work for a larger space than that, it cannot even maintain a 35% humidity, even with the obnoxiously loud fan on high constantly. To make the room comfortable, I had to bring my other humidifier in from the bedroom, plus keep a large pot of water simmering on the stove. I will be taking this item back to the store on my next trip!!"
1,written by a dummy,"there are so many mistakes in the syntax and order of the examples that it makes it practically impossible for the beginner to try the examples and successfully execute. Aweful book, numerous errors, that prohibit the examples from being useful."
3,Faith,"I am a Christian. But I am not from a Christian family. As the matter of fast, I am from a no religious family. I have faced with lots of pressure from my family since I became a Christian.I found this book one day from your web site. I have more faith and confidence to become a Christian. I recommend to my friend."
3,Buy it for one person...,Natalie Raitano is HOT!!! Pam Anderson can't hold a candle to Natalie; that's the only reason I can think to purchase this dvd collection.
3,Missing major songs,"After The Knack released ""Get the"", they instantly became my favorite band. I still to this day enjoy listening to the entire album. Although I lost interest after thier 2nd album (mainly because of the introduction Harder/Glam Rock like Van Halen, Scorpions, Iron Maiden, Def Leppard, etc) they still should have been supported better than they were. The reason I'm only giving ""Best of"" 3/5 stars is the lack of other songs off of ""Get the"" such as my favorite ""She's so (Selfish)"", ""The Monkey and me"", ""Frustrated"" and ""Maybe Tonight"". If you don't own any Knack, your better off buying ""Get the"" instead of ""Best of"". Don't agree? Read the other reviews."
5,I couldn't put it down,This is one of the best books I have ever read. It is upsetting and confusing at times but that is what makes it so good. Some parts certain people can relate to and certain parts some people can't. It has you intrigued forever. Read it 6 times...
5,LOVE THESE!,"These baskets are awesome! We have a really strange shower without much space around the tub for bottles etc. Just a towel rack inside the shower, which is the perfect place to hang these. I bought two- one for the rack and one for the curtain rod- I was initially worried that the baskets would swing too much on the rod but they definitely stay put. There are drain holes at the bottom of each basket so they don't fill up with water and soap goo, and they're deep so that bigger or heavy bottles don't tip the basket and fall out. There are suction cops on the back of each basket, and the top hooks are rubberized so they don't slip- which is a plus. I love them so much I bought a few more for friends and family."
3,Not your typical pastry chef,"Read like a farce on typical horror/mystery books, and I enjoyed all the tongue in cheek and pastry references.Easy non-scary read, bizarre characters, unusual reactions and life stories, quite odd from beginning to end.That's what kept me reading it, wanted to see what other twists sprung out of nowhere."
4,Almost Complete Monty Python,"Contrary to what the title of this set suggests, this is not the complete Monty Python's Flying Circus. One cut has been made: in episode 38 the opening sketch ""Party Political Broadcast (Choreographed)"" and the closing trailers ""Dad's Doctor"" and ""Dad's Pooves"" have been cut... TWO cuts have been made: in episode 38 the opening sketch ""Party Political Broadcast (Choreographed)"" and the closing trailers ""Dad's Doctor"" and ""Dad's Pooves"" have been cut, as well as a line in episode 33's ""Biggles Dictates A Letter""... THREE cuts have been made... Actually more than three.On the plus side, some of the DVDs contain sketches from the rarely seen German episodes as bonus material, so I give this set three sta.., er, FOUR stars..."
5,The Legend of Sleepy Hallow starring Jeff Goldblum,"This is such a great movie!! Jeff Goldblum was perfect for the part of Ichabod Crane as well as all the other actors!! Why hasn't this been put on DVD yet? Our grandchildren are not able to watch the copy we have on VHS. Isn't there a way we can get it moved up with the times. It's something that shouldn't get lost, it's a wonderfully done version of ""The Legend of Sleepy Hallow"" and such a great story. Our young children as well as older grandchildren should be able to see this every Halloween season. It isn't even shown on T.V. anymore. What can we do?Maggie"
1,King scares me for the wrong reasons,"Stephen King used to be a master at the macbre, but now he seems to be a master at insanity and perversion."
2,Eau du Anti-Histamines,"I'm sorry, but this is another pop-star fragrance that I really don't care for (another being Britney Spear's ""Curious"").I was given a sample of it at Walgeens the other day. It's too sweet smelling for my tastes (my mother said it smelled like air freshener), and I think I had an allergic reaction to it.I got a rash. Also, that night I woke up to find my left eye was starting to swell shut (I had not even sprayed it on my skin that time). After removing contaminated articles of clothing and using hydrocortizone, symptoms vanished within an hour. Take that, Hillary Duff."
4,"Good Set, Lousy Storage","We bought this set for our 4 1/2 year old son for Christmas. He's been playing with it non-stop for a week now. This is a good set for any kid that wants to make vehicles, since it contains four sets of wheels.The one thing that prevents me from giving this 5 stars in every category is that the tub it comes in doesn't have a lid! Why Lego would give you a tub with no lid is beyond me!"
3,Interesting Concept but Repetitive,"This book introduces interesting concepts on economics and simple examples of how it affects the real world. The best part of this book is the fact that the author's style makes the reader think in strange ways to understand the concept presented. The main downside of this book is that too much repitition is used to simplify what the author is trying to get across. Overall, although exceptionally written, this book was not meant to have mass appeal, and it shows."
2,Disappointed,Text looks grainy.Using Clear type makes it looks even worst.I had chance to compare it with Sony 18'LCD side by side - can't compete.
5,Telling The Matter As It Is,Mrs. Malkin has a talent for stating facts in an interesting way and documents her references with 37 pages of notes. The unhinged ones probably have had their lawyers spend much time looking for a mistake.
1,Outdated. Worthless.,"Pretends to be written by practitioner, so my expectations were quite high.Alas, it is actually written in dry academic style, with lots of useless top-level outlines.As of 2012, most of practical techniques referred there are very outdated.Do not buy it."
4,AAAaaaaahhhhh....,This is exactly what I was looking for! It was hard finding a moist heating pad specifically for the shoulder/lower neck area. The only thing I would change or modify later is to have a greater range of adjustment on the velcro closure.
3,Good Read...in paperback,"First, the book is a good read, and if you remain unbiased, you can credit Zinn for his views, and appreciate he leaned a little (well, a lot) left of center.But folks... the paperback is 50% the cost of the kindle edition.This is a kindle e-book to ban."
2,Get something else!,"The beaker is cheaply made and broke with a little tap through washing. Amazon will send this to you in a box with no packing, just the raw press! I used a chopstick to stir the coffee and treated this glass with care, but it's too thin and not tempered. Replacement part is expensive in comparison to the original press. Made great coffee, but only lasted a few weeks. Get something else!"
4,BLURAY,WHEN WATCHING AN OLDER MOVIE ON BLURAY ITS JUST A LITTLE BETTER THAN DVD... BUT A GOOD COMPONENT TO YOUR STARWARS COLLECTION
1,Doesn't Fit the battery holder.,I received the battery fast. However it doesn't fit the space of the battery holder with my Lumix camera. I am going to return it.
2,Audio= Very Poor,First time I have purchased a DVD that had a 4 star+ rating and been disappointed. The front speakers and center channel were OK. The rear was terrible. The overall audio quality was the worst I have heard. Listened to it once and went back the next day thinking my set up had to be wrong. Tried two other DVD's and both were fine. Suggest you try something else.
3,Doesn't compare to the first but still ok,"This movie follows the final stages of the battle between humans and machines and the choices Neo must face. In the beginning, Neo is in a place between the matrix and reality called the train station. I won't tell you anymore because it would spoil the movie. I thought the fight between Neo and Agent Smith was well done but the ending seemed underdone. But it was still a movie I would reccomend to see in theaters. Overall, it's not as good as the first two (the first one being the best) but it is still a movie that sticks to the story and sort of completes the matrix regime."
1,Waste of money!,"This review is about: ""Understanding by Design - Study Guide"". I bought this book, because the reviews suggested it was the real thing. But it is a thin volume with study questions for the original.A lot of money wasted, because there is no way to send it back from Germany."
5,The beginner ones are actually gentle enough for me!,"I have fibromyalgia, and was encouraged by my doctor to look into Qi Gong, as a low impact work out to gently, gradually work myself into shape. I can actually do these! When I'm able to get the toddlers to stay back so I'm not tripping on them, I can get through the whole session of the beginners' movements. Only problem is finding a time when the tots are out of the way."
2,Just okay,"I purchased this product hoping to ""greenly"" ease the work of having to prevent and remove the snow on the steps and porch at my Colorado home. The sprayer is not worth buying. Get one from your local hardware store. The product itself is a temporary ( very temporary) for keeping the snow off. Plus it did not melt a thin layer of ice. For me , it was not worth the money and time it takes to apply. Bought a new shovel instead."
5,Small yet powerful!,The rice cooker is smaller than I had pictured it when I placed the order yet we are satisfied with the results it has given us. It may be a bit slower than my last cooker but still faster and more convenient than stove top cooking and tender moist rice is always the result!
2,keyboard terrible,We purchased two of these computers and they are both the same. The keyboards are very hard to use. You have to hold the fingers almost 90 degrees to get the keys to work. I end up typing a message and then have to go through and fill in all the letters that the keyboard did not type. I sent mine back and got a Fujitsu it is great
1,I Was Actually Glad When It Was Over,"Let's just say that some works don't hold up well over time. This was little more than a poorly written 96 minute music video. On a deeper level it is said to have reflected the growing despair that the Beatles felt as their career(s) took over their lives. In any event, it comes across as forced, a hastily written script that gave the Beatles another go at the silver screen. A Hard Day's Night was much better; it rocks while this one reeks."
3,Clean,"They had two double-platinum albums and three Top Ten singles, one of the most popular late 80s metal bands. This album Cherry Pie, clean or not, is one of their best, even though it came in 1990. Later albums failed to chart, outiside of one gold album. Key tracks are: Cherry Pie, Uncle Tom's Cabin and I Saw Red. Not a bad group nor a bad album."
1,Go buy a Kid's Practice Pole Instead! Zero Stars,This product was terrible. It broke after 4 uses. I bought a $10 2' child's fishing rod instead & attached a mouse. Works like a champ for going on 2 months now. Don't waste money on this.
5,UNIQUE APPROACH TO AN OLD THEME,"I give Kostova 4 stars because she approached the dead (pardon the pun) Dracula theme in a wonderfully refreshing way. If readers are expecting Anne Rice or Bram Stoker gore, forget it. In fact, she makes mockery of the Hollywood vampire approach. Kostova thankfully doesn't focus on the vampiristic gore that flavors so many Dracula books, but rather delivers an intelligent tome which 'sucks in' and satisfies readers on ahistorical, yet suspenseful vein. I loved it and couldn't put it down! Bravo to Ms. Kostova!!"
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY.,"IF I COULD MAKE MY DECISION AGAIN KNOWING WHAT I KNOW NOW, I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT SOMETHING DIFFERENT. THIS PRODUCT MIGHT BE FINE IF YOU CAN STAND UNDER YOUR CAR AND USE TWO HANDS. HOWEVER LAYING ON YOUR BACK IN YOUR YARD THIS PRODUCT SUCKS. IT IS NOT EASY TO USE ONE HANDED...I HAVE YET TO BE ABLE TO USE IT IN REMOVING A FILTER FROM A CAR YET. PLIERS HAS BEEN MY BEST TOOL TO USE. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GET A GOOD PAIR OF OIL FILTER PLIERS, THEY WONT FAIL YOU."
1,Put this book back in the time capsule,"This book is an antique. I found this book to be completely dated and unhelpful. Unless your are Schecky Green and going out on tour on the Catskills comedy circuit don't buy this book. If you plan on opening with ""Take my wife, please"", then you will find this book very helpful, if not then don't bother...RKC"
2,Don't buy it!,"This album makes me upset. There was a beautiful wonderful album already released with the brilliant Donna Murphy and then the producers put this out to compete with it? Why would they do that? Get the one with Donna Murphy, you won't regret it."
3,A good first try,"At first this is a FRUSTRATING game. Help/documentation is almost non-existant. After a bit of floundering the game can be figured-out, but then new frustrations set in. There are limitations on the number of runways and towers; who knows why. The game takes forever to finish...more defined goals such as are seen in RR Tycoon would help a lot. The graphics aren't very good.Having said all that, I still do play it on occasion."
5,Arthritis Gloves,The gloves work as advertised. They provide relief and allow me to do finger exercises with a minimum of discomfort.
1,Disappointing,"Chose this stapler based on the name and the reviews. Worked for a while and then the pencils began being sharpened on one side only! In addition, now it runs constantly if you don't remove the shavings draw. I will be ordering a different brand."
1,Quackery,"Aside from a possible placebo effect.. This stuff will do NOTHING to help you sleep. Youll probably have better results taking 4 cheerios. The ""medicine"" is too diluted to have any effect.. Its like tossing a tossing a tic tac into the Pacific ocean and expecting a cup of it to give you fresh breath. Ive seen researchers consume the ENTIRE box of these Before their lectures to prove that it has no effect at all. Its 2010, people."
2,Not so great,"A reviewer before me said it perfectly: A gummy, uneven mess. When trying to apply to skin, you run into numerous clumps of gel that won't smooth out. The color is great, though the Perfectly Pink is really more of a plum and not at all what I'd call pink. I love the color, but don't want to risk walking out of the house with a hyper-pigmented unidentifiable bit of goo on my face."
4,Nice reminder....,Cute book. It's a nice reminder...not just for your kids but for adults too. Sometimes we need to be reminded to look at the bright side of things and not to search for things to be angry about.
4,Great little fan,"Good airflow capacity. Multiple flow levels and direction allows greater seasonal use . Temp control works great ,especially on those cool down nights. The fan on full hi is a bit loud at night . I typically turn down on low which provides plenty of airflow and very quite"
4,Billy's Best,"I'm not much of a billy joel fan, but this is really a remarkable album. Up there with Joni Mitchell's 'Miles of Aisles' as an endearing document to Joel's uncorrupted talent.Unfortunatley, Joel veered towards schmaltzy commercialism almost immediatley after this album's release (although 'the Nylon Curtain,' which came after this, was pretty good).These songs are personal, almost auto-biographical. There is romantacism to tracks like 'Summer Highland Falls,' with 'You're My Home' being perhaps the best song Joel has written."
3,Sinatra without the warts.,"First, you have to understand it's not a biography. Actually the book's premise is summed up very well by the Sinatra quote on the dust jacket. ""I think my real amibition is to pass on to others what I know. It took me a long, long time to learn what I now know, and I don't want that to die with me."" I think this book does that very well using a series of ancedotes culled from Mr. Sinatra himself as well as others. It covers things such as the Las Vegas ""Rat Pack"" years, his style of dress, his code of conduct, his loyalty to friends. The book succeeds in what it was meant to do, but to get a real feel for the total man I'd suggest reading one of the many fine biographies that are out there. Whether you love or hate Frank Sinatra you'll have to admit he was a very complex man who lived life on his own terms. This book will give you some insights into what drove him to be the way he was."
3,Look for kits,"The product is ok, but considering the price, I would suggest to look for toolkits which offer more bang for the buck."
1,Great Music this isn't. . . .,"Religion can clearly have a place in great music....Rock and Roll owes more than a little to it's Gospel roots. But this CD from the Pope is little more than background church music. It may be inspiring in a religious way to certain people, but listened to critically, it is little more than New Age at it's absolute worst."
5,Doors fans this is a must have,"This told the story about The Doors through their years up until Jim Morrison died sadly. It gave me a whole new look in the band. Val Kilmer delivers in the great role as one of the best rock and rollers of our time. The Doors have some of the best songs out there and it protrays on how some songswere written. Great DVD..Buy it! I did, It was worth the money! A++"
1,Impossible to get hold of - author unhelpful,"I've heard this book is great but personally I or anyone else within my organisation wouldn't know because acquiring it has become one of the most difficult and convoluted exercises I have had to deal with in the past few years. I tried to purchase via many a bookstore then Amazon, B&N etc etc and then direct via the publisher - who are 'Human Rights Press' anyway??? When this fly-by-night publisher was evidently uncontactable via their very professional hotmail email address, as a last resort, we contacted the author direct. Things looked promising for a while, he offered to help, took my details but then started to ignore my emails when I inquired as to why the work, as promised, never showed up. One would think he would show some good faith considering who we are in the human rights field. I will never again attempt to purchase any work by this author."
4,The Moon Handbook worked for us,"We used the Moon Oregon Handbook for guidance on a driving trip from the eastern border of Oregon near Boise, ID, to Bend OR via US 26, (stayed 3 nights) and on to Silverton (1 night) and Portland (5 nights). We appreciated the book's advice to see John Day fossil beds-Painted Hills, the High Desert Museum, Oregon Gardens, Silver Falls State Park. We wished the guide had mentioned the times of services at Mount Angel Abbey. We dropped off the rental car when we first arrived in Portland and never missed it afterwards. Though the book mentions the city's ""excellent mass transit"" it neglected to say that it is free (!) downtown. Overall, though, we were quite satisfied with the scope, accuracy and tone of the book and we loved this slice of Oregon."
3,"Nothing Compared to ""Picaresque""","All bands have to find themselves. This album is searching. And ""Picaresque"" is finding."
3,Pretty design but too small,"Perhaps I did not carefully read the dimensions if they were posted. Although these are beautiful earrings, they are too small to really enjoy their beauty."
4,The Leonard Nimoy segment,"Nimoy comes to Charlie Rose with an autobiographical volume called ""I am Spock"". He had previously written volume called,""I am not Spock"". Spock was the fictional character Nimoy played on the television space- epic 'Star-Trek'. He speaks about his role, his relationship with co- star William Shatner, his belief that there is an extraterrestial life, a novel he is writing about an extra- terrestial who comes to study human society, his own gratitude that he has been able to make a career in acting.This is a low - key conversation with a modest professional whose success apparently has not gone to his head."
4,The Christmas Shoes,"Although ordered at the same time as the two other movies I purchased, approx. (Dec. 19), this one arrived only last week (approx a month later) seems an awfully long time and not sure why."
2,Not the best I've ever read...,"This book is not terribly enlightening. Most of the advice is just practical common sense. However, it is worth reading for the advice on using coupons and finding discounted products. I would consider this book to be supplemental reading at best. There are much better books out there on managing finances and getting out of debt."
3,Not as Good,"I'm sorry but this is not a 5-star album. OK Computer is a fantastic and lyrically and instrumentally stimulating CD. The Bends is good, but not great. Let's be honest, they did not come into their own until OK Computer and Kid A. The album is good, but the instrumentals are weak compared to a lot of other CDs."
1,So Uncomfortable and must pay own shipping to return inferior product,"Our family adore the original design, without the dropdown seat. I cannot even find enough NEGATIVE superlatives to describe how uncomfortable this company's newly designed drop down pajama is. Do not buy them. you will only spend time repackagine, returning and paying to ship a product that should not be sold until they make them comforatable - as pajamas are to be."
3,"Great fun, but not for kids","I like Jeff, or is it Heff (Jalepeno on a stick) and I bought this as soon as it was available. The theme is dark for a Christmas special, and much of the material is more adult oriented. Some things that really bothered my twelve year old was the recurring references to drugs, sex and swearing. Don't get me wrong-there's some funny stuff for sure, but this is better suited for the grown-ups.Overall, you're better off getting the CD called Don't come home for Christmas. It has a lot more music, only one bleeped swear and no drug references (except beer)."
2,new copier cartridge light on ink,"From the get-go this supposedly new toner cartridge [[ASIN:B000AYMPT0 Canon E 20 - Toner Cartridge - 1 X Black - 2000 Pages] was different from those used in the last 17 years in this extremely nice, durable Cannon photo copier. It copies everything way lighter than ever before. Plus, it's a waste of paper figuring where to set the darkness level. I'm betting it doesn't last long and I'll have purchase a new cartridge..."
2,Disappointing,"As a longtime fan and follower of the Dragonlance Saga, I can only call this 4th and heavily belated installment of Chronicles to be a major disappointment. Gone is the sense of purpose and adventure that made the original Chronicles and Legends trilogies so gripping. In its place is this, which almost reads like a comic book, with characters coming back to life and being taken away just as quickly. Most of the ""offspring"" characters developed in the Tales stories are killed off rather quickly, and other characters like Palin and Steele are not dealt with well either. Add to that the almost total destruction of the Krynn we all know from prior novels, and this is one fantasy disaster.For my part, I've tried to forget this was ever written, and until better comes along am sticking with the Legends trilogy as the final major chapter involving the heroes of the lance."
4,What an amazing story,I wasn't sure what to expect when the story began to unfold. This was an incredidbly vivid journey and I loved nearly every minute of it. The reason for only four stars- I still don't know what to make of the ending. Which version of the story do I want to be true? I may have to read it again to decide.
4,Return policy great!,"Unfortunately, my gravy boat had a broken handle, but I was able to return it in exchange for a new one. It was in great condition."
3,Suggested improvement.,The product works but could be improved if they added a large pocket on the inside to hold the accesories.
4,"Buy new, not refurbished","The player, itself, is great. You can drag and drop music easily without the need for another program. This is my 2nd one because the first one I bought (refurbished) constantly froze and the headphone jack began failing. If you want a big enough MP3 player for cheap, get this one, and buy some better headphones too."
4,gifts,"looked likes lots of fun, gave them to my 4 yr old nephews and they were excited. didnt get to hear yet if they had fun with them."
1,Just No Good,"I gave this book a star because I think that anytime an author is able to write, finish, and publish a novel, he or she should be commended, but that's about it.This novel had a lousy premise and was, in all respects, so incredibly silly that I only finished it because I hate putting books down in the middle.First, I think that the authors, who should not quit their day jobs, should really see a different editor. Second, I think that the author should really think hard about how to write a cliffhanger ending (as this book is clearly meant to be the first in a series), third, I think that the authors should stick to writing Star Wars novels.Don't read this book. I promise that if you are a thinking person, you will be sorry if you do."
3,santana?,"this cd is okay but not great. as a fan of the old santana i found it hard to sit through some of the guitar melodies as they were shot down by overated pop stars. this is not to say that it is all bad, at times the mixture of guitar and vocals (such as the song with wyclef) turn out to be alright.Also wasn't the point of ""santana"" the great guitar backed up by like 20 drummers? the drumming in this album is so weak.."
1,worn out after 3 months' use,"Very disappointed! Bought a new one in Aug. for my Son, after 3 months' use (about 3 wears/week), it is completely worn out!"
2,The Battery is Worthless!,"The blower seems decent, however what kills this product is the battery. I only used the blower four times, and then after that the battery could not hold a charge. Unfortunately I'm past the return policy date or else I would return it. I'm so dissapointed in this product."
1,Solutions manual - too many errors,"I bought this book thinking that it would help me verify the answers, but in fact there are too many errors in the book. I have found a lot of problems out of sequence, and a lot of them not properly done. I have contacted the author to mention about the errors but haven't heard from him yet."
5,Intelligent and satisfying,"I've just discovered the Gregor Demarkian series and SKELETON KEY is definitely the book that will make me go back and read the earlier ones. Vivid characters, an intricate yet coherent plot, and a totally likable hero are all the ingredients that make mystery lovers sigh with pleasure. Not to be missed by those who appreciate a crackling good story."
5,"Leonardo, the Terrible Monster",the illustrations and the typography are amazing. and of course the story is alot of fun as well.
5,I love it!,"I got this book from the library, and now I'm about to order it its so good. In the starting its kind of stupid...because they fall in love almost emediantly.But after wards its almost perfect! Its very unique in that there maried threw most of the book so thats nice because usually books end were he asks her to marry him and....The End But this ones different! Mrs.Chaiken has a talent for writing fasinating books were there all diferent but you can tell there written by the same person.I love it"
2,Not what I needed...,"I was looking for something to get canned sodas really cold--so cold that they border on freezing. This doesn't even come close. Science isn't my bag, so I clearly expected too much. It may be fine at chilling wine, but I didn't try that."
3,pretty good but I stil have a backache,like it. Its okay still a bit wierd but i guess its good for my spine.
1,soul catcher,this video was boring and not at all enjoyable. rent this movie first and you will see that it is not worth buying
5,Greatest brawling game ever!,"I got this for my birthday and I've loved it every minute. It has several modes for single or multiplayer. There's story mode, tournament mode, and an all-out free-for-all. I would recommend this game to everyone. If you don't have it, IT'S A MUST!ScoreGameplay 8.9Graphics 9.7Overall 9.3"
1,Not Working at ALL........,I bought this item for my wife. She open that box and take it out and kept on her table. Lateron when she wants to use it she turn it on. Noene of the items works. Nor CD or Radio works. I tried to return the items but the return date expire. DO NOT BUY cheap items. DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUYDO NOT BUYDO NOT BUYDO NOT BUYDO NOT BUYDO NOT BUYDO NOT BUYDO NOT BUYDO NOT BUYDO NOT BUYDO NOT BUYDO NOT BUYDO NOT BUYDO NOT BUYDO NOT BUYDon't waste your money
5,Sports Bra,This is a great sports bra. Comfortable from the moment you put it on until you take it off. Recommend
1,Macon County Line,"I'm always intersted in movies about the ""OLD"" South and the way things were before the sixties. While I enjoyed the story, but the foul language always disappoints me in a movie. I have heard all the F'n words, but don't need to hear it coming from my TV."
2,Not the best biography of Robert La Follette,"The are pluses and minuses to Davis Thelen's biography on Wisconsin's ""Fighting Bob"" La Follette.The biggest plus, it was short (211 pages) and to the point. Not filled with mindless babble about every little personal detail of the man's life, like you see some biographers write.The book also shows, in Thelen's opinion, how La Follette was really out to be get re-elected, in the earliest years of his political life, rather than become the insurgent leader of the people. According to Thelen that came later, not from the onset.The biggest minuses were that it focused way to much on the progressive insurgence movement. While this was a major part of La Follette's life it was not everything! Some of Thelen's views are also very controvesal and subject for much debate.If your looking for a quick overview of progressivism, insurgency, and Robert La Follette then this is the book for you. If you are looking for details you will be disappointed."
4,How to grow your own,"Another excellent book on the health and medical benefits of marijuana, a herb that has been around hundreds of years and would truly help man kind if the politics and Medical- drug cartels were banned instead of this plant. Read and see for your self the lies we have been told over the years."
2,catalog mag,I have subsribed to all the r/c mags for some time.This mag has become a glorified catalog for the adertizers.it used to be a real good mag once.
5,Still use this after nearly 10 years!,"I was given this book nearly 10 years ago, in college, when going to a yoga class was finacially out of the question. Even with all of the DVD's that are out there now, I will still go back to this book for reference often. A person just needs to remember to take this book in stride, you do what you can, and work into what you can't do."
1,did not work,"I bought this item to keep my son from sucking on his fingers. It did not affect him, in fact he kept wanting to put it on. Lol."
5,Great for children,"My 2 1/2 year old twins LOVE this book. The illustrations have prompted conversations and learning that they never would have had otherwise. I actually especially like the human anatomy pages. The non-sexual nature of the pictures makes it easy to talk to your children about the human body in a matter-of-fact way. They both know the difference between a boy and a girl, know that their baby brother was in my stomach, and understand the basics of the digestive and circulatory systems!Also, the other illustration-packed pages have taught them SO much. They know the names of instruments, animals, tools, and vehicles. The cool thing is that it lets you explain whatever catches their fancy. Anyway, I love this book. It's one of the best impulse purchases I've ever made."
1,Predictable and poor,"I found this book to be very shallow , the characters where not believable and reminded me of the type of B rate TV movie that you may stop and watch on a rainy Sunday when you have nothing better to do. The characters had no depth and I really struggled to empathise with them. The quality of the writing was questionable and one line for me sums it up and I quote ""the rain fell from the clouds"", this was the description of a storm and unfortunatley the descriptive prose did not get much better than that. The plot was predictable and you could see the ending virtually from the beginning. Unfortunately not my type of book... obviously others have enjoyed it much more than me."
2,"""just another adventure game""","I concur with Derek. There's really nothing standout about this game. You've seen almost all of the puzzles before, some of which are particularly irrelevant to the plot. The voice acting is pretty good and the dialogue is just so-so...and both are downright poor with respect to the parts of the game that take place in 1920's Prague. (Neither the characters' vocabulary or dialect suggest they're from anywhere but present-day America.) And the story of hunting down a serial killer has been done to death. But the graphics are beautiful, especially the in-game paintings (which are central to the game), and the decked-out killer himself.If you want an innovative adventure game that broadens your horizons, check out The Indigo Prophecy (aka Fahrenheit)--which actually is another serial killer story, but much more interesting in every way--or, even better, get Grim Fandango."
5,Beautiful in every way!,"The journey toward inner strength and joy continues with this marvelous book. Learning ways to balance your energies, to achieve centricity - that's the key to achieving your life goals and personal desires. Esther and Jerry have done it again in this book that teaches us about the processes of true manifestation. Wonderful!"
4,Same old good hash!,"It's just another one of those compilations which will only look good if you're an intensely obsessed Donna Summer collector. Otherwise, you'll be more than adequate having her anthology album. This is the sixth compilation I have of pretty much the same songs--Enough is Enough! Now, where's that new album she's been promising us since 99? The reason this made four stars, in my opinion, is simply because the sound quality is exquisite-- a true rarity with German-pressed CDs; but, note that this is most definitely not the ideal compilation to have of Donna. Actually, it's too daunting to compress her range in a single 'best of' album. It simply can't be done."
3,Lovely but Short,"This music was lovely to listen to, but it was a very short cd compared to what I usually find on cds, classical or otherwise. I also felt there were very few ocean sounds for a composition that highlighted them in the title. Nice, but worth listening to ahead of time if possible to see if it's really what you're looking for."
4,quite good!,"howdy y'all,this is a rather fine, quick meal. i prefer it with sliced, grilled sausage and chuncked chicken breast added, but it is enjoyable on its own. quick to cook, easy to cook ... and it tastes good! [*grin*]rated a FOUR since it does all that i expected _plus_ it tastes better than expected.take care,lee"
5,Bolling Spreads His Wings,"With this, the second in a series of jazz-classical fusion collections, Bolling has reached new heights. Every single piece is refreshingly original - no repeats are duds in this collection.The style and expression are both freer and more intense - indeed this seems more ""musical"" in many ways. Once again it is almost impossible to select a ""favorite"" although JAZZY and AMOURESE are two that stand out. The sound is sheer perfection but it is the inventive aspect of the series that makes this collection shine."
3,extra wires,the connectors was a little loose and they had more wires than needed. there are 4 wires that are blanks on all the 94-98 jetta's instead of leaving them blank they put wires in them and call them mute wires. well installing a stereo you need room so i cut them out.
3,They'd Be Comfortable If They Fit,"I ordered these when they were a Lightning Deal. Was in the market for some new slippers and after reading most of the positive reviews, I decided to try them out. Two days later they arrived and I couldn't wait to try them on. I wear a size 10 always. Never a 9.5 and never a 10.5. These slippers were way too small. I called to place a return and was hoping to exchange them for a larger size to try. For whatever reason, the good folks at Amazon never made the offer. They were nice enough to pick up the tab for the return postage. I guess I'll never know how they really feel."
5,The BEST book on Mutual funds you can Buy,"Love this book for two reasons. First, it has lots of unique and non-intuitive things to say about mutual funds and investing. Second, John says those things in such a definitive, persuasive and compelling way that he has persuaded me that he's right. This book will change the way you invest, increasing returns and lowering risk at the same time. This is no get-rich-quick scheme. It's also a mud-pie in the face of the mutual fund industry which typically skims 1.5% from your assets before you get any returns."
4,Nighty,"This item came in a timely manner and I was satisfied with the item as well, the only con is that the shipper used the postal service instead of UPS on the shipping"
4,For Holly Dunn Fans,"There is nothing extraordinary on this album, just pleasant country music of the type one usually expects from Holly Dunn. Her fans will surely enjoy this CD which contains the following tracks:1. No Love Have I2. If Your Heart Can't Do The Talking3. Golden Years4. You Say You Will5. I Laughed Until I Cried6. As Long As You Belong To Me7. Let Go8. I've Heard It All9. Half A Million Teardrops10. You Can Have Him11. A Simple I Love You"
4,Full Disclosure,"While I am sure that this product will be a huge hit in our household, we have yet to assemble it. I was not aware that depending on the size of your tree, you may have to buy an additional strap extension for another $11. So, as a word of warning, you'll need to measure your tree first before you order the product. Be prepared to pay more."
2,What size is it?,"This table looks great, but I can't consider buying it because I have no idea what size or how tall it is."
2,BAM! disgraces the PPG's.,"As much as I like the PPG's and an advocate for the resurrection of the Rowdyruff Boys, I'm disappointed with this game. First of all, I enjoy the fact they're finally in a 3D environment, but the story is just, well, pathetic. This is supposed to be a fighting style type game. Not the best fighting game I've seen. If BAM! wanted to make a really good fighting game with the PPG's, they should do it in the style like Capcom's Marvel vs. Capcom 2. That would really get my attention. Another thing I don't like, where are the rest of the characters? Where's the rest of the Gangreen Gang and the Rowdyruff Boys? BAM! really held out in that department. In the simulator mode, why can't you pit a PPG against another PPG? I like a little sibling rivalry. That's just stupid. If gamers like the PPG's, don't get this game. Stick to the Gameboy Color and Advance games...they're more challenging."
5,Great!,"I'll start by saying that I've read a fair amount of books in my day. This book, for its genre, is probably the best (second would probably be The Circle of Innovation by Tom Peters) that I've read.I'm honestly AMAZED by how concisely he communicates points in a matter of paragraphs that would take other authors entire books.There also haven't been all that many books where I've started to laugh out loud in the middle of. I really like this guy's way of getting straight to the point."
1,Smells HORRIBLE,"I rarely leave Amazon reviews but I had to chime in to agree with the 2-star review: this lotion smells nothing like honey or orange and everything like plastic and chemicals. So disgusting that after putting it on my arms and legs and letting it sit for a few minutes, I had to get up and go take a shower to get it the heck off of me. My husband admitted he hated it as much as I did. Seriously gross.I gather from all the positive reviews that perhaps it's one of those lotions you either love or hate the scent of... but just be forewarned that, like me, you may be in the latter group. What a waste of $7."
5,Barry Roars Back!,"This CD is a great and righteous throw-back to simpler times. The arrangements are elegant and serve Barry's voice particularly well. His version of ""Venus"" seems to explode from the CD as Barry is accompanied by what the CD describes as a ""Heavenly Choir"" - featuring the incredible voice(s) of one Connie Nassios. This one's a winner!"
5,This movie is good...,"I don't know where one gets that Lou Diamond Phillips is in this, because he isn't. However the storyline is set as it is in the old myths...The bride is poisoned on her wedding day by the main character's rival and he goes into Haedes to bring her soul back. They fight ***yes Hellhounds*** and such along the way, and it does have a lot of action in it. Yes, there are gory scenes so it's not for the kiddies...If you remember the song ""Don't Pay the Ferryman"" from the '80's you will have a good idea what myth that this film originates from. The acting was well done in it, and I enjoyed seeing Ben Cross in this one. He played the part of the king well. I guess the other reviewer didn't get into it because he didn't get the plot. Those of you who are into the Greek Mythology and such will like it, I think...Rick Schroder did an excellent job directing these actors too. There was no overacting. The make up and costumes were good as well."
4,Good Product,"Really great for the tiny ice cubes. I don't try to bend or anything to get them out. Instead I grab a big bowl and smack it gently, letting the ice cubes drop into the bowl. Worked well for me."
1,Remastering Error To Be Aware Of,"The song ""On The Run"" has a remastering error at about 2:03 into the song where it 'skips'. It's a defect in the master CD that was copied to all the retail CDs. The band is aware of it as the following was posted on their web site: ""We are aware of the glitch in 'On The Run' and told Sony not to let it out like that but they had already shipped a bunch out - needless to say we are not happy about it at all. You can imagine how we feel when we spent so much time on putting together a great package to find out that once it left our hands not very much care was taken - all we can do is apologise and hope it doesn't spoil The Re-Masters for you. Still I suppose it's par for the course as we always had these sort of problems with labels! Jayne Andrews -- Management Co-ordinator for JUDAS PRIEST."" I'm rating this remaster as 1 star until the error is fixed (which I hope will happen at some point)."
2,Choppy writing and unlikable characters,"Maybe this book lost a lot in the translation, but this book comes across as written by an author who has no idea how people interact with one another. The relationship bewteen Rebecca and Saana is stilted and the dialouge is awful.The basic plot is okay, but I suspect part of the author's message is to bash Christian fundamentalists. Ultimately the idea that 3 people acted together is too unbelievable. Very surprising that this book won an award. The final suggestion of a relationship between Rebecca and her boss is also pretty ridiculous."
1,I managed to fix it...,"Our set worked for a total of 30 seconds on Christmas morning. Luckily, we had a plane to catch so my son couldn't dwell on it.I followed the advice of another reviewer here and glued a couple of the internal parts together (their review describes the process accurately). So far it's holding up fine. Mattel offered a voucher to purchase another Mattel product, but they couldn't guarantee when this set would be available again. My son said he wanted his Piston Cup track even though the motor wasn't working.Now it's working and he has the best of both worlds, but I'm very disappointed that Mattel would put out something so badly designed that it breaks in less than a minute. The fix was relatively easy, but be careful with the little washers that go on the gear posts...take the back off very slowly to see where they go."
3,"Girl, Interminable","Girl, Interminable, September 15, 2005Reviewer: A customerThis book is a great tale of life in a psychiatric ward.However, due to its diary format, it has no beginning or end, and certainly no main plot, making it easy to put down and pick up later.I wish the author the best, but I didn't get much information that would be practical for my own life out of her book."
4,"Was very good, wish there had been better selection of matches","I really enjoyed the interviews on disc one. Honestly, that is what carried the whole set. I was disappointed that the selection of matches they selected. I mean, with all the legendary matches they had with superstars, they had the nerve to show Tully, Arn, and Ric, vs. Rocky King, Pez Whatley, and the Italian Stallion! People did not buy this set for those type of matches, I certainly did not. And the War Games from 1988?! The 1987 was the original and THE best! They left out how J.J. Dillon throwed champaign in Sting's face, the feuds with Ronnie and Jimmy Garvin (They showed that date with Precious) Dusty Rhodes beating the crap out of Tully Blanchard with a bat, and Tully and Arn's brief feud with the Midnight Express. again, very good, but the match selection could have been a whole lot better. If this was a Crockett/Turner owned DVD, I am sure we would have gotten the Total Package (no pun intended)"
5,So pretty... So addictive.,"I'm not much of an MMO player, but LOTRO's newbie experience was very user-friendly. The game is gorgeous, the quests are quirky and interesting, and I'm glad I'm playing it."
4,A Bad Movie -Maybe- Worth Seeing...,"Plan 9 From Outer Space is definitely worthy of being considered one of the worst films of all time. In fact, it is so bad that it takes serious commitment to sit through the whole thing! I would say that it is excruciatingly painful (to the mind) to watch this movie. It is horrendous! But that's why we all watch it, isn't it?It is indeed terrible, full of blatantly incorrect ""scientific"" information. It is worth seeing just for the speeches towards the end - completely hysterical!However, I would like to point out that the *documentary* of Plan 9, which is included in this version, is at least as poorly made a film as Plan 9 itself. The documentary is a farce. I turned it off after about three minutes of fast-forwarding.So you've been warned about Plan 9 - see it if you dare!"
1,The Virginian,"I received the book and found that the last few pages were missing. I contacted the seller and was told to returned the book for a refund.I returned the book, received a nasty letter from the seller with no refund. The seller Jo Ann Tonks is not a honerable person."
3,This book makes dolphin operas? a secret review,"Although certainly with the pages are these words, these purpose built spores, likefeilds or kansas. And although again, like a cousin. I read this book and yet somewhere there were people outside the cover, some other story. Perhaps is pehaps is a juice box, what is needed here are vitamins. Such bitter health.Read about art maybe?for more secret reviews visit secrettechnology (add the normal web page bit to the end of that)."
5,great freshwater hobbyist book,This is a great book for hobbyists of all levels. It is filled with detailed information and great pictures.I am really thrilled to own it.
3,Not Bad,The show was pretty funny and he talks about some crazy things. It is not a bad movie but you have to have a certain type of humor to appreciate Dane Cook.
3,zzzzzzzz....,"This book is very very very usefull... as a paperweight. Don't get me wrong, some content was very helpful but this book is definetly not for beginners. its too lengthy and I wished it showed more step by step examples!"
1,Food from China is killing our pets!,"I used to feed these to my dogs with caution knowing that they come from China. The pet food store I bought them from got all the reports from the company about how good they are in quality. But even now the local *good* pet food stores are not carrying them. They don't want the liability of these items potentially harming and killing pets. It's not hard to do your own chicken jerky, or buy USA products. Don't just reduce the amount of these you are giving, just stop giving them. Let's buy from reputable sources. Remember the pet food from China a couple of years ago that was killing pets due to a contaminant?"
2,"Great idea, poor execution!","I really believed that this would solve all my storage and put my DVD collection at my fingertips any time I wanted. I spent hours putting DVD's in the unit, 389 of them with just enough room to store a few more if I wanted, only to find that it wouldn't play a single DVD. It has some kind of feature that looks for copyright infringement of something and I have nothing but top dollar store bought DVD's that wouldn't play. I thought Sony was the top of the line so I purchased this with confidence. Wow, I was so wrong. I called for technical help and after 10 minutes of phone menu runaround, I ended up with a person unable to articulate in english and from Pakistan living in the Phillipines. The concept is fantastic, but they need to work on this to be a viable product. Glad to deal with Amazon and able to get a refund on a product not worthy of working at all. If you buy this unit I wish you all the best in getting it to work."
2,It hasn't worked right since we recieved it,"The DVD has skipped since day 1. Had I not thrown away the slip, I would have sent it back. You can't watch the whole movie. If there's a way I can replace it, please let me know."
3,"There were times that I really liked this book, and then...","I really found myself absorbed in this book for the first couple of hundred pages. I thought about it throughout the day and looked forward to reading it in bed each night. I had some problem with the characters' obsessions with Latin and the odd pagan rituals surrounding the lake, but I was able to suspend disbelief long enough to enjoy the storyline. As the novel continued, though, the plot became more and more problematic, predictable, and just sort of creepy. The novel had great intentions but didn't quite deliver. I would try another book by this author, though, because I did like her writing style, but I can't really say that I recommend this book."
4,A very good tool,This book enabled me to reach new levels for my own abilities and have used it as a reference guide many times. For a beginner it is a valuable tool. It came highly recommend by a mentor of mine and she did not lead me astray.
1,"Leaks, Leaks, Leaks!","This bottle leaks entirely too much! I have to clean out my bottle warmer everytime I used these bottles. Born Free bottles are the best! They are great in preventing colic and gas, plus no leakage."
4,violent = fun,"People are complaining about this movie because it wasn't""thought provoking"". Like so many other people, I enjoy watching films that stimulate my mind, and actually give me some type of knowledge by the end. But everyonce in awhile, I like to watch nothing but pure, simple violence and sex...this movie provided just that. If you haven't seen it yet, and you've read the reviews, you already know the basic plot. See it anyway if you like alot of senseless violence, blood, drug use, demented humor and Julie Delphy nake. This movie is junk food for your head, and everyone likes junk food everyonce in awhile...unless you're a complete tighta$$. Good ACTION movie, it also has a unique soundtrack"
4,Best of both worlds,"Well written, easy to read, and extremely interesting information. This books provide an interesting insight into the other side of our ""reality"".This should be a must read for everyone, if nothing else than to show there is always two sides to every story. In this case, the majority of the population has no idea about the side of the story being detailed in this book.More references and hard evidence would make this 5 stars."
4,Golf Tees/Stocking Stuffer,Gave these as a stocking stuffer for a new golfer in the family. He was very happy to receive them.
5,Slide Sorter Lightbox,Sorter is great for sorting your slides. Helps you to get everything organized if you want to get everything in order of how you took your pictures.
4,Textbook,This book covers a range of topics related to modern families. Both it's content and photos are up-to-date. There may even be a picture of the Obamas on p. 17! The book is easy to read.
4,Play is great. Cover differs from one shown,"I had seen the play in NY and wanted a copy- particularly liked the cover design, and was looking forward to having that as well as the play. The writing does not disappoint. The cover design was NOT as pictured and did disappoint. Would be wary of ordering from this seller again"
3,Magic lost in translation?,"This book has some awesome and brilliant moments, classic moments of heroism and romance but I felt that the flow of the book was disturbed by its translation into english. I sensed the greatness but the prose did not convey it.It's worth a read nonetheless just don't expect to enjoy a reread. Once you're done, you will probably put it down and relive the great moments in your head rather than in the prose itself. This book makes me wish I could read japanese."
3,Does not fit 6-Quart Mixers,This item does not fit the 6-quart mixer. Would be fine for smaller mixers.
1,Didn't Work with Panasonic Cordless Phone,I had recently purchased a Panasonic KX-TGA cordless phone and got this headset for it. People I talked with on the phone said it sounded like I was under water and that the signal was faint. I tried it on my older VTech; same problem.
2,"Not ""All That""","THe thing worked only a short time per attempt before it went off the track or the sprinkler arms blew off from the water pressure. Can't turn up the water pressure above half on without a ""blow out"" occuring. Got tired of fooling with the darn thing and sold it on e-bay. I lost a little money but at least the old-fashined oscillating sprinker worked and worked very well. I would not recommend this sprinkler to anyone."
1,I hated this book,"Dalma Heyn tries to make a case for women asserting themselves against patriarchy by having affairs. What she forgets, or ignores, is what these women do TO OTHER WOMEN when they engage in affairs with married men. As a betrayed wife I know the pain of seeing another woman aid and abet my husband's deception and betrayal of our marriage.What kind of feminism is it that takes its power from ruining the lives of women and often children who have no choice in the matter and often don't know what is going on until it is all too late? Dalma Heyn sets women against each other, applauding the women who take what they want and ignoring the plight of the women who suffer for this. I hated this book, and I'll bet anything my husband's mistress read it and felt justified by it."
3,fly shocks disappointing,"I purchased a Timberline-4 15 years ago and it is still working fine. However, I bought a second one 2 years ago and what a difference in quality. the shock cords on fly are fine on the old tent but already frayed and ruined on the new tent. The quality of this tent has definitely fallen."
3,"Boring, but with a touching ending.","This book starts off boring, with long spaces between the battles. I only read about a third of the first 200 pages. Once the battle starts, however, you gain insight to the generals' thoughts. You learn that they have feelings, and experience emotion quite often. Some people think that grown men do not struggle with the deaths of their friends, or that they are uninterested in others' lives. This staement is proven wrong with the raw emotion present in this book. This book is more about the pain and jubilation when losing of winning a battle, not the historican aspects. This book is a great read, but not unless you have to or really want to readit. I wouldn't recomend it for children or most young adults."
3,Fun for kids,"The third and hofpefully last in the seris, was about redemption, and friendship. Both good things for young kids to learn but the storylines were confusted and somewhat convoluted."
5,Still holds up...,Great book and subject matter that is still so applicable today. It si a quick read but really gets your brain working. I could read this over and over. Right up there with To Kill a Mockingbird in my opinion as far as classics go.
5,"If Drexel Burnham or high yield bonds interest you, this is a must read.","I have always found the the wave leveraged buyouts in the 1980s fascinating. Stewart does an excellent job of illustrating the key players in the high yield debt market during that period, particularly its chief architect Michael Milken and his firm Drexel Burnham."
1,Didn't work and company would not give refund!,"When I received the item it looked brand new so I figured that it must work. However, after installing the software and trying to use it, I could not get wireless on my laptop no matter what I did. When I buy a product, the product itself is just as important as the customer service and the company I buy it from. This company asked me to return the item with a tracking number. I paid to reship it to them when they were the ones who sent me a faulty product and I still have not heard from them nor gotten a refund! Furthermore, I am disappointed in Amazon because I have contacted them to resolve this matter and they have also ignored my request for help. This whole endeavor was a disappointment and I still do not have wireless on my laptop and now I have wasted money on shipping the product to me, shipping it back to them, and I have no product but I paid the company. How ridiculous!"
3,Lewis Corey 1930,"How much of this ""The House of Morgan"" is really from Lewis Corey's The House of Morgan (1930)? Corey's work was brilliant."
5,JUST A GREAT READ!!,"Right from the first story, about a nuclear holocaust, the book catches you..we see a pretty realistic view of what would happen thru the eyes of a superhero. COnsidering I was expecting all fun, this was totally out of left field and very interesting. NO happy ending in this story-everybody just dies. Wow! Otherwise, very imaginative and fun stories all the way thru. I love this stuff and these were chosen well. Im not huge on Jimmy Olsen but this is a very fun story..Also the kids of superman story has a very interesting psychological element adding some actual depth/richness to the characters in the story. Overrall, a great compilation much more varied than you'd expect.So lighten up from deep angst, gritty violence and huge veiny muscles (and tiny heads)of the current stories. Consider whimsy.."
2,Just nothing,"First of all, this book goes so many times out of the main story that is difficult to remember it, the main story could be written in 50 pages or less, you won't take anything of this book, maybe two or three things about the animals Down Under but that is all. The story doesn't have any sense since the first page till the last one."
3,Usable,"It is easy to use and enter stamps, Documentation is lacking and only helps for setup and to get you started entering stamps. There is a lot more you can do with this software. By trial and error I have been able to add more info on the stamps and its release history. There are many reports you can choose from, or create a report of your own, but no instructions on how to do so. I feel someone who knows Microsoft Access will not have any problems creating any report. My software never updated last year at all even though it would search for updates, it would look for the 2011 version and not the 2012 version."
3,What's the difference between this and Classic Queen/Greatest Hits?,I'll tell you. 12 songs (six on each set). So it comes down to what you like. I'll take these six songs from Classic Queen:1. Stone Cold Crazy2. One Year of Love3. Tie Your Mother Down4. These are the Days of Our Lives5. Keep Yourself Alive6. Body Languageover these six songs from Greatest Hits I and II any day of the week:1. Flash2. Innuendo3. It's a Hard Life4. Breakthru5. The Invisible Man6. Friends Will be FriendsAny questions?
4,Reflections on the Art of Living...,A good summary of the things everyone should know. Enough said. You'll enjoy the summary of guidelines for happier and better living.
5,One of my favorites,"Big & Rich, like Toby Keith, have that great country rock sound along with a great sense of humor. Great album"
4,Nice watch great price,I wanted an analog perpetual calendar watch and this one fit the bill nicely. Great price!!
3,Meh. I like MAC better.,"I like a lot of theBalm's stuff but wasn't overly impressed with this. Like another reviewer, I thought it made my wrinkles more noticeable and heaven knows I don't need that. I'll use it as an eyeshadow base so not a complete waste of money."
1,sucks,this is cd is the worse thing i have ever heard do not waste your money on this. i would much rather burn a 20 dollar bill then use it to buy this cd.
4,Step Reebok Circuit Challenge DVD,"I was happy to be able to find this DVD. The sound is slightly off, but it is very usable to work out with."
2,Obviously none of the other people commenting here are professionals,"This clipper is a big eh. It's not a ""fast feed"" at all. You have to go over the hair that you are clipping again and again, and you still risk uneven work. Anyone who loves this clipper doesn't cut hair for a living. This is the sort of a clipper that comes with a beauty school starter kit. If you want super quality, you gotta pull out the Oster big wig, the awesome classic 76!!"
5,"Multi-Layered, Spare, Beautiful","Million Dollar Baby seems like a simple story on the surface. It is told sparely, without ruffles or flourishes, but like all great art, has layers of meaning and symbolism.On the surface (and what a vivid surface!) there is the boxing, and Maggie's indomitable spirit, which all her life has helped her fight to survive.There are the relationships, laconic but deep, like slow-flowing rivers; the bones on which the surface lies.And at the movie's heart: there is religious significance. The story becomes one of Christ's parables of the Good Samaritan or the Kingdom of Heaven. And there is a Christ figure. But who is the Christ figure and how can that person save others?It is interesting that some conservative groups find this movie offensive. If they consider it anti-family or anti-religious, they are really missing the point."
2,Not junk food,"Ok, I love mac&cheese in the blue box. This one is not at all like that. I'm thinking it is because it has less saltiness. Not cheesy enough for me but its handy for lunch."
2,Cannot be zero'd,This arrived today and I quickly discovered its obvious design flaw. All well and good that it will calculate your distance etc over a 7 day period but its laughable that the read-out cannot be completely zero'd unless you do a complete system reset resulting in having to input the time and all your personal information again. The lack of this flexibility is a very short-sighted decision by the manufacturer.
5,Heavy M4 M16 Replica Airsoft Gun Double Eagle M83 A2 Full Automatic Electric Rifle,"First airsoft I own. My kids and I love it. For the price you can't expect much more. It works great, no issues, those little balls will leave a welt on bare skin from about 12ft. We plink indoors on small objects and its lots of fun. I was thinking of buying a real AR-15 but then it's too much of a hassle to go to the range, come home and clean. This is easier."
5,travel,"For a trip to Australia, this is an excellent guide. It lists all places of interest, hotels and restaurants. discusses money and special events. Photographs are also excellent. I would recommend this"
3,Demasiado básico,"Si buscas un libro donde aparezcan los conceptos más básicos del ballet, este es perfecto.El problema es que abarca muchos temas y profundiza poco en todos."
1,"western chief men's 16"" knee boot",I ordeded this boot in a size 14. the plastic packaging the boots came in stated a size 14 on a sticker and a size 10 printed on the plastic. The attached tag on the boot stated a size 14 but on the bottom of the boot was stamped size 10. Turns out the boots were a size 10 (too small) and had to be returned.
1,Does not work for art of shaving trial kit brush!,"Call me naive, but I thought this stand would work with the brush that comes in the Art of Shaving trial kit. Why stock the kit with a smaller brush? Smaller bottles with less product? Yes. Smaller brush? Without stating so? While suggesting that you buy their stand?NO.So, it is decent quality for plastic and $11, but make sure you have the standard sized brush (which they do not define, and is not stated in the product description). Good luck!"
5,Fast Delivery,I was very pleased with the quickness of delivery. The book arrived a couple days after I place the order. It was in good condition as described on line.
3,The Right Stuff..,I really enjoyed this movie. It was cool to see movie stars when they were young...
3,The Shiz,Not what I was expecting. I read the whole book and didn't really like the story too much. I guess I just wanted more from the characters.
3,Periodontal Surgery: A Clinical Atlas,"The volume arrived in perfect condition. The large and well-spaced format promised clear illustration and sequencing of procedures, which was mostly,but not always, the case. A number of procedures had quite complex suturing involved, which was only shown when completed, not during the suturing, and this I found quite a let down.Overall, the Atlas describes, with the aid of great photographs, a variety of periodontal surgical procedures, but does not always provide the desired detail in all aspects of the procedure."
5,Nice deal.,I actually just bought these just to have some new ones around when the time comes. I currently use an electric toothbrush but it's too soft so I guess I will go with these once the brush is worn down on the electric tooth-brush.
3,Pointy Boobs and Itchy Fabric,Pointy boobs and somewhat itchy fabric. That's what you'll get. The lining of the bra is also a bit oddly done and strangely cut at the back. Good support though. And worth it for under $10 if you are mainly looking for an inexpensive bra that functions properly.
2,Wireless ... when it works,"We have had these 2 or three weeks. We bought two at once so I could play with my son. Both of them are on the blink. The biggest issues is the joy stick controller. When new, the joy stick will produce movement in eight positions. One of them is down to producing movement in only 6 directions. No fun! They eat batteries. Maybe every 12 hrs of play. Somestimes, without warning, your character will start moving with the joystick in the neutral position. The only way to fix it is to take the batteries out. We have two units. Sometimes, one controler will move two characters. We are going to give wavebird a try."
3,Excellent Dentist Office Addition,"I like the Atlantic, but I confess I do not like it enough so that I will continue to subscribe. I read it while awaiting treatment at my dentist's office, while on the train or at a coffee shop. In 45 minutes, I have had my fill. It is otherwise not compelling in its originality or capacity.The articles are better than most popular magazines. I enjoy Mark Steyn and Mark Bowden, but get tired of Christopher Hitchens' proselytory writing tone.Occasional issues have been dumbed down, are feel as if they are being geared for the Entertainment Tonight crowd.The Atlantic is a good read in short spurts, but inconsistent over the entire issue, I now only buy a couple issues a year, at most.Anthony Trendlhttp://anthonytrendl.blogspot.com"
2,DMX/Ruff Ryders worst album ever!!!,"I was really disapointed at this album, most of the beats is the worst I ever heard... The beats makes NO LIMIT's early producers sounds like GODS!U will be greatly dissapointed, buy IT's DARK AND HELL IS HOT instead it's DMX's greatest, they could have easily removed 6 wack songs from this album and made it an EP instead"
1,Quality issues,"This thing is a piece of junk.When it works, it's great. But ours started leaking recently... as others have said, for a machine at this price range, one would expect longer life and better quality.Stay away from the product, it's junk!Customer service was horrible as well...."
1,Not up to the task,"Initially, I was pleased with this tv stand. I purchased the large size to accomodate a 32 inch TV. After about a week, the swivel shelf appeared to be sagging slightly under the weight of the TV. At first I thought that this was an optical illusion, but the sag has become more pronounced. Currently, it sags about an inch and the turntable is becoming difficult to swivel. I intend to shore up the swivel shelf with a support, but this really should not be necessary for a product in this price range. This is the second time in the past two years or so that I have been disappointed by the quality of a product from this vender. It's a shame because they used to make some really nice, sturdy furniture."
5,"A pleased reader from Cambridge, MA","Tabs, flaps, surprises and a scary owl are part of the fun of this well-conceived book. The pop-up engineering is really amazing and the illustrations are scientifically accurate as well as beautiful. Children love finding the hidden animals and there is so much variety and excitement in these 12 pages, that it will be enjoyed as much by adults as by children. It is a wonderful book for a parent or grandparent to share with the young ones."
5,Amazing country,"I have to say this is different than some of his older material, but this in no way lessens it. My two favorite tracks are ""Good imitation of the blues"" which is definitely NOT a twangy country song, but honest and I felt it deeply. The other one is the Firefly's Song, which blew me away. I really recommend this cd to anyone - even people who generally don't go wild about country music. You won't regret it."
3,Helpful,There was a problem with my order and they fixed it promptly. Very easy to work with and willing to help you out.Thanks!
1,My prediction came true...,"Back when Eminem came out I made a prediction. After he made his fortune, after he ranted and complained about his supposed hardship, after he plagiarized real music to the point of not having any more good material... that he would end up tanking. Because we all now know that he never had any talent to begin with, as with most rap ""artists"". This genre of music is on its death bed and people like Eminem are assuring its demise (Thank God)."
3,Be sure to measure,"It's a beautiful lamp, but I neglected to note how small it is. It's really not big enough to go on a side table where you will be reading. It's a nice accent light, tbough. Pretty pricey for the size. The company was cooperative in cancelling the 2nd one before they shipped it."
2,"Asprey's ""Rise"" Left Me Flat","First off, let me say that I am not an avid reader of biographies. But when a compelling, beautifully written biography like Edmund Morris's ""The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt"" or Antonia Fraser's ""Marie Antoniette"" comes along, I devour it happily. I did not find Robert Asprey's ""The Rise of Napoleon"" to be that kind of book at all. This is a military history, first and foremost. If you want to know (and can keep track of) every move of every division of every army in which Napoleon ever fought, or fought against, this book is for you. I wanted much more personal information, much more about the inner thoughts of the man and what might have made him tick. Nor does Asprey do much towards explaining the world in which Napoleon lived or the political forces that made him what he became. Honestly, I couldn't finish this first volume, and will certainly not go on to read the second."
4,Satisfied,"I ordered this product mostly because the price was a shocking $0.01. I thought it was a mistake, but bought it anyway. The adapter arrived within a few days and worked perfectly. I'm quite pleased."
1,Watch picture is deceiving,"I bought this watch because it appeared there was silver running down the middle of the leather band. When received, there is no silver or line down the middle of the band, it is where the two leather pieces come together. I was very disappointed as it clearly looks like a silver piece. Have to be careful with misleading advertising!"
5,Five Stars,"Every time I listen to this album it gets me excited. It's one of my favorite blues records because it never gets dull. It really deserves five stars. The horn section is great and Mr. Rush's performance speaks for itself. Also for fans of Duane Allman, it's interesting to listen to him play rhythym guitar on this one. A great pick."
1,UghhhUghhhhUghhhhh SO BORING and not REAL Pro Wrestling,NO COMMENTS. That tape should deserve below 0 stars.Believe me don't waste your money at all.Look for ECW and FMW DVD's much better.
3,Ok for a beginner,"This product while great for a child will never be useful for someone who knows what they are doing with a microscope. For the money I think you can get a better product, but it is adequate."
1,Don't bother,This is as bad a book as I have try to read in a long time. I would have to see to believe the good review it suppose to have from The L A Times.Reader in California
5,The Patriot,"A terrific piece of cold war lore which discets the acute parinoria peddled ""anti communist"" hucksters their own ends. Set on the eve of the Vietnam war it served up a stern warning that must never be ignored. A fabulous period piece by an almost unknown author that is as mesningful today as it was 45+ years ago. I'm only surprised it was never made into a movie."
4,it does the job,I send this product for my aunt in germany. It does the job but I believe its a little too pricy for the small amount of make up.
3,Not that great,"Not the best cartridge to get. The sound isn't that clear and crisp & the first one I got I had to take back because it simply didn't work out of one channel. Best advice - listen to the audiophile's warning. This really was made to be played at a loud venue where the intricacies and details of the tune's/sounds aren't being concentrated on, and this is a good stylus to scratch if you're into it.Stanton's got some better ones out there and the Shure 44's are pretty solid. Comparable to this, IMO, are a few of the NuMarks but I'd actually rate them a cut above. And if you're into the good sound, check out some of the Grado's. Regardless, you're not gonna get a primo sounding cartridge on the cheap so sometimes with these you get what you pay for in terms of sound quality. For beginners, maybe check this out. Audiophiles looking to enjoy a good album may be disappointed.This one doesn't come with a headshell, etc. so you're on your own there. Just got the screws, etc."
2,Of some use for the beginner,I bought this book in the hope for movement instructions like in Yang's excellent Qigong books where arrows were added to the photographs. To keep it short I don't see the beneficial effect of avoiding 'confusing' descriptions of movements and therefore the actual link between the positions depicted in the photographs. This book is still of some use to me but only after I grasped the basic movements in a training (luckily with a Chen family member). Once these basic ideas of the various positions are somewhat clearer the book helps to recollect the steps one might not be sure of.Anyway if you plan to train with a master more then 3 times a week you will simply not have much use for the book.
4,glamour life stuff,nice new formals. beats those ugly ones you got with the original sims2!now if we only got to pick our shoes and jewelry...
5,Worth the money.,"This was a Christmas gift. The kiddo loves it and it seems to be holding up to her abuse. It's got some good speed to it, but not too much that you'll be making a trip to the nearest emergency room. It only took her a couple of tries to get good at it (and she is a bit clumsy). I think this would be the kind of thing any kid would love (and smaller adults)."
1,Save your time and effort,... It was so out of alinement and out of plane that any amount of tuning couldn't salvage it...
3,"Serviceable, with a flaw","I needed a 10"" knife holder to fit on the side of an upper cabinet in the kitchen, and this one was the only 10"" I found on Amazon, so I gave it a try. It is as others have described--the magnetic strips don't lay flat, and in fact are skewed in three dimensions! It was a bit disheartening to see, considering its high price in relation to longer, nicer-looking holders out there. But it's a utilitarian object to me--so although the magnets don't contact the blades perfectly, they do well enough to hold my large Henckels chef's knives with no problem. My slicer and boning knives don't seem to hold as well, but the steel is different and there's just less metal to contact the magnets; they don't feel like they're going to fall off when tested. All in all, the holder suits my needs okay and I'd probably buy it again--I just wish it was made to better tolerances."
3,Collected best works stands as what it is,"If you like Charlie's music but don't want to buy all his albums to get the best songs then this is a good choice, gave a copy to my Brother in law and he seems to love it. I got it for Rolling with the flow and was quite satisfied with my purchase."
4,Vallejo Fan,I am a fan of Mr. Vallejo and really enjoy the calendars. In fact I usually buy one for myself and one for my brother-in law.
3,A text that's streighforward but dated and unexciting,"I had this book for First Year Russian. It's probably not the best book for beginning Russian. It's somewhat old with no pictures, games, cultural information, or the other types of things you might find in a modern textbook. However, it did the trick and helped to propel me into what would eventually become my major in college."
2,Not very funny,"I had to review this book because I am a big fan of Tom Robbins. What?, you ask, this isn't a Robbins book. The good folks at Amazon lump these books together(other people who bought this bought...); however, Pest Control is no Jitterbug Perfume. If you are looking for another author with his panache, style, and spirit, you will find none of these things in Pest Control. Now, the premise of P.C. is a decently amusing one, and the possibilities exist for hilarity. Upon delving into the book, I found the subject to be the only funny aspect. The characters are unbelievable, and the situations impossible. By contrast, I believe that all of Tom Robbins fantasies could indeed be reality. Let there be immortality, boundless sexual energy, and tons of kinky, inspired, enlightened people all over the universe. If you love Tom Robbins, spare yourself Pest Control."
2,Get Your Green Thumb Ready,"I used this company because it had such good reviews, but though my tree game full of dark green leaves they quickly started to fall off. As I took the tree out of the box I noticed a significant amount of leaf-loss, but it was so full of leaves I figured this was normal. Over the next week about 75% of the leaves fell off despite proper watering, humidity, and sun. The company sent me a replacement tree which arrived all but dead. I now believe that both trees experienced shock being transported in the cold weather. I was able to save the first tree they sent me but I would advise agains ordering in the cold weather months or paying for expedited shipping."
2,Don't bother,"I received this watch as a gift some years back and was almost instantly disappointed with it. A week into ownership the movement froze and ceased functioning after a long walk in the snow. Later, the whole crown came out completely. The watch was replaced under warrantee (but it took nearly three months to receive a new one), but a year or so later it happened again when the watch was out of warrantee.Ultimately, I was really disappointed by the workmanship of this product. There are certainly much better watches out there for the price."
4,Relaxed!,"I tried this DVD for the first time today (since it took Amazon more than 5 days to ship it to me). I've done yoga before so this DVD was not very difficult but it did make me sweat. I like that the dvd has litle segments (10-15 minutes each) that you can pick from - good breathing, meditation, circulation, balancing, or relaxation techniques. I have some balancing issues from my immune system attacking parts of my brain two months ago. I was able to do the segments without losing balance and I felt better afterwards. My kids(ages 9 & 13)even did the dvd with me without my asking them to do it. I felt relaxed after doing the dvd. I like the segments because you can do all of them if you have time or pick and choose on other days when you don't have time. Ok - this is really superficial but I didn't rate it a 5 star because of the way the instructor was dressed and at some parts I couldn't hear her because the music was louder than her voice."
4,Good condition and fast shipping,"The book was in good condition, the only problem is that it's binded and this was not mentioned in the product description"
3,Interesting,"We are using this book for a Sunday evening study. So far, it has been a great discussion tool for our group."
2,Fat ugly crocs,"This was my first pair of crocs, planned to use them for gardening and expected to find them very comfortable as per reviews and friends' opinions. There are very wide - the box said roomy fit or some similar word. They are supposed to be M but are quite wide and I have narrow feet, so my feet slip around in them, they are bulky and with the red, I look ridiculous in them but do wear them in the muddy garden when watering etc. Disappointed in the fit."
4,Enriching and enjoyable,"I do not want to pretend to be a snobbish, elitist scholar. I really like Jack, and maybe I feel charitable toward him in his faults. But I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and it probably helped me to know that this was his earliest post conversion work. It drew me in, fascinated me, I could relate to a lot of it as I came down similar roads, and it taught me things I didn't know while bringing into clearer focus things I did. Also, I read many of his other works before reading this, and I have also read several of his favorite authors and works, so I sort of knew where he was coming from. I would recommend this book to any reader though- only please do read Surprised by Joy at some point if you haven't yet. There is a richness in The Pilgim's Regress. Don't miss it!"
2,Could have been so much better....,"I was so disappointed. Too many characters, big print, no resolution, just...disappointing. Good thing she is on to another series, but this one deserved better."
2,No reason to read this,"Overwhelming mediocre, there is literally no reason to read this book. It is not ""bad"" per se, but there is not a single redeeming quality in the story's plot, dialogue or characters.Sorcha is stunningly angelic and one dimensional,and she never wavers in her task. More than half of this book is romance, rather than fantasy, and is misleadingly classified. Mariller fumbles through cliches as her eventual lovers cannot communicate their feelings, and Sorcha's brothers all fit obvious archetypes.There is nothing new here, and nothing done exceptionally well, and as such, you would be better off reading something else."
3,Has A Sound All It's Own.,"I've had this CD for a handful of years. I've never listened to it very much, but there's no doubt that Big Country sounded like nobody but themselves. This album was released when New Wave was very popular, but The Crossing doesn't follow that formula. Their use of guitars and how they sound is very different and interesting. I've never been a fan of Big Country really, but I do think ""In a Big Country"" and ""Chance"" are good songs. The rest of the songs are pretty good. This isn't a bad release."
1,Where is Tom Wolfe when you need him?,"The writing in the two other customer reviews is far better, livelier and to the point than the author's. And hopefully, Kuh's reporting is more reliable than his L.A. restaurant reviews. Kuh initially whines that he couldn't make his story come alive: he was so right. His own (apparently unedited) irrelevant personal feelings, mixed into the tale, made this important story convoluted and almost unreadable.... a shame since he took up the time of so many illustrious people during his extensive research and also seemed to initially pinpoint important social themes. Where is Tom Wolfe when you need him? Keep your knives, Patric. And your day job."

4,DVD WARNING,"I concur with others about the quality of the film. Serious, insightful, wonderfully acted, one of the best screenplays to ever come out of Hollywood. However, the DVD is abysmal. The video is grainy and indistinguishable from average VHS quality. The worst, however, is the ""Widescreen"" presentation. To achieve the effect, Warners video actually cuts off some of the upper and lower part of the screen. This, of course, defeats the whole purpose of widescreen. This is not the first DVD I've seen this on, and it's a disgrace: consumer fraud of the highest degree."
3,not as good as the book,I just read the book also; the film is a watered-down version of the book without the 19th-century style. The book is creepy and suspenseful -- that gets lost in the film. (Probably if it were a close adaptation of the book it would be too long.)
3,Seems small but it isn't,"This bag is one of the favorites from those I already own(because is smallish but looks cool hehe), the reason I bought it was to carry my netbook and some college books/notebooks.So now the pros:-Good built quality for it's price-Roomier for a 12"" inch bagThe cons:-has no handle-the strap is way too thin, which make feel anything you're carrying more heavy-the compartment for pencils and stuff is too smallShould you buy this? Only if you'll carry light weight stuff, a netbook, couple of books or so."
1,Not for the petite woman,"I purchased this carrier and found that once I returned to my pre-baby size it didn't fit. I am 5ft and have a slight build. I am not able to pull the straps tight enough to feel that my son is secure. I am now on my third carrier and it seems to fit perfectly (The Ergo carrier original works, Red Castle Sport is also too big). If you want to purchase this make sure you try it on and put a real baby into it."
5,To Our Children's Children's Children,"The release of the Moody Blues (Edge,Pender,Thomas,Lodge and Hayward) of this album was like an extention of all of their work from Days of Future Past to that point.The album has more of a theme to it then the others and the joint efforts of all members makes it timeless piece.Let yourself go and listen to the album, you'll find songs running through you head all day long.Truly Moody Blues signature work!"
1,Less Than Stellar Set,"Not only did they put a Cinemascope film in a ""Full Frame"" dvd, but again, they put 3 movies together that should be sold separately (for those who disliked the second and third movies like me) or in a collector's box set. Sandra Dee was the best, and in my opinion, the only Gidget. The second and third movies were just horrible! Yes they have James Darren back as Moondoggie, but why not bring back Sandra Dee if they were going to make sequels? Save your money, this set is not worth buying.If you want to see Gidget in all its original beauty and not hacked to pieces like on this dvd set, tune into TCM they play it occasionally."
3,There are 2 Wildside editions,"For a scholarly edition with all the notes by Theodore Alois Buckley, see Wildside's other edition, ISBN 978-1-4344-6138-4 (The Odyssey of Homer, translated by Alexander Pope.) This edition is meant for casual reading."
4,Exceptional Film,"The life of Edith Piaf unfolds from the depths of poverty to ove of the most beloved and famous singers the world hs ever known. The film does so with superb production values, wonderful performances and especially the fearless and spot on portryal by Marion Cotilard as Edith.She owns the film - and the performance is nothing short of spectacular."
1,An enormous disappointment!,Not worth a lengthy review. Please bring back Alex Cross as soon as possible.
2,Don't like,"Too boring, black and white sketches are hard to follow. I prefer the yogiboom ones. They are much more concise and easy to follow."
5,Wow. This show rocks.,"This is Black Sabbath from 1978, right before Ozzy was to leave for good. The video is superb quality for that year. I get pissed at people who compare this to something that was released a year ago. For cryin out loud, this thing is 25 years old! It's not gonna have widescreen! Anyway, the thing is recorded at a very low volume, so if you want to headbang you'll have to crank your amp.This DVD serves as a blueprint for how they should have done Last Supper. There are no interviews, no cutting away from the show. Just a straight up live concert with no commentary. Maybe they'll get it straight next time!"
4,A good message on reality!,"While the acting may be bad, they made sure the core message about the streets got out in this one. What you do in your youth and as a young adult can easily come back to haunt you - even if you left the gang life behind, enemies don't forget your face! ""Smile now, Cry later"""
4,Bambi II,I have not wtached this movie yet I basically bought it for the neices and nephews for Christmas. I am saving it to go in their stockings.
3,"Some classic moments, but overall a bit dull","I remember really enjoying this film aas a young child. Funnily enough only for the scenes which I consider now ""classic moments"". These include James Garner driving into the pool, the soap suds in the back yard, and DOris Day's first day on the job as the Soap model.However, the overall film is quite dull and I can see why it is not one of Doris's most famous films. When people think of a Doris film, they think of ""Pillow Talk"". It's rare to find folks that remember this movie.It's nice to see the film again after all the years, but it did drag ..."
1,Horrible waste of money!,"What a horrible waste of money these are, they are too small even the largest of the largest are too small, they don't stay on, they don't hold any liquidy material, the stuff gets all over the dog, the carpet, the house and you just blew away $15 buckos for absolutely nothing!"
5,Detective Novel That Hits a Homer,"""Squeeze"" is about baseball, or at least crimes connected to a fictitious minor league team and its star player, but even NON-baseball fans who love a good mystery and great dialogue will enjoy this first novel by Steven Pipe. Reminds me a bit of of Stuart Kaminsky's Toby Peters detective stories, although this one is set in the present time. I hope there is a sequel in the works!"
3,It could be magic...if it tried a little harder...,"This spinoff series to Bewitched, one of the greatest sitcoms of all times, tries very hard to capture the magic of the original but just misses. It's cute in it's own way and fun to hear the soundeffects from the original series reused as well as some of the characters such as Dr. Bombay (played again by Bernard Fox) and the Kravitzes (played again by Sandra Gould and George Tobias). And who can deny how cute Lisa Hartman as Tabitha is.The problem though is that the characters don't seem to be fleshed out until the last couple episodes but by then it was too late. And the fact that this show started in 1977 only five years after Bewitched ended makes you wonder how Tabitha grew up so fast.The video and sound on this DVD release is awesome! Crystal clear and vibrant!If you're looking for some light fun you should check this out."
1,"Too ""out there""",The book presents some weird techniques to get someone to fall in love with you. It has to do with touching people in certain ways to trigger emotions.Her theory is that the touch brings about a positive so eventually the other person will relate you with the positive emotions. A little too out there for my tastes.
1,meditation,there are much better books on meditation than this one.i hope newcomers to meditating won't be discouraged if this is the book they choose.longtimers won't find it to be much help either.(imho)
5,Marching Band,"If you have ever been in a black marching band . . . better yet, if you have ever went to a black high school or college where the kids went to the game, not to see the game, but to watch the band at half time, then you need to rent this DVD. It is tight! It reminded me so much of the life I used to know in the band: challenge, initiation, seniors going crazy with their power-tripping, the difference between chorus style marching (white bands) and military style marching (black bands)! It's all there. There are two more pluses. (1) There's a nice little romance going on. (2) J. Anthony Brown from the Tom Joyner Radio show is in the movie as the band director from the ""bad"" rival band and HE IS A TRIIIPPP!!! He is funny as hell and he reminds me of real band directors who used to shake their booties at the other band when they direct. This is a tight DVD!!! Buy it today. It is so real."
1,cringeworthy and creepy,"i saw this movie as a child decades ago and remember it as bizarre and tedious. i thought to give it another shot since my 6year old loves daddy warbucks in annie. well his much younger self has an afro, wears clownclothes, and has clockwork orange facepaint. the other very amateurish characters declaim and act out buffoonishly and i just felt embarrassed for them. the musical numbers are the only watchable parts of the movie so maybe 15 minutes of mediocre entertainment out of the lot. i don't understand how it got so many good reviews, it is horrible."
4,Good workout,"I've owned this for about two weeks, and have used it several times already. Assembly took about 20 minutes and was very easy. In the two weeks I've had this, I agree that using it is noisy, but I believe it is due to the tread on my mountain bike tire. I'm going to try switching to a smoother road tread to see if the noise decreases. Either way, I'm very happy to have bought this as I've already lost weight and am able to ride for a longer time at a higher speed than I was with the first few uses.I recommend buying a block for the front wheel, too. Not for balance, but to level the height of the front wheel with that of the back wheel."
4,Great Product,"Does what it says: easy to install & scan that stack of cards. Recognition isn't perfect, but very good, and it's easy to edit."
4,My first Hip album ever...,"Music @ Work was my first TTH album ever, and remains one of my favorites. The band has come a long way from this style of music with the recent release of 'In Between Evolution' and the difference is quite stark. The days of 'Music @ Work' seemed to have been simpler times, with simpler, more 'popular' tunes and solid, stick-with-you songs. ""The Completists"", ""Tiger the Lion"", and ""Sharks"" sit high on my favorite Hip songs list. A definite must-have for your Hip listening pleasure. There is just something about song lyrics that actually mean something..."
3,Helpful if you can commit to it.,I had couldn't remember to read the next day's chapter. Especially during the weekends. I ended up putting it down. But it had some sound advice.
5,Great information whether you plan to purchase a bandsaw or you already have one,"This is a very well written publication with relevant information and clear illustrations from an experienced woodworker. Helps you determine how to choose the bandsaw for your needs. Also covers multiple other aspects including use, maintenance, blade selection etc. It was definitely worth the money."
3,Mamodo Battles,"Ever since Zatch Bell went off of Toonami I still watch it to this day, it's a great anime (though the slightly more mature version ""Konjiki no Gash Bell!!"" is far superior)However I expected a fun game but all this is is a repetitive mess.It's entertaining for a while but after you unlock everything (which I've done) it gets boring.Only for Zatch Bell fans really."
5,"Works well, does everything I wanted",I took a long time to select the proper dehydrator for me. I really like this and it works well.
3,20 x loop,They did not state the size or how large was the product. It turned out to be smaller than my other similar products. It was not the size I expected.Ed
1,a license for abuse should not be tolerated,"child abuse is already too prevalent in todays' society, we do not need any more episodes or anyone advocating and giving license to such dreadful acts."
5,Fine product and service,I have other DVDs of the Dog Whisperer. Wonderful learning tool for dogs and people. The service I received from your representatives was great. Obviously your company is doing everything right.Trish Newberry
4,VERY NICE!,I've never not liked Drew. Cute story that most can relate to with the high school experiences and has a great surprise ending.
3,Not all it is cracked up to be,"I bought this book, knowing it was an award winning book, but was very disappointed. The vocabulary is clumsy, as is the language. It also is a bit strange, and not terribly captivating for my 2 1/2 yr old daughter. The pictures are lovely though...."
3,The Chillout Sessions Series is Slipping.,"Chillout Sessions 7 was OUTSTANDING. Unfortunately, Chillout Sessions 8 and 9 are very mediocre at best. I just purchased Chillout Sessions 10, I hope it is better than 8 and 9...I own every chill and lounge CD, for the most part... I'm really dissaponted in this series anymore."
4,A life time lapse,"This is about, just about every frame being, a work of art of two humans, in every variant perspective, powering around to the point of death (and death), in three days. A super condensed version of what we all face. Like a cool time lapse of two lives. Seeing, first hand, a life journey, in 103 minutes. We're all dying, right now. But it's gorgeous as we pass through."
5,My boys have a ball watching these with me,"If you can't be 8 years old anymore(and I don't think I would want to be), then this set along with others out there can let you be for a little while. I grew up watching these whacked out monsters play their music and tell corny jokes . This set of the series was great fun to watch again, and the side benefit is my young boys have fallen in love with the gang of ghouls from ""Horrible Hall"" just like I did all those years ago.One extra for you older fans is that the humor does have an adult edge that is lost on children and makes it fun for us."
5,Super,"Totally awesome. Totally awesome totally awesome totally awesome today is Monday, this is stupid 6 more words left. Almost there..."
4,Good read by the former head of MI5.,"This is a well told story of a hunt for two young, intelligent terrorists, one home grown, by agents from the British MI5 & Mi6, as well as other law enforcement agencies. It provides some genuine insight into the making and motivation of such persons, the hunted and the hunters; and it set forth what seemed to this reader a quite realistic scenario."
4,"A delightful, meditative CD","This CD, the second the Adagio Trio has produced, is a delight to listen to. The pieces are arranged very well, the trio is well balanced, and the recording has a nice depth to it. The performances are quite good, reflecting the quality of each of the trio. The pieces are meditative, but not heavy or dark. They prompt a sense of relaxation and reflection, almost a sense of awe for the universe we live in, and the One who created it. It is a CD that, with their first one called ""Stillpoint"", has found a permanent spot in my CD player."
4,Great creepy fun!,"Thos one took me by surprise. I was expecting your standard currently-trendy capture/torture film, but this was so much better. The villians are truly creepy, thes sets perfect 60's Psycho kitsch, and the perfomances are fine. Actually, we were often on the edge of our seats with this one. A good creepy ride!"
1,Not reliable,"My first one didn't work, they sent me a 2nd one, it worked once. I got a 3rd one and it was a remanufactured one and looked it was poorly assembled. I gave up and went back to traps. Too bad, this is a good idea. I used all the tips they gave me to no avail."
1,"This book is not a ""how-to""","Well, I just got this book. From the Preface: ""This book is not a ""how-to"". This book is one level higher and deals with the cognitive psychological theory of designing and developing technical communication..."". Thats not what I need. I looked for ""how to' not for another academic book. Well this book is going to the return center."
5,Let's get physical Daphne,"Let me start by saying the review written under kelbon,s name is not true. I enjoy listening to this soundtrack very much my favorite song on it is ""Be with you"" by Carmen Rasmusen. I enjoy all the other songs as well."
5,Folding Chess set.,"Loved it. I almost didn't order it because there were some negative reviews. Okay, others say the elastics inside won't hold the chess pieces - who would use those anyway? The box was great, and the pieces, though not weighted, make this wooden chess set worth every penny. Nice going, Amazon."
2,Somewhat greasy and mild tasting,"The taste was somewhat greasy. Hoped for a product better than ""Slim Jims"" but they are not. They responded to my criticisms and are sending me a sample of another product they feel I might like better."
3,good for one cup,if you wanna have one cup then is it a good coffeemaker.but for two cups sucks. you have then one half full cup andone very full (1.5 full) cup
5,This album is for the lovers of cool swing!,I have enjoyed listening to this album! All I wanted was nothing but fat swing from the main man Thelonius Monk! I recommend this album to jazz listeners everywhere!
5,Martinusen combines poetic prose with masterful pacing,"Cindy Martinusen has masterfully woven the past with the present in Winter Passing--and somehow made me analyze my own preconceived notions. She has combined beautiful poetic prose with masterful pacing and characters that are not predictable. Her strong research and attention to detail put you right in contemporary Austria--a wonderful, can't-put-down trip from the first page to the last. I recommend it highly."
4,Some Smudging of ink happens,"I bought this product because of low pricing. It arrived in time. The packaging was excellent. Installing this cartridge was very easy. The brightness of the black imprint is very good. I have seen some problems however. When a stack of several pages printed, some ink shows on the page above. Also I noticed occasional smudging, making it less sharp. I hope these issues will go away after few days."
1,Not for glass top ranges,I bought this expecting a high quality product but the bottom is not flat and it does not work well on my glass top range. I would not buy this again. Only way I can use it is to go outside and cook on my gas grill's side burner. Bummer.
3,not the handvac for me,"I have 3 toddlers to clean up after all day. Cheerios, playdoh, flying food...you get the picture. After using the Root for a few weeks, I'm considering bringing my Dirt Devil back in from the garage. I love the suction and cool whirly riot you get as the dirt flies around. What I dislike is the weight of the vacuum, the size of it and the odd backing it into the charger; which you do quite often. Also, who wants to hold the switch 'on' the whole time while you are vacuuming. Would it have been so hard to make it on and off? And one more thing...the suction area is very small. I routinely get it jammed up with things that my Dirt Devil would eat for breakfast. Yes, it's sooooo cool, but try to stick it under a bed. Good luck."
4,Loved it starting the 6th month,"My hubby got me this when I was only 3 months pregnant. At that time I didn't appreciate the snoogle yet. It pretty much stayed on the floor and I used pillows instead.When I started to get big...around 5.5 months, I really started appreciating the Snoogle! Now that I'm in my 7th month I can't even imagine how I'd sleep without it. I am literally 'snoogling' up to this pillow every night.Since I've had it for a while now I'd had the opportunity to wash it several times and although it is softer - it's nothing close to my sheets.If you're concerned about the price...think about the value of your sleep. I value my sleep and am glad I can enjoy my rest now before the baby comes."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Gaseous, but smart.When the astronomy types detect a giant titular object heading Earth's way, they get rather stressed, and there is a bit of a conspiracy to keep things quiet.It becomes a bit hard to do that when it turns up, and it is discovered it is actually intelligent, not just your random cosmic disaster.2.5 out of 5"
2,A misfire,"Revolver aka Blood in the Streets aka In the Name of Love is a disappointingly bland and overlong Sergio Sollima cop thriller with a miscast Oliver Reed complete with bad American accent (despite playing an Italian prison warden!) and Fabio Testi only marginally less wooden and ineffectual than usual caught up in a political assassination and kidnapping. Nothing out of the ordinary with some absurd plotting (a politician faced with death threats walking casually through the Place Vendome just so he can get killed, a ludicrous jailbreak from a prison with only rotten wood over the shower windows), the last reel is fairly good when the politics briefly kicks in and the movie refuses to go for the soft and easy ending, but it's outstayed its welcome by then.A decent extras package includes a featurette with Testi and Sollima plus trailer and stills gallery, although the 1.85:1 transfer is grainy in places."
4,Your Never Covered,"The skillet cooks great. All you have to do is preheat properly for good results.But, a lid/cover would be a nice option."
3,disappointment from the start,I actually ended up giving it away because you must have he game disc in at all times when you play the game. You cannot put it on the computer and play when you want and where you want easily. Otherwise it was fun.
4,MCM and their MONSTER record!,"mcm and the monster rips on their second full-length release. if you've seen them live, you'll appreciate this cd much more. the quality may not be the best, but a solid album nevertheless!"
4,"a few bobbles, but overall very enjoyable","I agree with chiisuchi that the Dark Horse episode was a bit of a puzzler, but I found it fun nevertheless. I was far more confused by ""Flowers and the Detective Part 2."" I also had some issues with some of the translation, but I've come to expect that with anything Tokyopop does. Nevertheless, I had been waiting for this volume for months, and I enjoyed every second of reading it. D and Leon continue to have a wonderfully suggestive relationship, and the whole thing is tons of heebiejeebie-inducing fun. I think this manga (and the too-brief anime series) is really underappreciated. Tokyopop says there shouldn't be such a long wait for volume 5 -- thank goodness!!"
2,Going Down Hill.,"Shania is on a downward slope. The two version of the CD packaged together are a good deal, but I wish the matial was stronger."
5,Great book,This book was good for children and adults alike. Very well written. It has become a cult favorite in my house we cant wait fourth next one to come out.
2,Too broad; Not what it appears to be,I bought this book last year because I thought from the cover that it was a style guide. It's not. In fact it have very little to do with fashion or style.This book is Anna Johnson's advice about life. It covers everything from relationships to food to charity. It's way too broad and I am not sure why Ms. Johnson would be considered an expert in many of these areas. Because it's so broad the advice is generic.Ms. Johnson is a good writer and I have enjoyed her fashion writing elsewhere but this book is not for woman who have any common sense of their own. It might be good for teenagers.
5,Great Item,"Got this for a Christmas gift for my daughter at her request.Looking forward to see her artistic ability grow.Fast,fast shipping.Great seller."
3,Not for those with pigmented lips...,"Demure is a really beautiful lipstick. The color is very complimentary and something that I really wanted to like.I have pigmented, naturally rosy lips and unfortunately, Demure just doesn't show up all that well. It is barely noticeable.The formula sits nice on my lips, but I would be careful to moisturize first or else it will be drying.Although Demure is advertised as a creme, I found it to have the slightest bit of shimmer to it.I don't know how this shows up on lighter lips, but for those with darker pigmentation, Demure doesn't have enough pigmentation to be truly noticeable."
4,Return of the Wolfman,"What a fabulous book! It's a shame that it's out of print (I own two copies)as any fan of the Universal Monster Movies will enjoy this tremendously.It begins at the climax of the movie ""Abbott & Costello meet Frankenstein"" (a favorite of mine)but does not dwell on A&C. Explanations of the so-called ""demise"" of the Wolfman and Dracula are given as well as why there is an old castle on an ""island"" off Florida's coast. Although the story centers on the Wolfman, a great deal of coverage is given to Dracula, with Dr. Morney (Sandra) and the Monster given ample coverage. It is also a shame that Ken Jacobs took over what had been a great start to a promising series. He went off in a different direction and lost the atmosphere of the would-be series. Hopefully Mr. Rovin will return to the subject matter and use other characters in Universal's menagerie as well as he did with the BIG THREE (Frankenstein, Dracula & the Wolfman)."

5,Prostate supplement,"Of all the prostate aids I've tried, this one seems to help. I will probably order another supply. Works for me."
1,Worn Out Words,"Pollyanna is a digraceful novel. There are many misspelled and worn out words.In 1907 women did not have the right to do anything they want. So they looked up to Pollyanna and her joyfulness. Now, women have the right to do anything, unlike back then.I would not recomend this realistic fiction book to anyone. It is horrible."
4,Laugh out loud funny!!,"I loved Booty Nomad. It reminded me of many interesting situations with women in my own life, and the one-liners were hilarious. I can't wait to read it again. It's mainly a book for guys. I think that most girls would find it completely chauvinistic. Trust me guys, you'll love it. You'll support him, and feel sorry for him at times. You'll totally relate to all of his problems, especially how to deal with 10 different types of women at the same time. A highly reccommended read."
3,Average 3D.....above average price!,"3D was average and actual video material was boring for anyone over the age of 10. Also after it arrived I turned on my new Samsung 46"" LED 3D to one of my DirectTV channels that show 3D videos and documentaries and to my surprise this exact DVD title was being played. In fact it's been on all week at various times and I recorded it with my DVR to see if there were any differences in the quality of the 3D.. My conclusion is not enough to pay the $20 in price. If you have DirectTV and a DVR receiver save your money and record it!"
3,A little odd,"This novel wasn't well-written. Not anything much really happens til the end and it's not that interesting even then. For the whole first half of this novel I just thought ""this is a strange novel."" And ""what is the point?"" The main character is obsessed with her height -- we are reminded she is tall 50 times at least. And it took me a while to figure out what year we were in. Hmmm...Smurfs and Barry Manilow -- late 70's? I also couldn't figure out why the character Gwendolyn is in the novel since she had no influence on any character.Still, three stars for a decent, happy ending, quick read, and some good insight into how divorce affects teens and their relationships with others in the family."
5,"exploration of the here and now, the there and later",A man arrives on an Island to engineer an oil deal. He begins to like the place. It is a nice place. But one of the old money family wants to sell it out for greater access to the contents of a Sears-Roebuck catalog. In the end evil triumphs because good is pacifist and big oil money can buy more guns.
2,Not very secure,"I did not find this item to keep the computer very secure . to many sides are open and it does not hold the computer in place. In addition I am looking for something with a closed top so that no dust , or dirt can enter . Also if it were somehow attached to the case it would be less likey to fall out too.Not a very smart case"
1,A Prime candidate for pulping,"Another nasty little revisionist in the mould of David Irving. The only reason it gets 1 star, is that the combo box doesn't offer negative numbers.The left may attract the loonies, but the far right seems to have a magnetism for third-rate minds, (consider the rulers of the Third Reich). The states right Dilorenzo is so eager to defend were built round the assumption that it was OK for one human being to own another. Sorry, human rights come before states rights. This book is simply another in the long dreadful line, that says its OK to be horrible to people different from the writer, because, according to the writer, they aren't really people (cause they aren't like them).Frankly, don't buy this, and I'd rather hope my profile doesn't give me any similar recommendations in the future"
3,"Good, but too thick and too strongly scented","Pretty decent product, but it is very strongly scented and is actually a bit too thick. It is hard to evenly spread the cream over a large area (like legs) and the razor blades get clogged with cream after each swipe-- which is hard to rinse out of the blades for continued use."
1,Ugh.....,"I do not recommed this at all for someone who wants some truth to the story line. It's a good movie, in the Hammer House style. But, as a Phantom movie, it's just horrible. The only good part in the movie is where the phantom is playing Bachs Toccata and Fuge in D minor on the organ. Of all the phantom movies I've seen, that's one of the best senes. But, over all it was a terrible movie."
3,Good information....,Loaded with lots of helpful information. The biggest turnoff for me was her 'overuse' of the 'evolution' idea. That is hogwash! Golden Retrievers (as everything on this Earth) were CREATED by God! UGH! Other than her twisted beliefs and ignorance on creation...it's a helpful book!
2,"Pass on "" The ABC's of Success in Simple Terms""","The book attempts a great concept but falls short. Sometimes confusing and misleading, the author seems to lose focus from what he started out doing in the first few pages to the last one. Mostly common sense, and little insight your money may be best spent elsewhere."
3,BEWARE: DVD may not play in your PC,"This is a witty, completely charming romantic comedy. David Niven is at his best. Beware, though. I was very disppointed to find that this on-demand DVD-R will not play in my laptop DVD player/recorder. Nowhere does the Amazon web site warn about this, but the packaging bears the following warning: ""This disk is expected to play back only in video 'play only' devices, and may not play back in other DVD devices, including recorders and PC drives"".I frankly think it inexcusable that Amazon does not tell you this before you buy. I give the movie four stars and Amazon two, for an overall rating of three."
1,Made my throat itch,"No mention of sensitivity in description. I gave it to my husband. No feedback from him, yet."
1,Celestron Oceana,I really wanted to give these binoculars a good review being that they are from an American company right near my home but sadly I cannot. The first pair I purchased were defective when the illuminator button fell out when I opened them to first examine them. The second pair I recieved were also defective because the Illuminator did not work at all and there was a black splotch in the viewing area that was internal and could not be cleaned by me. I give up. I will save my money and buy some Steiner's now.
3,Finally a decent Lopez film,"The movie was enjoyable even though Jlo was in it. I don't think I ever watched a Jlo film to the end until this one. She is still a losey actress. The movie was funny. Especially the Sean Penn line "" Is everybody in this town on drugs"" It looked like he actully enjoyed this movie. It had a great cast. Enclulding Nick Nolte and Powers Boothe."
2,Garage Inc. rightfully called Garbage Inc.,"When I say this, I mean this, I am the biggest Metallica fan out there, I absolutly love their music. When I first bought this album I knew it was all covers. Well in short I bought this, and I found about 7 songs that I liked on it. Usually on Metallica's CD's I like all of them, and I never I mean NEVER get tired of hearing them. After about a month I couldn't stand to hear them any longer. This CD isn't that muscially good. But in part, I need to say that Metallica is still the greatest band ever. They just played covers, made millions on it, hey I dont blame them, dont buy this album, just listen to it somewhere else."
3,"Advice is sensible but the examples are ""out of touch""",No doubt that Drucker is a master when it comes to what makes executives effective. But his advice is a lot about common sense and his examples of effective leadership often date back to the mid-50's and earlier. I enjoyed reading the book but finished it being neither motivated nor changed.
2,Fancy screen saver,"To begin with, I'm a huge fan of photographer Yann Arthus-Bertrand. I've seen his work in Chicago, and his messages (imagery & captions) are extraordinary. I have many of his books.This DVD is simply a screen saver. Not a documentary unlike I originally thought. I would highly recommendHome [Blu-ray] by the same director / photographer.Also, part of the low rating is that I watchedHome [Blu-ray] in blu-ray. Looking at the images of ""Earth From The Air"" in standard definition doesn't do the pictures justice. If this DVD is published in blu-ray, I would consider it."
4,Historical,"This book has the feel of a man pooring out his soul. He told the truth as he saw it and I saw no reason to find fault with his history. To get a good feel for the book go to Charlie Rose archives and watch his interview with McNamara and the producer of his documentary.One thing that will upset many people is to see how McNamara changed over the years but then refused to speak up when he believed the Iraq War was wrong. He knows the war was built on lies but still refused to speak out. That seems to me to mitigate the pooring out his soul for VietNam.I would hope that the brainiacs like McNamara, et al, would somehow try to protect the American people but that does not seem to be the case. Such it is with politics.Rick Clark[...]"
2,Deflated expectations,"The title was promising, but the book says precious little about politics. Pity, it could be interesting. The recommendation is as sound as it is obvious: eat better, exercise more and you will lose weight, but beyond this there is nothing in this book that would be worth reading. Worse, the writing is incoherent and ranting. It may pass for a 'motivational speech' but put in print it is really annoying. Ms. Powter takes liberties with facts, or rather is ignorant of them, for instance, by claming that one cannot gain fat weight by eating anything but fat. Untrue. Sugar converts to fat very nicely. It is fat that cannot be converted to sugar. (There is more.) She, in her mind, has discovered the final and the only correct understanding of the problem of obesity, and anyone who disagrees with her is wrong. She hasn't. I was disappointed and would recommend many better written and more factually sound books."
1,Remington has really slipped...,"Unfortunately, there are not many women's electric razors on the market. I replaced my second Remington with this model, after it died after a year of use. I bought this one just a few months ago, and it has just died. My first lasted several years. I guess I'll be going back to regular razors, because I am not going to pluck down $40 - $50 every few months to replace a razor. This shaver was by far the worst... after several uses, it became very noisy, and did not provide as close a shave as my Smooth & Silky Plus that died after a year of use. Emails to Remington have been ignored. Buyer beware!"
5,Magnificent production,"I only viewed the International version of this film, so I cannot compare it with the shorter version. In fact, I have only viewed two John Woo films...Face/Off and Broken Arrow, neither which come close to this epic story. This is definitely a war movie, full of brilliant strategies but also a movie about relationships, loyalty and trust. Spectacular scenery, settings,costuming and choreography."
3,Dry markers,"The markers that aren't dried out are great. However, 2-3 were bone dry and worthless. I had to throw them out."
4,Excellent Boots,"It's hard to find flat heeled boots that are comfortable and stylish, but these certainly fit the bill. Great boots, wonderfully comfortable!!"
1,Big Disappointment,I never thought I would be sorry after buying a BOOK from Amazon - the greatest disappointment! At least HALF OF IT is missing - sections 2 and 3. I have ordered 2 books on more or less the same subject- performance measurement- and both of them have the same FAULTS - missing pages! And I have paid a lot of shipping taxes from USA to Romania for WHAT?One thing is clear now for me: no more online shopping with Amazon!
1,Magical? Hardly.,"I bought this a few years ago when I was a hardcore Beatles fan... and was extremely, extremely dissapointed. If I wanted to watch stoned people act stupid I could go to a club, which I'd rather do than spend the $ I wasted on this film.Bottom Line: You had to be there to like it."
2,WAKE UP AND SMELL THE COFFE TRENT,Wow they a sucker is born everyday. Well Iam a sucker. His info is outdated I dont care what his review says because that is his job so you would buy it. Most of the stuff is just plain. The section that got me upset the most is the section getting a new soc sec #. Sorry you try it like you do in the book and guess what you wont get nothing.
5,"Terrific with details, flows nicely together.","This book is one of the only Aurthirian books I've read, yet I loved the way it shows a transition from the Old Ways to Christianity. It shows how brutal it was, the fights, the wars. Overall an awesome book!"
3,Great VHSc replacement,"This is a great inexpensive camcorder. MUCH easier than our VHSc camcorder that has been sitting in its bag for 5 years now and also better than the short videos we can record on our digital camera. After you are done you can just ""finalize"" the DVD, put in in your DVD player and watch the movie.I blank miniDVD-R are inexpensive (I got 50 for $20) and very easy to store.One minor complaint. The ""finalize"" option is only available if the camcorder is plugged into wall power. This is no problem but there is no way to know that unless you read the small comment burried in the manual somewhere that mentions that. Having that comment on the camcorder ""finalize"" menu would have been a lot more stright-forward."
4,Take A Sad Song And Make It Better,"Best Wilson Pickett album I've ever heard.David Allman's guitar playing ain't bad either.Buy it, you'll like it"
1,Ridiculous,"I can't even give it a star but it's a requirement. Part surmise part fact, this is not definitive in any aspect of the word. He cherrie picks his way through the evidence."
4,If you like mindless computer games skip this one.,"This computer game makes you THINK. It doesn't have stupid little riddles or mechanical puzzles that you can do mindlessly once you figure them out. I played this game at a friend's house and she kept saying, ""Do you see the significance of this?"" She ended up explaining everything. The only part I didn't like was that you had to walk around to all different places and remember where everything was, so you would really need to take notes. This is not a game you can finish in a week at the end of the day. I give it 4.5/5 stars."
4,"A brutal, dark look inside the mind of a man on the fringes.","Baum has written the nineties version of Jim Thomson's Killer Inside Me. Unsparing, direct and without condescending to his main character, he captures a mind reeling from boredom and outsider status. A brave book."
2,Kindle version,"Had high hopes for this one...The writing was maybe a bit stilted in places, but the ideas and characters were at least interesting. I gave up a couple of chapters in, though. It seems like the Kindle version might have been OCR scanned, because there were a pretty fair number of typos and formatting issues. The typos were sometimes bad enough that you actually had to stop and step out of the story while you figured out what the sentence was supposed to say.Overall, the Kindle version was bad enough that I couldnt enjoy the book, and I ended up putting it down and starting another book. I'd say, if the book seems interesting to you, consider it in paperback instead."
2,it was pretty bad,"they say its aimed at kids, theres bad words in it! the captions arre hard to read"
5,Forbidden Planet,"In a decade of giant bugs movies and ultra low budgets Forbidden Planet stands out as a film of wit, intelligence and impressive special effects.Well worth the viewing. The extras are a must for the person who likes the inside look of the film making process.Now that the cast is all gone I wonder where Robbie the Robot is these days?"
2,Thigh tourniquet,"As everyone else has mentioned, these suits run small. I found they run even smaller than I could have imagined. Talk about tight thighs! I normally wear a size 30, so I ordered a size 32. Even these were too small to wear. I would have to wear a size 34 to be comfortable, and I wasn't about to order that. I also found the material to be a little irritating. I might not notice it for a short workout, but for longer stays in the pool, it might be a bit uncomfortable. Returned these bad boys in a flash."
1,sad and weak,Griffin has been one of my favorites for years. This book however is a sad disappointment from such a wonderful writer. Why did he even bother to publish it?Clumsy throughout it leads me to believe Griffin did not really write this book.
3,"NOT, a shaving razor...","This blade is much more of a showpiece than anything usable for shaving. If you're a collector or are putting together a corner of the bathroom for retro beauty, you could do a lot worse than this blade. The handle is not plastic as written previously, it is wood and the rivets are pretty solid but the blade is completely not suited for shaving."
5,Excellent!,"A wonderful book for all women, but especially those struggling with self esteem or acceptance issues. A lovely, thoughtful book for a gift."
2,This book stretches the realm of the ridiculous,"Reading the synopsis I expected something a little far-fetched. Blonde american girl is swept away by mysterious desert sheikh and all that. But this book is beyond ridiculous. I could accept the rather absurd circumstances of the plot, but the characters' reasoning and motivation that attempt to move the plot along are so silly and vapid, I was very tempted to put the book down. On top of that, the heroine is just annoying. Why do people assume that ""old fashioned values"" has to be synonomous with stupid and naieve. The heroine expresses surprise and confusion when an obstetrician reccommended to her is a ""woman doctor""! Women in medical school? I didn't know I could do that. And here I have been chained to the stove all these years."
4,do you really want to make vegan desserts?,"If you really want to make vegan desserts at home, this is a good reference. However, be prepared to shop for hard-to-find, expensive ingredients like arrowroot, kuzu, and agar. Also, I wish the author included approximate times for each recipe, like some of my other cookbooks do. I made the tofu frosting, and even though it was good, it wasn't good enough to justify the two hours it took to make. I think this book is good enough to give it four stars, but I've discovered that, personally, I'd rather just go to a vegan bakery than bother doing it myself."
4,Good complement to the ADD & ADHD Diet,"I read the ADD and ADHD Diet first and found that reading Driven to Distraction was a good complementary title. With both books, I had all the information I needed to cope with my personal situation."
1,Waste of money,"I ignored many reviews about this iron, and purchased it 2 years ago. When it worked, it worked great, I never left water in it, cleaned it after every use, and it just stopped working, 3 times. I sent it back to the company, since it was only 2 months old and they sent me a new one. After 5 months, that one also stopped working. I brought it back to the store and they replaced it once again, and after 4 more months, the new one stopped working. I wanted this iron to work out, because it was good when it worked, but 3 irons in less than a year and a half?"
2,A disappointment from a favorite author,"Margaret Atwood is a cut above the rest. ""The Handmaid's Tale"" and ""Alias Grace"" were unique and gripping works of fiction with characteristic traces of Atwood's element of science fiction/fantasy. This book, however, was very disappointing. It ambled on and on, and although Atwood shows off her exceptional talent through a diverse range of character portrayal, the plot left much to be desired. Don't bother."
1,Poor locking design,"I was very disappointed with this teaball. It is not readily apparent from the picture but this product is actually shaped like a small cylinder, 3cm high with ~ a 6cm diameter. The cylinder twists apart in the middle to open. The problem is that first of all it is not tall enough to grasp firmly and has no 'handle' points, and second the actual locking mechanism is simply based on a push and twist design, but the metal parts do not fit together properly and are very hard to twist. Wrenching the teaball seems a good way to get tea all over the floor.In fact, this first day I received the teaball I practiced opening it several times and eventually it became stuck, I was unable to open it until the next morning. Even if my particular product was somehow bent I cannot see how this mechanism could hold up to repeated use.Hopefully Amazon will have another teaball soon."
1,This is a seriously bad story,"Forget it. All you one-star ratings hit the nail on the head. This is a terrible novel. Man, I skipped whole chapters sometimes. I didn't want any re-education on global warming issues. I wanted an entertaining story to relax with. In the end, I couldn't finish it, and have it up for resale at EBAY! Maybe Ill get some of my poorly spent cash back? Dont waste your money on this book."
2,Not what you're looking for,"I bought this flashlight with the expectation of exceptional brightness out of the light as was indicated by several reviews. There are 21 eyelets on the light - NOT LEDs. At best this does no better than a decent single LED light in terms of brightness. Also, the LED for my purchase failed after a very short lifetime (<8 months). There are much better options out there for less money."
3,Screeching Thru a Muzzle,"This book is okay. It's a great read when Weasel is talking about his old band, Screeching Weasel, but is completely boring when he drones on about past day jobs or solitary hobbies (like running). Some critics say Weasel is the punk-rock Charles Bukowski, but that's an inacurate comparison. Where Bukowski was brutally honest, Weasel is annoyingly evasive, choosing to hide behind his stadium-sized ego. This book would have been great if Weasel talked more about what helped make him a punk-rock celebrity, namely his ex-girlfriend of 10 years and his old band. That said, this book does have two fantastic articles, one on Weasel meeting Curt Kobain, the other -- previously unpublished -- on advice for novice musicians."
2,Skip the first 200 pages,"Oh my goodness! We chose this for a book club book. It's a very hard read. It's difficult to get beyond the first 200 pages because the author delves into minutia. He is also a misogynist. By the end of the book, I couldn't stand James Agee."
5,A Breakthrough Musical Effort,"This album is probably as important a work as the Beatles' ""Sgt. Pepper"" or Milton Nascimento's ""Clube da Esquina 2."" However, if your ear is not tuned to Brazilian and world music, you probably won't be able to fathom that. Brown's fusion of Bahian axe music, northeastern rhythms, bossa nova, rock, funk and reggae is really groundbreaking. To truly understand what he has done, I would recommend perusing the book ""The Brazilian Sound,"" which explains the significance of the work quite clearly and also is a great guide to Brazil's music of the last few decades."
4,Cute & Enjoyable,Sadly it seems all of the funny clips in this movie can be seen in the previews/trailers. Not exactly the Action packed film I expected but still enjoyable to watch.
2,Abridged release of original film,"This is a mildly interesting release, most engaging when Joe E. Brown and Zasu Pitts are on the screen. Jeanette MacDonald shows why she went on to bigger and better things, while the other men in the cast, including leading man John Garrick, show why they didn't make a lasting impression in Hollywood.The most disappointing aspects of the Kino Video release are the running time - only 67 minutes - and the black and white image throughout. The original print runs for 78 minutes, with the final scene in vivid (for the time) color. This uncut version with the color finale was recently shown on Turner Classic Movies. Dare we hope for a release of the complete original film?"
5,A fascinating and enjoyable book,"This is a beautifully written biography of Naples. I found myself drawn into this book and could hardly put it down. Not only is it an enjoyable read, this book is well-suited for a wide audience -- from armchair travelers to academics. Despite its rich and fascinating story, Naples has long been overlooked as a subject in the English-speaking world. Having read numerous histories of Florence, Rome and Venice, I was excited to finally find a history of Naples. Kudos to Dr. Lancaster for so wonderfully bringing the story of Naples to life!"
2,"Easy, yes, delicious, no","I bought the Kuerig in Sept of 2008. I loved the easability of it, but found it very very noisy. I tried at least 50 different types of coffee and none of them knocked my socks off. I guess if you are not a serious coffee drinker then it would suffice. Also, the coffee is not very hot. I then tried sampling coffee from the new Dolce Gusto and I am sorry Kuerig, but you can't hold a candle. The Dolce makes drinks that rival any coffee house. It runs on 15 bars of pressure which aerates the coffee and foams the milk for cappuccino. You can make a cappuccino or a latte, from thought to cup in under two minutes. And it is so quiet, my husband doesn't need to turn the TV up everytime I want a cup of coffee"
4,Carbon pre filter,Item works as described. No problems cutting to fit my air cleaner. Just use a decent pair of scissors. I will buy again.
2,Paper is better.,I used this filter for a while. I would buy good quality Starbucks coffee but i didn't like the flavor of my coffee. About two weeks ago i switched to a paper filter and the flavor of the coffee is much smoother and flavorful.
5,Buy this movie!,This movie is so funny!!! I would definetly recommend it to anyone with a sense of humor.
1,wait... it gets worse,"I read where someone said what they liked was that it didn't focus on one or two characters. Are you kidding me? That's the whole problem. There is no character development. They introduce you to a million characters, then kill them. We get no history, no development, no linking, no compassion or detail, no story, just here they are... opps... they're dead. Save your money. Even if it's onsale for a penny."
5,You will laugh and cry with joy....,"A ""feel good movie"" if ever there were one...Funny and Romantic...some great supporting actors other than Cher and Cage. A movie to invite a couple over to your house for ""dinner and a movie""..."
4,Lunar: A classic for almost anyone!,"Lunar:Silver Star Story Complete is one of the best games I have ever played. Not for the graphics(what do you expect, it's a Sega CD remake), characters(well, I did like most of them), or for a unique feature, but for the story and the solid gameplay involved.A short summary: Lunar is about a kid named Alex living in the town of Burg, several miles from the mainland. He dreams of becoming a hero, and gets his chance when his best friend Ramus decides to go on an adventure. Together with his childhood sweetheart Luna and his annoying pet Nall, they go on a series of adventures that definately end up where you wouldn't suspect.For fans of Lunar, Working Designs, RPGs, and solid gameplay, this is for you. If graphics really affect you or you hate RPGs, then you might have second thoughts."
1,Not cajun food,"I live in New Orleans. Emeril is a well known celebrity around these parts because of all of his restaurants and his TV shows. However, as popular as he is, the locals realy don't consider his food to be authentic. Emeril has taken classic New Orleans cooking, and 'Emerilized' it to a point that it is something completely different. A true native to New Orleans would not really appreciate Emerils version of something as simple as fried crawfish tails. This book is the same. While there are some 'interesting' recipes, they are not authentic, nor are they necessarily that good. I tried almost all of them, just to see how they would be. This was a sad mistake. Don't be fooled into thinking Emeril is a master Cajun chef. He's not. He is probably much better at pasta or other regional dishes."
5,Eagles Live,An excellent purchase! A must have for anyone who likes the Eagles band or music from the 70's and 80's.
4,"the cult,s electric rocks!!!","the cult,s 1987 release[electric]was the follow up to their 1985 release called [love].with electric the cult decided to go with a more straight ahead harder rocking sound and with rick rubin producing they did this with flying colors!!the album cover is also another one of the coolest in rock.in my opinion the great cuts are;wild flower,lil devil,electric ocean,love removal machine,outlaw,bad fun,born to be wild and king contrary man.as a cult fan i would definately get this!!!i hope they eventually release the extended version of love removal machine which was a 12 inch single release in 1987 and the extended version is great!!"
1,awful,I can only give a review of the first 30 pages of the book because I couldn't bare reading the rest. Greg Bear is an incredibly incompetent writer. I can't believe he can actually make a living writing his garbage. His writing is filled with grammatical errors that would embarrass a high school student and is peppered with nonsensical technobabble that makes reading the book a frustrating and tedious chore. Stay away from this book. You'd be better off reading a comic book.
2,Pretty annoying and lacks realism,"My two year old is EXCITED about having a new baby. She is not scared. She does not need to see or hear (from this video and library books we have checked out) negative reactions. So, maybe when the baby comes, she will be scared or react strangely, but this video was awful. I wouldn't recommend it. Also, it was way too long for an active toddler."
5,This album blows away the original CD,"Now this is a CD you will definitely want to grab up while they last.The bonus tracks should have been included the first go round...but, oh well.The sound is much stronger and louder than the original CD....it matches the other masters well.WHEN ARE THEY GOING TO RELEASE THE ""BIG GENERATOR"" ALBUM IN THIS FORMAT???????"
3,Good book at a reasonable price,"The trouble with computer/development books is they are so darn expensive. I was able to locate this one at a reasonable price, the seller shipped it quickly, and I am happy with the purchase. The only comment I have on the book, is this copy came from a public library (stamped inside) and as such the front/back covers are a little beat. I'm sure if this copy were used by just a person this wouldn't be the case, but I suppose live and learn on what a 'used book' really means, right? Overall I am satisfied and would do business with the seller again... after all you shouldn't judge a book by its cover, and this one was a bargain for what its teaching me."
4,Decorating ideas for the clueless...,Offers clean crisp ideas for people like myself who are clueless to decorating. I believe the ideas are easy to emulate. Have gotten and used some decorating tips. Plan to make it a permanent issue on the night stand reading collection.
2,"Screws are cheap, do not buy",Tried installing this door chain today and broke the heads off two of the accompanied screws using only a screwdriver. Now I have to go to the hardware store and find higher quality screws to use. Save yourself the trouble and buy a better product.
3,womack womack,After I played the cd...I found it to be easy listening...both singers sound like beginners...I would not recommend this cd.
5,great,This is identical to the one I use at the gym I go to. I like the fact that it is already inflated. It is a perfect size.
3,Not Really For Beginners....,"Great song choices and great George Harrison intro, but not really a beginner's book. At least it was a little too hard for me."
5,Perfect!,"I love this pie server! It's dishwasher safe, solid and sturdy. The handle fits comfortably in your hand, and the serrated edges neatly and easily slices through with one try. I honestly don't have any complaints about it. For the price, it's totally worth it."
5,Works,I spent a week in the wild with this thing. I typically have a bottle of water next to it and just pour it in before using it. It works well. Just use a painters mask when you empty it!
3,"Too Heavy, But Recommend","Too heavy to carry to classRecommend if you need help analyzing essays for classQuick, easy, and helpful definitions"
5,Great Product,"So it doesn't quite fit the charger plug -- just stretch the material to expose the outlet and the charger connects easily. Love the feel, great protection for the phone. Great product! Product received in minimum time. Highly recommend product and dealer."
5,Great gift,This and the other Ellen book my daughter didn't already have were great gifts for Christmas. My daughter (17) said she was laughing out loud...hearing your child laugh (no matter what age) is music to a mom's heart so definitely a 10 on the good gift scale.
5,lots of fun,"Although this book was written in the 19th century it moves in a breezy and modern pace. It reminds me of ""To say nothing of the dog"" which was written in the current area as a send up of Victorian life and sensibilities. Anyone who enjoys reading about the Victorians will like this innocent and fast moving romance."
5,Excellent portable GPS for vehicle,I enjoy the simplicity of this GPS. Also the screen resolution is awesome for the size of GPS. Very accurate and easy to use.I have seen the other large ones and this has all you need.
4,not great but really good,Harry Potter v was not the best of the series but i really enjoyed it. this book answeard all of the questions that we have been wondering from the beggining of the series. there was great mystery surrounding Sirius's Childhood and other members of his family. there was also a big surprise between the weaslys and the malfoys. this book also brought around the Characture Proffeser Umbridge who at times evoked a very angry emotion. one thing though i think could have been left out was a couple chapters concerning Hagrid and yet another bad decision concerning his obbsesion with out of the rather out of the ordinary animals overall this book is pretty good and i felt there could have been a bit more action but overall it was very nice.
3,"Pleasant, satisfying read","Great little adventure/romance story that reflects the lifestyle and high morals of the time (published in 1939). It was very pleasant to be able to read a good, solid story without worrying about a steamy, explicit sex scene taking away from the story line. The main idea: A young high school graduate is working in a lawyer's office while she hopes to work into a job for the local newspaper. All her friends are off at college, but she can't afford it; however, she is saving to that end. She ends up getting involved in investigative reporting regarding city politics, and is able to solve a mystery that has puzzled the town for several years. There were several story lines on different levels which kept my interest and had me thinking about it for a few days after it was finished. While not a literary masterpiece, it is a nice, satisfying story."
5,Delicate,I was broken harted when I lost my copy of this book and it took me a good two years of finding another copy of it.I am thrilled to have it in my home again.
1,major design flaws,"Sharp design, only problem is they put form over function when designing it. First problem, if the water hasn't drained completely from the upper (non filtered) basin, and you try and pour the pitcher, the unfiltered water pours out with the filtered water. Second problem, when you fill it up, if you let the water overflow the basin, the first thing it does is drain into the filtered basin. In the older round designs, the upper basin was water tight with the lid on, so you could pour out filtered water before the upper basin was empty. If you overflowed the upper basin the water would got over the side and not into the filtered basin. This allowed the user to set it under the sink and not have to stand there for 30 second to shut off the water. They took a definite step backwards with this design. It's really amazing that in the year 2005, such bad product design is still making to the store shelves."
1,Don't buy this!,The sheets and comforter are very scratchy and super thin -- you can see through the sheet when you hold it up. Very cheaply made. Would not purchase again.
4,Wonderful Volume with lots of profound thought,"Except for the numerous passages in Latin which are far above my rudimentary understanding of the language, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The underlying themes went far beyond the apparent murders in the monastery. The writing is at times scholarly but clear and profound. This does not negate the author's skill at presenting a good and engaging story. I enjoyed the movie but the book far surpasses it. I will confess visualizing Sean Connery every time the character William of Baskerville appears."
5,Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium,"I bought this item for my grand niece, and her mother said that Haillie was drawn to it right away. It fits on the inside of a crib, and has several colours, movements of 'fish', and tunes to listen to. My niece also said that this item was very soothing to her baby, and helped her to fall asleep at night and for her naps during the day."
3,50/50,"Eh, not bad, not excellent though. I like the questions really make you think of things you wouldn't really ask. It's creative in that sense. But after a while it starts becoming a Lil boring, to me at least. I still haven't finished the book. I answer a few then get caught up doing something else."
2,Would not recommend,I purchased these as a Christmas gift for my daughter. They take way too long to heat up and the clips leave a crimp mark in her hair. For the money I don't think they were worth it.
1,Perhaps I just got a bottle of water?,"We have very hard water and even using a whole house water filter and a water softener, we still end up with deposits in our toilets. I bought this CLR Bath and Kitchen cleaner because it says ""Quickly cuts through calcium, lime and hard water deposists, soap scum, dulling film and dirt"". It doesn't do anything. I sprayed into one of our toilets and it foamed. Then after letting it sit awhile, I brushed it, stains were still there. I have better luck using plain bleach. Perhaps the bottle that I bought just had water in it. I'm going to take it back to the store and get my money back. I have found that CLR products have always been way over-hyped and have never performed as advertised."
4,very good listen,"overall NIN, is probably my favorite group, but i feel this is the album with the least ability to envoke a reaction. its very easy to listen to the entire cd (it's catchy), and takes almost no ""getting used to"".....it's almost a bit too ""popish"". but that DOESN'T mean that you shouldn't buy this, as this is a great album to own, and has some of their coolest songs in it. i particularly like ""down in it"", ""head like a hole"", ""kinda i want to"", and ""thats what i get"". what's clear though, (from listening to it), is that he developed his true (lyrical, and musical genius), a little later in his career."
2,Lasted 1 year,"This product worked great for about a year, then I went downstairs one morning to have my coffee and it never turned on. After checking the outlet and circuit breaker I figured out the coffee make wasn't working anymore. As mentioned in previous reviews their is a known problem with the machine, which I found out today after looking around for a new coffee maker. The lid builds up steam and runs down the back when you open the lid. Apparently the water gets into the machine somewhere and burns out the electrical system. Other than not working anymore it was nice a machine while it lasted."
4,On the Edge,"By SLLThis second book in the series is action packed. I liked it better than the first book because there is more emotion and excitement. Twig takes on new adventures without the help of his father. He demonstrates courage and bravery which is a theme throughout this book. As Screed leads Twig and his crew through the mire in the Twilight Woods, there are many dangers and surprises. Much to Twigs dismay, their guide is not who he seems to be and creates obsticles for Twig trying to reach ""The Edge"" in order to collect stormphrax-a substance taken from the heart of a storm. In their quest, Twig and his crew fight fearlessly to overcome these obsticles . Screeds collection of toes is disgusting and a mystery to all, and the Stone Pilot is carrying some secrets of his own. If you like action, gore, adventure, and mystery this is a great book for you."
5,Bob the Builder vidoes,"Bob the Builder videos are great! I bought these for my 4 year old son, and I am hooked on them too! I can't wait for new ones to come out! I only let my son watch education movies that teach cooperation, manners, etc. I can't stand movies like Rugrats that have rude, obnoxious children that disobey their parents, etc. Bob the Builder is a winner!"
1,What Is All The Fuss?,"If you're looking for ""confirmation"" of what you already believe in anyway (i.e., that your dear departed are lining up to make a long-distance call via Van Praagh), this is your book. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. Van Praagh provides no reason to believe. Yeah, I know the cliche: ""To the believer no proof is necessary..."""
3,meh.,"I just finished watching the movie and my main problem with the soundtrack is that when the Paul McCartney song comes on in the film, it is supposed to be 2004, but that song is from Chaos and Creation, which was not released until 2005. I love that album, so I noticed the discrepancy right away. Also, there are some great songs in the movie that fit well with the story, but some were left off the soundtrack.Other than that, you've got great songs by Carole King, Nick Drake and The Clientele and there's no doubt Rachel Portman is one of the best and most prolific film scorers out there.An OK addition to your collection if you like filmic instrumental music."
5,Needed to run HP C6180 All-In-One,"This cable is required to work the HP C6180 printer, scanner, copier, and fax. It is not included with the C6180. The store where I purchased the C6180 did not have this cable, and since I am handicapped I couldn't go from store to store to find one. Went to Amazon, of course, found it, and it was sent right away. So easy, why anyone uses gas, time, etc. to find items is a puzzlement and the icing on the cable was that it was a freeship. lynnieff"
3,Fun for an eight year old.,"This toy is a lot of fun for my son. He has been heavily at battle with Optimus Prime. Megatron, sadly, has never been an airplane at my house. None of us can figure it out. My son said, ""It's ok, Mom. The robot is still cool. I mean, he's Megatron!"" Worth it to me."
1,stupid posers... she deserves NO stars,"We don't need anymore of this crap, we have enough, if i could i would put no stars because that is what she deserves. If she had written the songs herself, then MAYBE one, but she has an annoying voice and that crap about not wanting to learn how to play the guitar correctly is crap. She needs to grow up A LOT before she can be taken seriously. She is too old to be dressing and acting like she is a 10 year old at a blink 182 concert. I agree with this ""uncle lester"" and there is much better music to listen to than this crap. You want good music? then go out to a local club and listen to the bands in your area who are struggling to make it and even bring home enough money to eat! that is REAL music... along with the greats like led zep and the beatles and metallica. this cd is NOT worth your money or time."
1,"If You Like Elevator Music, You'll Like This CD","The first Kenny Rankin CD I bought was ""Because of You,"" a spare, jazzy CD from the early 90s. Loved it. This CD from 1980 is nothing like it, though. Producer Don Costa did Kenny a disservice by pouring syrupy ""elevator music"" arrangements on top of Kenny's voice. Do yourself a favor, stay away from this CD, and ""The Kenny Rankin Album"" (another Don Costa production). I'm going to try again with Kenny, but I'll stick to his later stuff and his ""live"" stuff. He's best when it's just him and his guitar or piano--he's great, he doesn't need any ""help."""
3,Pleasant pop album but nothing too memorable.,"Katharines debut is hit or miss. Her stunning voice that she showcased during the show gets thrown to the curb for almost half the album. Too much production and backing vocals mask what a beautiful gift she has, and while I enjoyed most of the songs, I barely can remember how half of them go. The only songs that really stick out which have great hit potential is the amazingly catchy Not Ure Girl and the cheesy, but very very hot, Open Toes, which with a few remixes could be a dance club smash. Ballads are beautiful such as Home and Ordinary World, but as said above she never uses her voice to it's fullest potential. Most of the songs such as Love Story, Each Other, and her first single Over It did start to grow on me after a few listens so I'm hoping after a few more listens more of the songs will. Overall a pleasant pop album that is ejoyable but nothing too exciting or memorable."
3,Steiner's for deployment,"I was deployed do an OEF op and needed a pair of binos. They work great and even came with a case and cleaning cloth. The only problem now is that one side doesn't hold itself up, so even though they are small; it is a two handed operation to look through these. I used to be able to just use these one handed, other than that they work fine."
4,Soul-tastic... All Hail Rhino! Nobody knows box like Rhino knows box,"I stumbled over this set just a few days ago, and I have to say that it's easily one of the top 10 best random-artist compilations I've ever heard in my life, and I own hundreds of them.I won't say there's no filler--by filler I mean the cover tunes--and I'm confused as to why ""What So Never The Dance"" is credited to the Houseguests when this is a longtime Bootsy Collins track? What, is Bootsy in trouble with Warner Brothers and can't re-release his own stuff under his own name anymore?But disc one is an absolute gem--you can't make your own mix better than they've done it here. If you're a fan of James Brown, Parliament, Otis Redding, Sly Stone, the aforementioned Bootsy, Tower Of Power, Prince, early Stevie Wonder, Motown, Isaac Hayes, then you shouldn't be without this set.Absolutely worth buying."
3,Loved the Season,Should have just waited for it to come out on Netflix or reruns. That's what happens when you are impatient.
5,Great game for crossword enthusiasts!,"If you enjoy crossword puzzles, then this is the game for you. The number of puzzles included is amazing (3 years worth of daily puzzles). Also the handwriting recognition is almost perfect and makes it very easy to fill in the puzzles. Trust me, if you like crosswords then you will love this game!"
3,Yoga for the Rest of Us,"The salutation to the sun was way too difficult. I found the rest good, but not broken down so that I could go to the relaxation at the end of the sun movements without doing a fast forward. Would be better if you could go to a title of each."
1,not very good,"when I went to the theatre to watch this, I thought it was going to be very good, because I thought the first movie was good. I was surprised that they tried to ake it into an action movie. I just don't think Harry Potter and action goes together."
4,Most Interesting and Educational!,"After viewing this DVD, I found it very informative and educational. I personally enjoy learning about people's cultures and lifestyles. So learning cultural Ghanian dances, even though different, there was something fun and appealing about doing the dances as I watched. The music was upbeat and the dance moves were rhythmic and soulful. I suggest anyone who's open-minded, loves change and loves to dance.....to check this out!"
2,Not very durable,"I purchased this a few months ago, and I've caught about 5-6 mice with my trap. One day, I found out that the mice could not properly enter the mouse trap, and they ended up chipping the inside parts of the trap, causing the device to malfunction and break down. I have had to trash my trap, and I am not very satisfied with the durability of this mouse trap. Make careful decisions before purchasing this item."
1,One of the worst singers of our time!,"Very plain voice, even off-key on some notes. Zero star appeal.Get another -- any other -- CD from amazon.com!"
4,pretty good but not perfect,We have a 15' Intex metal frame pool. This year I was having a heck of a time keeping it clean so I decided to give the critter a try. First off let me say for you other Intex owners - if you have the stock paper filter pump GET RID OF IT. It does not have the adequate flow to operate the critter. And if it does happen to get it to move around your filter will be plugged in no time rendering the critter motionless. I upgraded to a sand filter and this baby flys across the bottom now. It did a pretty good job cleaning the bottom - not perfect - some scrubbing was still required but hey it still saved me a ton of time. I'm still having trouble with it missing certain spots - I'm guessing it may have to do with the flow jet for the return water coming into the pool. I've adjusted the outlet water jet numerous times - oh well. Overall this thing is an easy 4 out of 5. Its not perfect like I said but its certainly a time saver.
5,Book 'em Dano,The best. The original and the best. The series had started to show its age by this point but still a must-have if you collect classic 70's television.
2,Weak and slow,"When I ordered this book, I was hoping to read a scarey, chilling book. I was wrong. Certain parts of this book were entertaining, but most of what I read was a disappointment. It had a weak plot, a weak ending, and weak characters. It lacked some sort of stability to keep my mind focused. I was disappointed."
4,"""Got To Give It Up...Motown...Island Def Jam...A&M Records""","Much like its predecessor ""LOVE FUNK""(314-541-583-2) digging into the vaults ofMotown, Island Def Jam and A&M Records...with talents from The GapBand...Cameo...Rick James...Billy Preston...Ohio Players...James Brown...MarvinGaye...Con Funk Shun...Commodores...Brothers Johnson...L.T.D.(featuring JeffreyOsborne)...Bar-Kays, giving all R&B collectors something to sink their teeth into.But the highlight has to be ~ ""GOT TO GIVE IT UP""(1977-Marvin Gaye), intoxicating beatwith Live mixing in the background from the London Palladium, have to admit, Gaye is a hardact to follow or beat...and Marvin definitely has the BEAT!So let's get FUNKY...pick this one up and let the party begin---if you enjoyed this one, whynot try ""The Funk Box""(314-541-789-2)...both collections are a REAL GAS!Total Time: 75:03 on 12 Tracks ~ Universal/Hip-O Records 314-541-584-2 ~ (2002)"
2,Less-than-first-rate Vidal,"Gore Vidal is a national treasure and one of my favorite authors, but this is the most disappointing of his novels that I have read. The first hundred pages or so consist of Washington cocktail-party chatter circa 1940, and it doesn't get much better as it goes along. The characters seem oddly detached from the epochal events unfolding around them, and as a result the reader cares little about them. There is much to be said about the machinations of the ruling powers during the period covered in this book; perhaps a work of fiction, although based on fact, is not the proper forum to explore them, as master essayist Vidal must himself have known before finishing this dramatically unsatisfying work. Perhaps he needed the advance to pay the mortgage on his Italian villa? Authors have to eat, too."
3,Uh....Ok...but don't buy it...,"I read this book for a book report and it was interresting, but not captivating. I feel for some of the characters and some of the things that they do, but sometimes I wanted to burn the book. Susan Elderkin clearly wanted to confuse her readers and then tell them the ending half way through.I am an avid reader, and I do agree that her character descriptions were good, but the book overall was not suspensful, nor was it intriguing. I've read it 5 times combing it for things for my book report and character profiles, and you find something different every time because of the great detail she uses. So if you're into detail, this book is great. If you want something suspenseful pick up something else. I personally enjoyed ""The Cabinet of Curiosities"" much more than this book...leave this one and go buy the other...you'll be much happier in the end."
1,Dont like it It just like it say IT dose waste your time,The audio book do not tell you anything that help with meditation It may have been good in its day.
4,what a book!,"I borrowed this book from my friend [the face on the milk carton] and i just read it all during classes it was so great! i felt like i was really inside the book ,so if you are looking for a mi-sti-ri-us book and romantic, confusing exciting, thrilling book all in one, i highly recomend all the books of this series!"
5,Thanks.,Shipped promptly...just as said. Was sent as a gift to the inmates of Vigo County Jail because it was requested and they are seriously lacking in their literature selections since they have done away with the library program.
1,Not accurate at all,I figured this was a low cost unit that had good reviews so i bought one. It's reading 10-15 points higher when tested at the doctor's office. Being returned.
2,"Meh. Ok knife, has design flaws.","A good idea, but has several problems. First, where the clip contacts the frame (not at the anchor point) there isnt continuous frame, but just a nub. This keeps catching on fabric when I go to put it back and clip into the pocket, making it a problem that not only has me fumbling to set it, but also wearing the fabric. Second, the frame is providing the tension for the blade to keep it in the folded position, and has already started losing tension. Wish I had saved for a spyderco."
2,Power supplies burned out,"I bought two of these in the summer of 2002. One died a month ago; the second one died today. Both of them had burned-out AC adapters. This is just not acceptable; devices should last more than 18 months.I would give it 1 star, except that I was so pleased with it when I got it; it was such a joy to have a switch that didn't care if I was using a crossover cable or not, and would connect to other switches as easily as to hosts. These days, though, that's a fairly common feature."
3,Pretty Good,"I read this book after Caldwell's excellent ""Hayek's Challenge"". I don't normally read biographies, but that was so good I hunted around for related material (and found this).Unfortunately, this suffers in comparison. Caldwell is much better at signposting and structuring the argument. In contrast, Hacohen jumps around, often covering the same period in different contexts. And his hand is too heavy - the authorial opinions are often forced (or even plain odd - what on earth does he have against Popper's wife?).Still, his intentions are generally honourable (not always; there's a blind spot as far as Zionism goes) and the final chapter, which places Popper's thought within the current(ish) left-wing context, is interesting."
4,**Sigh** Another year and a half to find out about Matt,"I have anticipated since I found out the name of the book was going to be ""Path of Daggers"" that it would be mainly about Matt since it is a Seanchan saying about the ""Heights of power are paved with paths of daggers"", and since matt is obviously going to marry the seanchan empress, WHERE IS HE??I thought it was pretty good overall, but I miss the fast paced action from the first several books. I really hope that he does not take as long to deliver the next one. Some days I think all 9 Star Wars movies will be out before this series is complete."
3,Cadillac Man,"While I adore Robin Williams and see almost anything he makes, this is definately not one of his best. It's just not really funny. There ae a couple of good scenes and the story line should have made it a winner, but somehow it falls short. The story is about a car salesman who has a deadline to meet of selling 12 cars in a day or be fired. He's in trouble with his ex wife, tries to balance two girlfriends, the Mafia is after him and a brainless motorcyclist runs into the store (literally) and tries to find out who's messing with his girl. He holds everyone hostage and it is up to Robin's character to get everyone out alive. Ending is quite predictable."
2,Basic,"Only if you never worked with SCADA it will help you start, found kind of outdated, but in fact lots of SCADA systems out there are outdated itself, so it helps to understand some old stuff."
2,Elastic Heel Strap,I returned this sandal. I did not know that the heel strap was elastic. My feet were not secure in the sandal.
5,A PERFECT CD,"Quickly, along with the Deftones ""White Pony"", the best of 2000. The more I listen, the more I like."
2,2 Lame,"Another DEEP film by this director. It is so deep that not even God could ""get"" it. I could even make a film if I didn't have to offer a plot. No art here."
2,Not refillable,"This lighter is great and I loved it up until it ran out of fluid, which took about two months. I can't find anything like it that is refillable though. All of the refillable ones are straight and I prefer this. I wish they would make a refillable version."
2,Not quite 2 stars,"This book did not hold my interest. The plot was thin and there was way too much thinking. I found myself skipping through pages and pages. While there was chemistry between the hero and heroine, the conflict was flimsy and they had almost no time together before deciding they were in love. They spent a total of two short meetings in his office and two days and a night together."
5,A+,"Good condition, needed before the arrival tme, but was able to pick it up instantly, which was very great! I was able to walk in and just pick up the book just like that!"
4,Heart-wrenching Documentary,"I had read quotes from critics who said this ""drama"" [my quotes] was a regrettable adaptation of historic events by amateur film-makers who had slapped together a potentially fine story, with poor editing, music, and technical support. While my wife and I did find some technical rough spots, we soon realized that we were watching a true documentary with here and there a dramatization that made the events more comprehensible. We were amazed at learning the details of a history which we had only vaguely known about. Many of our previous miscopnceptions were set straight, and by the end of the film we found ourselves profoundly moved. A must-see film for Jews (even non-practicing ones like ourselves), and recommended for all others with an interest in human history."
2,An Education,"I was not fond of this movie. It is about a girl coming of age and falls in love with an older man. I like both of these actors, but just did not like the story line."
2,Bad research on my part,"8/10/12 I bought all three of his books at once from Amazon. A big mistake. All three are much the same. I expected to learn the methodology behind his approach to meditation. and none of them address meditation at all, let alone the methodology. I thought about returning them but I can't get 10 cents on the dollar. I might donate them to some one but I don't know who? They have a center in Buena Park Calif. which is not to far from me. I think I'll send them there.Ed Holzinger8/18/12 PS. I stand corrected. The last book ie, World Beyond World, discuss the meditation metodology but not the process."
4,So mellow,"When I was really young, I used to bet the other children that I could swallow loose change. The most I ever did was 78 cents and one of them was a quarter."
5,Utterly adorable.,"A charming story about an adorable dragon and little knight who feel they must fight as history tells them to. This book is just for fun and has lovely drawings of the dragon practicing being ferocious and the knight building his armor.Those seeking ""life lessons"" or wanting to apply major psychological motivations to the characters might look elsewhere and just enjoy this sweet story for what it is and the giggles that come forth."
2,Flower That Shattered the Stone,I have no comment because I cannot figure how to listen to the song requested.
2,extra buttons DO NOT WORK on Vista,"I love the ergonomics of this mouse. Too bad that Kensington is falsely marketing it as a ""5 programmable button"" mouse. The software included with the product explictly states that it does not support Vista.How can this be? Vista shipped almost three years ago. It's really hard to believe that Kensington still does not support the most commonly used operating system. I guess they don't really care about their customers.Their software does claim to work on XP and Mac OSX, but if you're on Vista be warned."
3,Good I dea but...,"Ah, it took me FOREVER to get through this book! At the begining the story was really dragging, but I knew that if I could get though it Marjorie Liu's book was next!The series is a good idea for lovers of the Vampire/ Werewolf genre but I don't know if Maverick was the best idea to start it.She did speed up the character developement & Crimson City did end up an OK read. It's not absolutely neccisary to read it before Liu's book, though it is helpful.Fleur Dumont becomes ruler of all of L.A.'s vampires after an assasination of her her step-siblings. Plagued by former scandal, Fleur's causing more by working overly closely with Dain, a human military aget, to e the mmmmmrers. This sets up all the coming tensiuon in Crimson City's series...more vamps to come, along with werewolves!"
3,Disco Fever!,"If you love 70s disco, you'll love The Sylvers. Hot Line, Boogie Fever, Cotton Candy just to name a few. No self-respecting disco connoisseur would miss adding this CD to their collection."
1,WMD Perspective Behind the Times,"Mr. Campbell's work, written as part of his current doctoral thesis at Hebrew University, falls behind the times regarding the rapid paced developments in the field of weapons of mass destruction. His socio-scientific approach stems from this works academic research requirement which was spun off as a coffee table book treatment of this important field. Well researched concerning nuclear weapons, but falling seriously behind in his regards concening biological or chemical weapons. I would recommend this book for those that need a very, very basic, primer concerning nuclear weapons but nothing more."
5,Feel good movie,"This is definitely a chick flick. Richard Gere is a middle age man with a mid-life crisis going on, worn down by his unexciting day-to-day life. He's always wanted to learn ballroom dancing but hasn't for fear of what others might think, particularly his family. On a spur of the moment inclination, he decides to sign up for lessons and finds himself with an interesting assortment of characters who are also taking dance lessons. The students' goal is to ultimately compete in a dance off, which they do, with varying results. Gere's wife in the movie feels betrayed when she finds out what he's been doing, as she doesn't understand why he's been taking lessons. The fact that he has a young, sexy instructor doesn't help matters any. Gere and his wife reconcile at the end and women watching the movie wish they were the ones that Gere was looking at ""like that.""This is a movie to watch when you want something light and to just have a good time."
1,Unhappy,I ordered the video and paid for the one day shipping rates and received it 3 days later. This was a last minute birthday gift which cause me to purchase another gift. I wrote Amazon concerning this incident with no response in return.
2,Hard to get through...,"Unfortunately, I tried to watch this twice and fell asleep both times. I have to say, the trailer made this movie look much more appealing."
3,decent songwriting,"Colin MacIntyre's Mull Historical Society's songs tread the same musical territory as Ed Harcourt's heartfelt take on songwriting. but Mull's album contains a bit more of a twee sound...it must be a Scottish thing. there is quite a bit of talent on display here and Colin has a knack for a great melody, but this 14 song set remains underwhelimg. if it had been trimmed back to an outstanding 10 cuts, this album might have had a stronger impact. there are some shining moments here such as the tracks ""Asylum"" and ""Am I Wrong."" but overall, it's a case of a little too many ideas and not enough quality control."
5,Great for people with very poor vision,"The Bible was given to a friend as a Christmas Gift.Our friend has poor vision because of diabetes and needed a bible she could read without alot of magnafication. Now when she sees and hears about ""Chapters and Verses"" in The Bible,She can look them up in her own personal Bible."
5,Damages is a Beautiful Book.,"I had to tell, to all of you, how much I enjoyed reading Damages. To take a glimpse of the each character's life in this book is like learning consecutive valuable lessons that we can use any moment of our lives. This story is very unique, the author's voice is intriguing and original, but it brings back a lot of situations that we all have experienced. This book made me analyze and understand my family and my relationships with people better than any book before. I am dying to find out what happened next. I am hoping that the author will write the sequel to Damages soon. I thank Bazhe for reminding me of from where I came. This book is a must read for anyone. I recommend the new 2004 version ISBN 0595297145."
1,Quality vs. Crapola,"Okay, I can hardly believe that there are people here who are actually hyping up this stinker of a movie. I can only assume those people are Lucy Liu fans in denial that she made such a bomb, or hardcore action junkies who think anything with big guns is kewl. This couldn't have been worse if it was titled Battlefield Ballistic. The plot is all over the place. Lucy Liu's assasin seeking some sort of redemption idea is played out yet unfulfilled, and Antonio Banderas has never looked older or lamer in his attempt to remain young(stick to Spy Kids, Zorro)."
1,"What is funny about murder, blood, and killing?","I watched this movie because it was billed as a comedy. Yet, as I watched, I kept asking myself what in the world is funny--the blood, killing? It was all to real, too intense.The Littleton school killers laughed as they butchered their fellow classmates. They would have enjoyed this kind of movie.Worst of all, it opens a window into how sick and evil our society has become. People are appluading killing instead of condemning this hateful work as evil."
4,Heart of a Chief,"My class just read Heart of a Chief. i would give this book 4 stars because it was good but some parts I didn't understand.It is about a Penacook kid named Chris Nicola who lives on a reservation. He is starting middle school and the town decided to build a casino on a nearby island. My favorite part is when he takes the stakes and burned them. I learned that anyone can make a difference.By,Jimmy S."
5,good love story,i love anything with Ryan Reynolds but this had a great story and I really liked it. Recommend to everyone
3,OK MOVIE FOR THOSE COMING OF THAT AGE,Maybe I was expecting something else. This movie I gave away after watching it. Perhaps becuase I'm over 40 I simply was not moved by it. But for those who are approaching that societal age of 30 I imagine it would be enjoyable.
5,History that comes alive,"Too often history is written by people that were not there. This is a first hand account of what it was like to live in Soviet Russia under the horrendous government of Stalin. World War II is not just about the battles but about the horrible suffering of everyone. While this book writes about atrocities, it also gives hope by showing good people among the hatefull. I wish I knew what ultimately happened to Nina Markovna and her family."
3,Too much miscommunication,"I thought the story was decently written with some funny moments and some touching moments. I think the main thing that I got frustrated with in this novel was the constant back and forth of misunderstanding between the hero and heroine. Max is an incredibly great guy, and I liked him as a hero very much. Verity is also sweet, and stoic, and I liked her as the heroine. I think together they would have been much better if they just would have talked to each other once in a while and stopped jumping over each others sentences and jumping to conclusions."
3,Buyer,"Looks Gorgeous. Sounds good.Construction is below expectations.Mechanics of the metal lever connecting the top are shakey and more difficuly than it should be.Volume control is AWFUL. It's a wobbly plastic knob. Digital so you click it left or right, not smooth turning like the tuning button.Plastic foundation for vinyl record and the needle bar are wobbly. Do not have feel of quality.Looks great sounds good. Wish it had an aux plug."
5,Nostalgic Lullaby's perfect for night-time or anytime,My 5 month-old son loves music and has fell in love with this CD and its wonderful collection of songs. I use it not only when I'm trying to wind him down for sleepy-time but to gently wake him up after an afternoon nap. We love to sing and sway to the beautiful songs. The songs have a very nostalgic feel and give you a warm fuzzy feeling. I think we'll be using this Cd for many years to come. It puts not only the baby in a good mood but also Mommy!
1,mini- junk,"this mini saw, was usless, the saw guard was in the way,and you could not remove it, this guard, made it impossible to cut the small pices of wood where you made your mark,who ever disigned this had a good idea, but never though it through, or may have not tried it, or tested it now I think it is JUNK>"
5,Good old fashioned Norwegian cooking,This book contains many of the traditional recipres my grandmother made when I was young. When she died her cookbook disappeared-this is a very suitable replacement. I highly recommend this book looking to rediscover their Norwegian roots.
5,Young People starring Shirley Temple,"I think this is a wonderful piece of work by Shirley Temple. Yes, in her early films, she has proven to be a pleasure to watch, but I also believe that in her later films, they are extraordinary, as well, and showcased her abilities to embrace different rolls and carry her acting abilities forward. I believe that she has been underrated as an actress and that all of her films should be made available to the public. Although there are many good films out there, I do believe that classics such as these have been lost,as a whole, and we need more quality films like these."
5,Lots of fun,My son got this for his birthday and he loves it. It keeps him busy and he really enjoys it.
2,"Shouting ""Don't hang up""!","I'm afraid we must agree with reviewer: synelg from Alaska who advised ""Don't buy this phone!""We also thought it was a great phone at first. But, after a little more than a year of use, our friends and family report that our conversation regularly breaks up about 10 minutes into each call and they can't hear us. We find ourselves shouting, ""We can still hear you, don't hang up"" as we run for our old corded phone in the basement. We replaced the NiCad batteries in both handsets, with no improvement.We had a replacement warranty and will now give the Siemens Gigaset 4015 we received a try, but I find myself wondering if we might be better off with a Uniden TRU448-2, an AT&T 2255, or a VTech VT2461."
1,Don't waist your money,"This book is just like the Jesus Seminar. A sham. It is a bunch of egotistical atheists trying to rid the world of Christianity. They like to pick and choose what is true from the Bible based of their great wisdom of the first century. They really like to remove anything that would convict them of any wrong doing in their lives.If you enjoyed the Davinci Code; IE. You are easily entertained and like to believe lies rather than the truth, this is a book for you. If you want the truth about Jesus try, ""More than a Carpenter,"" by Josh McDowell or ""The Case for Christ,"" by Lee Strobel."
5,Single Dispenser - love it!,This was a little smaller than I expected but we LOVE the product!! We put it in our laundry room with soap by our utility sink. I did follow the instructions like filling it with water first to make sure it worked before hanging it up. It doesn't leek. The pump works. It's a wonderful product!!!
5,KLO-Idaho,"Totally amazing story. A good ""history"" lesson on WW II in the Pacific and the Japanese mentality."
2,Amateurish,This video does not seem very professionaly done. Looks as if someone was sitting in the audience with a camera. Grainey on HD TV. Audience shots do not fit in very well. Did not hold the interest of a 2 yr old Gabba fan.
3,"""He's got my badge. Could you get it for me?""","*That was one of the best last lines ever said in a movie!I saw this on MST3K(hence my nickname)and it was one of the worst ones I have ever seen(made for a funny ... episode). A stupid plot(portly sheriff who says ""Son of a..."" a lot goes to Malta for no reason), bad acting, and shoddy scenery. Seems strange that a movie this bad is on DVD. If you like to see a movie where a main character gets out of bed in the same way over and over, and where a man gets shot TWICE in the same scene, get this movie. Or else you can watch it when it reruns again on MST3K.PS: One star for how bad it is, another one for Best Brains for having the guts for air this, and another one for them making fun of how bad it is.*=sarcasm"
2,"Good,but I like the orginal better! DVD lacks features!","This remake of classic of ""The Parent Trap"" is but I like the orginal better!To start off the girls were from New England and California(not California and England! ) . The makers of this remake threw in a bunch of unneed material(like the hotel junk,the women trying to seduce Dennis Quaid,the brief camping trip etc!) As for the DVD , it lacks extra features such as commentary from cast,director,behind the camera,production notes etc! What we got is another bare bones DVD that lack the stuff the other studios such as New Line,MGM,Paramount etc pack into thier DVD's ! if you want to see this movie check your library or your video store to rent the DVD before you buy it! Also Disney when are you going to release the orginal ""Parent Trap"" on DVD? also Disney start improveing your DVD's and bring the consumers the extra features we desire on this great new format that kicks VHS big time!"
5,Fly Web Fly Trap,This product works very well. This summer was very hot and I had loads of regular flies and gnats. This trap with light attracted them and they got stuck on the fly sticky pad. Neat and clean - just through the pad away and replace it with another.
3,Cell Phone,Not too clear on how to set up this device with my cell phone. Not very good instructions
4,Nice and Large,"I bought this to replace a Brita pitcher which was just not big enough for a family of 5, and this has done well so far. It is tall, so be sure it fits your fridge, and the filter takes quite a while to pass the water through, but overall I am very happy with the purchase. The water tastes good, the spigot has not dripped (yet!), and it does not eat a huge chunk of fridge space (it is pretty skinny - most of the space is vertical). I recommend this for anyone who needs more capacity than a standard pitcher can provide."
3,"Ok, but a change in writing sytle...","This book was ok. I really liked the George the fiend story. Of course I read that one first, so that might have something to do with it. The first 3 stories were ok, but they could have been really good stories if there was a little bit more attention to plot/character details and a lot less sex. Most of the first 3 stories seemed to be about sex. I know plot/character development can be difficult in short stories because there isn't as much time to build in details, but it should not be substituted with a lot of sex details instead. I dunno, to me the first 3 stories seemed less like the writing style I've really liked in her series. That being said, the 4th was worth reading. I've always been interested in George the fiend, and it's nice to get some dialog out of him! :)"
4,Great read,This was a good book. I would have liked to read more raunchiness to the story. The sexual scenes were dull and lack details. I like reading a story that leaves visions. Other than that the story line was great. I liked the ending just wished Monique would have got help for her daughter.
2,Not my style,"I'll confess I only made it through the first 2 chapters, then I quit. The info seemed decent, but you really have to like this style of writing, which I don't. I'm guessing the author's 3 main objectives, in order of priority, were (1) be light 'n' breezy even if you say nothing (we learn that the bagpipes are ""an instrument intended to make up for the country's ongoing lack of battle strategy""); (2) imitate David Barry; (3) say something about Celtic history. If you like that style (and it appears other reviewers do), then fine. If you don't, well I couldn't get past the 2nd chapter."
5,A Timeless Classic,"I acquired my first copy of ""Handling the Big Jets"" during my university days when studying aeronautical engineering (at Loughborough University of Technology, Leicestershire, England) in the early 1980s. This was an excellent reference book then on handling jets as it covered all the major topics that I needed comprehensively, in simple and easy to read language and explanations.However, decades later, it is difficult to find a similar definitive book on the subject. This makes ""Handling the Big Jets"" an important part of my library which I consult on subjects ranging from aerodynamics to aircraft control and stability.This is a timeless classic which should be an indispensable part of every pilot and aircraft engineer's library."
4,99 Luft Ballons!,You cannot go wrong with this collection Nena fans. It's a great addition to your Nena cds.It really does seem like a time line of her career.
5,The perfect mix of Afrikan and Islamic history!,"Asalaamu Alaikum if you're looking for a truthful account of what happen during slavery to the West African Nation tribes of the Wolof, Fulani, Mandinka, Mandingo, Tukor, Hausa and How they affected the culture and the traditions of the new world in the Diaspora then read this Book!!As a Muslim and man of AfriKan decent, i can honestly tell you this is one of the most well researched books i have ever read on the history of the Trans atlantic slave trade. The author has a great understanding of AfriKan customs, traditions, mysticism, and history. And her understanding of Islam as practiced in West Afrika is food for thought for the novice and the scholar.Any Afrikan or Muslim should have this on their bookshelf"
4,Way better than those stupid candles,"Live in Atlanta. Lots of mosquitoes. This thingy masks the CO2 and stuff that makes them swarm you and leave you looking like a mutant freak if you fall asleep in your hammock. Puts all other cheap repellents to shame. More expensive methods might kill them or work better, but I don't have that kind of money to throw around on parasitic bugs."
5,Salieri's best CD to date.....,This recording is so great that allI can say to you is this: buy it...
4,Attractive and it works,"I used this hub to attach a usb printer, cd-rw drive, and diskette drive to my new iBook, which had only one usb port. Everything worked well, the color of the hub matched the iBook, and the hub itself was unobtrusive on my desk."
1,Who Wrote This Parker Novel???,"Well...after reading ALL the reviews...I ordered it. I read it. And I ask ""who wrote this Parker book?? I see NONE of him in it and have read the man for years and years. It was an okay read but no snap...no smart mouths..blah endings to what could have been so much more BobbyBoy!! I DID like the ending but even that was sort of oatmeal. Sorry, Robert, whereever you are!!"
4,Quite different from his previous two albums,"Geoffrey Oryema's third album continues to develop his personal style - somewhere between Afro-pop and Brian Eno-esque ambient music, without the cliches of either.As always, Geoffrey's voice is the most essential component, floating here above a more electronic soundscape than he's employed previously.Not as compelling as his second album (Beat the Border), Night to Night remains in frequent rotation through my CD changer. A great album."
2,Boring book with good ending,"This book had a great ending, but the other 300 pages justdragged on. I had to read it for school."
5,Vintage game still fun to play!,Vintage game still fun to play! Bought this form my older kids to remember from childhood. Still fun and cute! Good price arrive quickly I would recommend this seller!~
3,Loud and Strange,"This was the best battery-powered air pump I could find and it works well for traveling, which is why I bought it. But it is very loud and moves almost violently. For some reason the one I have will only work with the battery power. The electric cord just won't work. Again, I'll stress how loud it is. I would only recommend it because of the price and it works for traveling in a car if you wrap it in towels to smother the noise."
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! -[...],"Skyline was the worst reviewed movie of 2010 and not without cause. Basically it's a different version of War of The Worlds, with less of a storyline, and a ridiculous ending. The sad part of this whole thing is that the movie started out really good. After the event, I was on the edge of my seat, and then it all goes downhill from there. Eric Balfour is such a good actor, but he's constantly being cast in these subpar movies. I don't understand why nobody wants to offer him a role in a major motion picture. Once again he's very good and engaging in a movie that just crashes and burns. The special effects were cool, the acting wasn't bad, but the story stinks and the further into it you get, the more you keep asking yourself, why am I still watching this?"
2,Not user Friendly for 6 month old,"I read the reviews and thought this would be the perfect gift for my 6 month old daughter at Christmas. I was very dissapointed in the amount of time it's on before it automatically turns off. To turn it on you press a star shaped button and it begins to do it's little song and dance. However if my daughter doesn't hit the drum in a time frame of about a minute it shuts off. She knows how to hit the drum and will crawl over to it and start hitting it to play but then gets disapointed when it doesn't make any noise. At 9 months, she still hasn't learned to press the button to make it start. She'd play with it more if her patting it started it up again."
4,"Excellent chillout, tropical feeling, grooves","I just got this CD today and it's absolutely INCREDIBLE... Numbers 4 & 5 are fabulous as are the rest. I'm a big fan of Hi-Fidelity vol.1 and Om Lounge vol.2 and this is right up there with them. By the way-- I never knew Bush could do chillout trance?! It's unlike the rest of the CD, but a fabulous addition... I'd say bite the bullet and buy this one-- it's totally worth it if you want some awesome background grooves that could be listened to for hours..."
3,It can't beat the real thing,"I grew up listening to Johnny Cash and have always been a big fan of his. Like Elvis and the Beatles, his music is timeless and very good. It's wonderful that a film like ""Walk The Line"" is now giving the young people of today a chance to discover what a great and gifted talent Johnny Cash was. The music on the soundtrack is alright and the actors do a good enough job with the songs but I have to recommend that if you want to hear John's music and enjoy it to the fullest, buy the CDs from the real Johnny Cash. They are much better. ""The Essential Johnny Cash"" can't be beat and is the one to buy if you want all of his best."
2,Building concrete tanks,This book is mostly about building concrete water tanks. Out west. Very little info about maintaining water quaility - bacteria - etc. In western PA you can't build concrete water tanks because its too frigging cold here. The section on ponds reads like TV Guide. This is a book for western people with water issues.
2,Not Leslie At Her Best,"This one is basically reruns of Leslie's older videos. The Walk Diet was one I'd owned for years, from Leslie's first efforts at videos, I think. It is ok for absolute beginners who have trouble moving. For all others, I'd skip this.The 30 Minute Walk is lots newer than Walk Diet. Has a slick set design, and much more movement. But, again,it's an old video, and I already owned it. Had walked with it many times.The 30 Minute Walk is on the disc twice, and the Muscle Mile One is not on the disc. Also, the blurb on the back of the case says that the Walk Strong Express is done with the stretchie band. However, the actual video has Leslie and her friends using dumbells and other weights. It's a good video, and gives me a good workout. It just isn't the one that the back of the case says it is.Whoever put this one together did not do a good job.Also, I thought I was buying something new, not rehashes of old stuff.If I'd known what was on the disc, I would not have bought this one."
4,A must for students of the Bible,"I purchased this book in anticipation of a class I will be taking on the book of Daniel. I find it interesting that a noted historical figure and respected scientist wrote more in his life about the Bible than he did about science. This fact is obvious when you pick up his book on The Prophecies of Daniel. It is, as expected, well written and full of scriptural references. Newton sites several scriptures as well as some writings from the Maccabees which helps him lay out the History of the book of prophecy in an organized and well thought out manner.Where Shadows Scream"
1,A lot of hot air,"I went to see this movie because I thought it would be interesting. As I learned earlier this movie is based on a true story about the true Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter and how he was framed for shooting some guy. I also think that he was wrongfully accused and shouldn't have been arrested. I think that this movie is even more boring than the pokemon movie. I went to see ""The Cider House Rules"" it is WAY better than ""The Hurricane"". I think that the elderly would enjoy this movie the most because they actually remember this event in time. Another Group of people that would enjoy this movie would be the young because of its message to tell little kids not to do what the actual Hurricane did."
4,Critics killed what was a good movie with possibilties,"This was a great movie, the ""Critics"" actually killed this movie and made a lot of people not go to see it. The Barsoom series were favorites of mine as a kid and I just re-read them prior to this movie coming out. Trying to seriously put a book (or series of books) into film is a very hard task, so the leeway taken with the original story has to be accepted. But the story itself was quite good and the effects were worth the huge amount of money they spent on them. What a shame that the reviews from the critics were so dismal. I have learned that if the critics say it was bad, I go see it first, because I am the average person looking for entertainment value, not the critic looking for some redeeming social value and underlying social commentary. Critics for the most part are MORONS....."
1,"Don't ever buy K-Tel stuff, it's never the original artists!","I am not writing this because I work or represent a competitor of K-Tel, I'm just writing this because I've spent too much money on their albums that were advertised as being the original tracks from the original artists and found out later I wasted my money. NONE of the albums I've found on Amazon.com with the K-Tel logo on them have the original artists performances of the songs. None. They must be making a lot of money ripping people off."
2,Room for improvement on many levels!,"First of all, the information is outdated, and I think its important for recruiters to have the most up-to-date information. Additionally, there are grammatical and spelling errors throughout the book, at minimum one per chapter!!!This is the biggest problem with it. For example, in Chapter 8 ""External Recruitment,"" it gives a list and writes out ""first, second..."" and does ""third"" twice. Words are used in the wrong context at times, causing additional confusion to the reader. And the biggest oozy of them all is the statistical error in Chapter 7 ""Measures"" - it gives an example of standardized testing comparisons, and does the problem incorrectly!!! Which led to me having to go back to my Statistics book to review the concept since I couldn't trust the book!Who edits these books anyways?"
5,"Good story, great acting.",I always enjoyed reading the Miss Marple stories and I feel that Miss Hickson portrayed her perfectly. It is a good story and good acting by all the cast.
4,Seeing Stars,"Edwin Howard's ""Seeing Stars"" enables one to pick a favorite star celebrity and to discover what it's really like to have a one-on-one conversation with them. From the silent stars (Lillian Gish) to Martin Sheen (West Wing) and all the others in between, Edwin gets us up close to the star.For example, I learned how John Grisham deals with unexpected celebrity; John Wayne's political views and his thoughts on ballet (yes, ballet!) Howard doesn't mince words, he tells of his interviews with the stars in a ""what you see is what you get"" kind of manner. He has learned how to get close to famous people and earn their trust but as veteran newspaperman his writing rings true."
1,I hate this cd,"I can't stand listening to this cd. Think of the potential, and they released this. If they don't want to make ""innovative"" material anymore or use synths, I say quit! Leave the legacy intact!"
3,Not bad at all for the price,"Knock on wood, it's been 5 months and this vacuum is still working. Unlike the last vacuum (a hoover windtunnel) that I paid $350 for, that only last a year until it blew out and would cost $250 to replace. Anyway, this vacuum is very light and sucks up very well in my opinion. We have a LOT of cat hair and it works great. This machine is a bit loud, but what vacuum isnt'? I had a kirby that was pretty loud and weighed about 10 times more than this one. This vacuum is well worth the money."
3,These are ok,I bought these after I read a lot of hype on the internet. But for the price all I would say is these are ok.
2,Don't be fooled by the cartoons or Clint Eastwood,"Do not be fooled like I was. When I saw the video of Clint Eastwood for the first time, I thought to myself WOW. I immediately picked up the record, and was very disappointed to say the least. I read a few online reviews of this record earlier (some good, many bad) and then decided to buy it. If for nothing else than the song Clint Eastwood.Well, I put it into my player and started to play the first few tracks. Hmmm, OK, let's skip one, another one...wait where is Clint Eastwood. Ah, finally, Track 5, Clint Eastwood. Good song, after that...let's skip this one too, not my music. At the end of Track 11 I think to myself ""What the hell?"" This is getting worse by the minute...I don't know, some people might like rap-funk hybrids like this. It is not me.Go listen to the entire record before you purchase. Then you will decide whether it is worth it. My copy is on eBay however. Ohhh, 2 stars were given for the cartoon characters. They are damn cool...True."
2,NOT univeral,"The build quality seems fine, however this mount is not universal. I have an Epson 8700 UB projector and this mount is not even close to being compatible. Bummer."
4,CAKED AND ALED,"Cakes are what aled me, as now ale is what cakes my memory like mud, dry and pale in the looking-glass that's half-full and looking back to see if anyone's looking back to look me full in the face. Whilst this is occurring, the book's pages turn back to their humble beginnings. They're shy (that is to say, discreet, that is to say, English) and poor (that is to say, not well-to-do, that is to say, not American) and make ends meet up with each other inevitably, by design, as the author's hand is the mirror-image of mine. We write trogether--matching sentence for sentence, word for word, letter for letter--pausing every now and then to look back over our shoulders to see if anyone's looking at us--a reader, perhaps, or maybe even two, who look just like each other and just like us, or I presume they do. I can't tell for certain as their heads are turned away from us, turned over their shoulders, looking back, at you[underlined}. Views are full of such views."
1,Total disappointment!!,"Suprisingly dull, completely unsatisfactory! I really wish I had saved my money and my time!"
3,Beautiful people indeed,"I never saw so many gorgeous ""lesbians"" in my lifetime. There is not an unattractive one in the whole lot. Okay, this is a TV show so I'll pretend I'm okay with the beauty factor. The show was well-made, very pleasing to the eye for the most part and I enjoyed seeing the seedier neighborhoods of LA. On the other hand, both Jenny and Marina (especially Jenny though) got on my nerves quite a bit and I wanted to slap Tina around frequently. I agree with the reviewer who said Pam Grier's talents were wasted. Jennifer Beals plays an annoying character (Bette) but it is mostly realistic and she is so beautiful you want to watch her all day long. Dana and Alice are type-cast as providing the lighter side and the comic relief. As for Shane, I am not quite sure what to think. All in all, it had me sitting in front of the TV for a long time so it's worth giving a try."
3,"Polite, neat and controlled, if that's what you want.","These guys make high-quality music. Beautiful sounds, clever chords, trenchant lyrics. Fabulous recording quality as ever.When I'm in the mood for polite, neat, perfectly-assembled music - and don't forget that highly repetitive toe-tappin' backbeat - I'll listen to 'Everything Must Go' again. Maybe around October."
5,Brilliant,Brilliant RPG of the dark future. There is nothing as exiting as making your cyberpunk charecter come to life in the nitty-gritty world of Night City anno 2020
1,Just Adding My One Star,"Don't waste your time or your money. If you want to read something, read the rest of the reviews. I wish I had."
5,fossiling in florida,"Having canoed MANY times down the Peace River in Arcadia, FL over the last 20+ years - and knowing nothing re fossiling there - saw a newspaper article on the fossiling and couldn't wait to get back. Took our almost 9 year old son (whom we have now nicknamed ""the fossil pro""), we had a ball! Then we heard about Mark Renz, and will be booking with him the next trip. Also, have a scout trip planned just from the collection our guy found there. Ordered the book for a surprise for third grade graduation next week. He's hooked, as are we!! Brian's Mom and Dad"
3,Honest review,"Well, JP3 is a decent flick. First time I saw it I was completely blown away. The second time however it wasn't that great. Still the action sequences are amazing. ILM really outdid themselves on the dino effects. But the comic relief starts to wear thin already the second time round, and well, the story isn't that great. It works though, just don't pay too much time to details. Sam Neill is good, as is Bill Macy (as always, one of my favorite actors). So, the best thing to do is rent this, and decide for yourself whether to buy this or not. I don't know about the DVD extras, guess you'll need to find that out for yourself.All in all JP3 is a fun movie, but don't expect mindboggling plots or something."
1,THE WORST MOVIE SEEN IN MY LIFE,"GENTLEMEN, PLEASE SI ERES AMANTE DE LOS SUPER HEROES Let me tell you that this is the WORST movie you seen in my life is HORRIBLE! HISTORY has nothing interesting, SUPER ABURRIDO NOT SPENDING YOUR MONEY ON THIS MOVIE SO BAD, DO NOT spend money on IT"
1,A reasonably intelligent human,"Is there a rating lower than 1 star? This monitor had an attractive price.... and that's about all. After 2 years, this object no longer works and Sylvania is of no help. It costs more to fix it, than to buy a new monitor -- another brand, please!"
4,Rotisserie,Just got the 3199R Countertop 1.1 Cft Convection Oven with Rotisserie. Tried to Rotissiere a whole chicken. 5lb chicken is too big. The Rotissiere has trouble turning. Will go to Convection Bake. Next time I will buy a smaller chicken.Reccomendation: Beef up the Rotisserie motor and connection.
5,USS Poopship Destroyer,"I doubt that this album would sway anyone whom previously disliked them but for those people that scoop anything these guys put out, it's pretty damn cool. Hopefully Dean and Gene will put out a CD with all new material soon but in meantime I'll be paintin' the town brown."
1,incredibly overrated,"Expensive - Only lasted one year - Fell over a lot - Never buying this brand againNot that I can name a better brand, but ever other fan that I've had costed less and lasted longer ( I can't remember having a fan just break )What a disappointment!"
4,"Short, but funny it's Cinerella with a twist","I really liked the twist in this book because, I think, there are too many Cinderella stories now days. To give the book a twist made it more interesting, not to mention more fun, to read. You couldn't predict as much. Even more than the twist was the humor. When Cinderellis couldn't take his helmet off to know what the princess was saying I laughed really hard. The only thing I didn't like about this book was how short it was. Levine could have gone on another ten chapters, yet she didn't."
3,A Good Book,"I've read this book some time ago and I thought that it's a good book about how people rely on their faith after what happened at Columbine.However, I'm very skepticial that there were any ""matyrs"" at Columbine, and that I don't think that any Christians were specificially targeted(including Rachel and Cassie)."
3,Okay for the time being,"I used to listen to this album a lot in the mid 90s when it first came out. Some songs like ""My Night To Howl"" and ""1800 Used To Be"" were fun at the time but now they just sound silly. I literally LOL when I listened to MNTH 16 years later. Lorrie Morgan's a great singer no doubt, but War Paint is a reflection of the country pop era and the steps Nashville was taking to imitate pop (the Madonna like cover, pop-rock flair and overly dramatic musical arrangements). Some songs are more straight ahead or contemporary country like ""If You Came Back From Heaven"" and ""A Good Year For The Roses"". It's a mixed bag and I think that the album lacks consistency because it's trying to be too many things all at once.I don't think that this is a bad album, but it isn't Lorrie's best either. Vocally she's right on as usual and that's why I gave her a 3 star rating because the album's respectable."
3,Interesting autobiography,"In this autobiography, James ""Bo"" Gritz writesof his career in Special Forces during the 1960sand 1970s, his private searches for POW's insoutheast Asia during the 1980s, and hissubsequent charges of government coverup ofthe POW issue. As a result of the latter, andof his discovery of CIA involvement in thesoutheast Asian drug trade, he broke withthe conservative Special Operations circlesand formed alliances with dissident groupson both ends of the political spectrum. Gritzalso touches on many other alleged conspiracies here.This book is a must for anyone researchingsuch 1980s scandals as Iran-Contra as well as thePOW-MIA controversy and CIA drug involvement.However, the book is long-winded, and worse,Gritz has made some truly unsavory political allianceswith racist far-right figures - somethingsure to diminish his credibility in many circles."
5,Loved it!,"Great read, a little melodramatic, but realistic nonetheless. Reminds me of Fate is the Hunter."
2,"Wayward then, wayward now.","This is a self-serving story written by a egotistical, ill-disciplined, manipulative, spoilt bully, out of touch with reality and with no empathy or sympathy - except for himself. And no credible evidence of remorse."
3,GT3,"I must say the graphics and sound are excellent, they are second to none. The problem is with the lack of cars, this game is on a DVD and a DVD has 9 times the storage of a CD yet Gran Turisimo 2 has at least 300 cars to choose from. You can tell this game has been rushed to cash in on PS2 new product poularity. This game could have been so much better.SO overall good graphics, sound lack of depth. Grand Turisimo 2 is still the king."
3,Why? Why? Why?,"WHY doesn't the album have OFFSPRING on it? OR better yet (and probably the only reason I wanted the soundtrack!) - Ace Frehleys (KISS), ""New York Groove"" (Most excellent oldie but goodie tune!)? Gee - I thought forsure these two would at least be on it, with NYG being No.1 !"
2,BE CAREFUL WITH THIS,IF YOUR DOG EARS AARE EVEN SLIGHTLY SENTSATIVE THEN YOU MIGHT WANT TO YOU IT . THE CHEMICALS CAN BE STRONG AND CAUSE PAIN AND ITCHING
5,Wonderful,This book is just wonderful :)I had it only 24 hours but I know it is the best written creative book I have so far.I sculpt with polymer clay and new ideas are always welcome and I truly did find some really good ideas.SUPER!!!
5,Hard rock with an R & B flavored edge!!,"Get ready to get your blood pumping! Play your favorite air guitar. If the cat is near by, make sure it's butt is in the air. This band should have made it and it is a shame they are not still together."
4,Very well written experience that is truely touching.,"This is the true story of a sailing family, shipwrecked in Alaska, in unsurvivable conditions, that seemed to get worse at every turn. Elmo Wortman does an excellent job of putting this experience to paper. He makes you feel what he (as well as his children) are going thru. A truely miracleous event that tugs at one's heart-strings, makes you mad, brings you to tears, and certainly won't leave you unaffected once you've read it.(This review has my CORRECT email address)"
1,Not vornado filters,"These are not Vornado filters. They do not fit correctly in my humidifier, and have a nasty chemical smell that I would be afraid to breathe in given my asthma."
2,not to impressed,This is really primitive. A German DJ recommended this artist to me so I went for the best of to start with and cant say Im gunna go much further than that. Its not bad but it really isnt bass music like Bass Mekanik or Beat Dominator. I think those guys have lifted the expectation beyond the originators of the bass music genre for me.
3,"It's ok, but the technical specifications? They say WHAT?",I've had one of these for years and it's ok for home use. But I glanced at the technical specs here and... What?Technical DetailsOptions: 21 Compartment literature sortThick polished aluminum for even heatingOven safe to 350 FNonstick coated - easy cleanup!Dishwasher safeLifetime Limited Warranty
3,Too long but interesting,"""In Cold Blood"" by Truman Capote is in fact a good book, but it was also way too long for the content that it contained. Capote seemed to explore each character to their core, not letting you miss a beat of their life. This either made me want to fall asleep or throw the book out the window because it was so boring at parts. Exposing the character's life is a necessity to a book, but Capote took the description way too far. On a positive note, the book was very interesting at times. You got to know the characters well and you began to feel sorry or hateful toward them. The book covered the Clutter case very well and it was very detailed. I gave this book 3 stars because even though it was a good book, the length and too developed characters made it a boring read at times."
2,Unworthy of Thirkell,I love the Thirkell books but this one is an aberration. It's trite and obvious. The characters are not particularly interesting. It's as if the author decided to try something different -- and it didn't work. Skip this one and read her other works.
4,Great digital camera for beginners,"I've owned my Polaroid 320 for about 6 months now and enjoyed it. I used it mainly for my online auctions. Most of the pictures were fair-good but after figuring out where to take the pictures(because of no flash) and how to use the software my pictures got somewhat better.It's a great camera to buy but I would advise learning about the software and experimenting with the camera before ""officially"" using it. Unfortunately because this camera is not USB ""compliant"" I am unable to use it with my new computer."
4,"Good Selections, For the Most Part","Lacks a lot of the filler that plagued the earlier volumes, and does include some actual hits (""Bette Davis Eyes,"" ""Just the Two of Us,"" ""Living Inside Myself,"" and ""Sweetheart""), but more could have been done to tighten up this CD. All original versions."
3,"""that's good, Bad""","My favorite line from this lackluster film, uttered by Jean Craddock, Mad Morris' love interest, well played by Maggie Gyllenhal. Bad Morris, a washed up country singer trying to make a come back is his own worst enemy. When he finally ""hits rock bottom"" and comes to terms with his alcoholism and rover past, it is ""good"", but just a bit too late. Most of the movie portrayed Bad Morris (Jeff Bridges) as an unsavory character--sweaty, profane, chain-smoking and dead drunk; yet there was definitely a spark of humanity in him, which comes to the fore when he becomes interested in the sweet reporter, Jean. I found this film to be quite slow and did not enjoy the character Bad Morris at all, really until the end. The ending wasn't all that bad, and I enjoyed some of the music, especially when he writes some new songs near the end, but overall I have to give the movie a C+."
4,Quite a surprisingly good album,"When stations here in Boston began (for a very short while) playing ""Say What You Want,"" I thought it was from one of those typical young black female R&B singers who goes by their first name and would soon fade into the musical background. I ventured out to buy the CD, only to be hideously surprised that it was a Scottish band fronted by a very white woman. The lead vocals have great emotion and inflection, and the music can be quite seductive at times. The little musical interludes are quite vexing, but the album as a whole is very good. ""Black Eyed Boy"", while an obvious generic Motown cover, is great for blasting the stereo and dancing with attitude. ""Say What You Want"" is an incredibly jazzy, silky smooth song that almost forces you to bob your head and point your fingers. The rest of the collection of songs are quite good...not excellent...but definitely worthy of a listen or two."
5,The Blues Never Made Me So Happy,"I'm 33 years old, and was a huge Zep fan from my mid teens to mid 20s. Buying this DVD set brings it all back into focus for me now and reminds me why Zepplin -- hands down -- was the greatest blues rock band ever created.Listening and watching what they threw down in the late 60s and 70s in 2003 makes you realize just how devoid of power and passion the music industry in general is today. Today's music is marketing. Zeppelin flies in the face of that -- they were all about the music and playing live. I wish I could have been at one of these shows -- the DVD comes damn close to making you feel like you were there.I can only hope that the DVD set and the 3CD live package will start another blues/rock groundswell that refocuses the music buying public's attention on the music -- not the marketing."
5,A Christmas Classic,"Wow, this movie is one of all my favorites classics that I love. I know that the story is corny, the seats look like paper mache, but I am 50 years old and I still love this move, can sing all the songs and almost quote the movie word for word. The cast is unknown except of Rosanno Brazzi. But if you have never seen this movie, please get it. ..."
2,The Strokes really stroke one.,"After all the hype I expected to hear something amazing and magical. Unfortunately, this one fell a tad short. Quite possibly because of it's hype and the unfair label that has been put on them as ""The saviors of rock and roll"". Not even close, but if it had been just another album put out without so much expectations then it would've been a great consistent rocker. Although the lo-fi sound gets a little annoying. ""Last night"" is the best song on the album. A catchy tune with a classic rock and roll sound."
4,Where's the director's commentary?,"Just as an FYI, the case for this DVD refers to a separate track with the director's commentary, but the commentary is a no-show. Thus, only 4 stars instead of 5 for a great movie, but sub-par DVD."
4,Teac R-H500 Nifty little deck,"Just what I was looking for. Seems these are hard to buy. Works good! I would like to find the CD deck to go along with it. Can't say how it will hold up as I really don't use it that much, but I do like the smaller size but nice features."
3,racket without a cover,It is a fine racket but it is the first time I have been sold a racket without a cover ( for protection )
2,Way Over Priced,I bought this book for close to $43.74 ($39.74 + $3.99 shipping)and when it arrived it was marked $19.99 on the cover.Very annoyed!!!Will not be so quick to order again>
2,"OK book, but just download it online","This book is OK for those people who love to nitpick language, typically Standard Received English. In my neck of the words pidgin English usually works, along with pidgin Mandarin and Mongolian.But you can get this book at Language Log on-line, so why bother buying it? I guess to keep English majors gainfully employed."
2,Not too bad...,"It's got the standard blender recipes inside, written by a nutritionist. Look elsewhere for more information and more choices for your little ones."
2,Very poor OEM case,Purchased the V60t and ordered the case because Amazon.com did not have anything else(i.e.Body Glove). Motorola put very little thought into this case for such a great phone. Offers some protection but not for the front Caller I.D. screen area. The belt clip drops the rating on this case. Nothing beats the swivel clip for easy removal and the design ruins the look of the phone. Did find a cellular dealer here in Nassau that had both Body Glove and sb wireless... cases that are much better and more attractive. If you cannot find any other case to protect your phone this will do but be prepared for a fight with the belt clip when you get a call.
3,Can't rate yet- need to pick up a USB cable!,"I received this as a gift, and I was all excited and ready to hook it up. I was following the instructions step by step until I got to the part where it says to connect the USB cable. That would be the USB cable that ISN'T included with the printer. No where on the box, on Epson's website, or in the manual does it mention that you need to provide the USB cable yourself. The manual reads like it should be there. I was frantically looking in the box for something I missed, only to realize that I wasn't mising anything. Epson was just too cheap to include a (...)cable that probably wouldn't cost them nearly that much to include. But it looks cool, so I'll be dragging my butt to Radio Shack tomorrow for the cable. (It also doesn't tell you what kind of USB cable you need. You're supposed to be psychic I guess.)"
5,Amazing,"My license plate reads, ""RWATERS"" because of the endless supply of geniune perfection provided by Roger Waters. Brilliant were his 1999 and 2000 tours, as his concerts stand out as some of the best experiences of my life. The sound quality on ""In the Flesh"" is absolutely phenomenal. Every song is inspirational and uplifting. THIS is the way Roger wanted it to be. [On a darker note, it appears that the editors of Rolling Stone have a serious case of genius envy. Maybe if Roger was wearing the latest in fashion (a-la-Backstreet Boys) would RS have given ""In the Flesh"" a halfway decent review.] Magnificent!"
2,Just A Joke!,"What happened? It seems like Hetfield et co. abandoned the bona fide Metallica sound after the boxed money-maker of ""LIVE SHEE-IT"". Clearly the ""LOAD"" brothers did not make the grade.As for ""St. Anger"", it looks like Hetfield was released from rehab and noticed that Linkin Park seemed to be the sound of the day (carpe diem THAT, baby!) and decided to jump on a bandwagon. So what you've got is, you've got these elder statesmen of heavy rock making fools of themselves by emulating musicians who were still riding BigWheels when ""Kill Em All"" first made the scene.If this is the direction in which they're headed, Metallica should have the stones to bow out gracefully like Mustaine did."
3,Confused,"Not for sure what I did wrong, but I purchased 800 points thinking this would buy my son some time on xbox live and thought it would alleviate me from having to enter my credit card onto his xbox live. Well, I received the online code, my son entered it on his xbox and it still asked for a credit card # to verify. I have no clue what I just did. I feel like I've been charged for the 800 points and now I'm thinking Xbox has just charged me for something."
2,legs can't be secured,"The product is made well except for one fatal flaw. The legs telescope but won't stay out. Other telescoping items can be turned to secure them. These legs collapse with any movement or in certain positions. I'm trying to think of a way to make them not slip closed so easily, such as an anti-WD40 spray. Maybe just some dirt and scratching?Seriously, I would love it fine if I could get a feeling of security once positioned."
5,Chicken Soup For the Funny Bone,"This is a short and sweet little book that can be read in just a few minutes, but every minute will be filled with fun! In cleverly silly rhymes Maurice Sendak takes us through the twelve months and thoroughly entertains us with his characteristic illustrations featuring the little dark-haired boy we've come to know in some of his other stories. The non-sensical inclusion of ""chicken soup with rice"" in all of the rhymes makes the months all the more memorable and easy for kids to recite, a great little device. The paperback edition is very affordable but I suspect you'll love this one so much that you'll want the hardcover in your library."
5,Jasper's Day,"This story is a wonderful story about preparing to say good-bye to the family pet. Having just lost a pet of my own, I cried the whole time through, and I wish I had spent my last day with her as meaningfully as the family in the story. I would recommend this to any family with an older or sick pet."
3,A book for Scarpetta fans,"I recently reread the Scarpetta series, after reading this one. I think *Cruel and Unusual* is the best of the lot. While others complain about Scarpetta's emotional depths in BN, I didn't mind that, although I found the book picked up speed in the second half. I've become more aware that Cornwell can be a sloppy writer - introducing references that are erroneous intrinsically or make no sense, and this has been more marked as the series progressed. Black Notice is more tightly written than previous works. I would like to see a shift in protagonist from Kay to Lucy, as an interesting evoluton in this series. Cornwell still has the gift of smooth writing"
2,Disappointing,"I'm a big Doors fan & collector and was very disappointed with this documentary. In fact, there was very little I liked about it, other than perhaps the nice quality of the HWY clips and some others. There's virtually nothing new in the ""rare"" clips used, which the director was hyped as given ""access to the Doors archives"".The narrative was laughable at times and missed so much. As mentioned in another review, there were so many other people that should have interviewed for this film, who could have offered some real insight into the band and their activities at the time.Rating: 2/5"
2,LOTS of effort!,"Do not try the cross stitch that requires two needles! After an hour and 15 minutes I was only 1/3 of the way done. At that point I was at the first ""spoke"". I could not make it look right and gave up. If your steering wheel has wide spokes I don't think the average adult male has a chance. I used to use this product years (25?) ago and was generally satified with the results, but I sure could not make it work with a modern steering wheel."
3,Fast Shipping and Good Product,"This product arrived in three days after my order. That's fast considering that I live in Hawaii. It is good for holding the quarters tightly, you just need to press it hard so it won't fall off quickly."
4,If you like murder mysteries this book is for you,"This book is a really good book, I recommend this book to anybody who at least likes reading little bit, especially if you like to read about brama and murder.Reading is not one of my strong points but this book was very easy to understand. I really liked the book because it kept me in suspense, and I never knew what to expect. Like in the begining of the book, I could not figure out why Michael Starkwedder was trying to help out Laura Warwick(the killer)so much.Although the book was like trying to put a puzzle together the whole time it was very interesting and I really liked it."
1,Quit your crying and move to a third world country!,All I have to say to the author of 'Prozac Nation' and the main character in the movie is to quit your crying and move to a third world country! Then we will see how sorry you feel for yourself. You will see some in people in real pain and suffering. Then we will see if your life is as bad as you think.
4,Works for me.,I would definitely recommend this book for ASP beginners. The progression through topics was logical for the most part and the level of detail will get you started developing simple prototype and basic applications. It lays enough of a foundation to understand how ASP pages work allowing you to progress without any other assistance other than using the standard on-line references shipped with ASP development software like Interdev. There are obvious errors that present hurdles throughout the book but they are only as high as your problem solving skills are low.
1,"Mistitled- Should read ""My Tirade Against Animal Righters","If you are looking for fun facts about camels, horses, cats, dogs,etc and their supposed early histories, get another book. The animals themselves are hardly mentioned. This is just one long bitter argument about why he is right and others are wrong. I'm not a supporter of either side in this argument. I wanted an expanded section of the chapter of animal domesticatin in Gun Germs and Steel, but that isnt what I got"
4,A Blast from the past!!!,If you remember tetris as a little kid then you will still get the thrill of the stack....
1,Waste Of Time To Read This Book,I have been waiting for this book for so long to see what hapens to Harry. When I got this book my mom and I. We thought this book was stupid. We only got to page 90 and stoped. We had to ask a family member how it ended. I told some of my other famliy members the J.K. Rowing can wirte a craby book like this one and still make over a millon dollars. All this book is about is how Harry is so loney. Take it from me do not read this book!!
2,brain dead tv,"brain dead tv for the brain dead masses, brain dead tv for the brain dead massses, not much to say i guess"
2,Ghost In The Shell,"I bought this movie expecting awesome animation, great action scenes, and the coolness of anime characters. This was a major letdown. The plot is interesting, but the horrendous English dubbing spoiled the movie for me."
4,Great resource for students or teachers.,"The whole Cambridge series is very valuable. It offers helpful footnotes without cluttering the page, and actually indicates within the text when a footnote will appear. Text appears on right-hand side, and left-hand page offers thoughtful questions and activities to spur engagement, including comprehension and analysis, get-out-of-your-seats and act, and staging/directorial decision-making, and thematic extensions."
2,unintentional (?) camp,"Because I feel technical/craft deficiencies sink this film, I'm not going to commment on the plot, except to say that the several storylines were not very well integrated. Some bits and pieces of this movie made me wonder what the actors could have achieved with better direction and a better script, but far too often their emotions changed so dramatically and unrealistically within a scene that is was imposible to take them seriously. The music was sappy and distracting, playing so heavily over some scenes as to make the dialogue difficult to understand. It was refreshing to see ""real"" looking actors but what they were given to say was many times laugh-out-loud silly and trite. Not the worst movie I've seen, but one easily skipped."
3,"Good, but available on the Idol full-length disc!","The 2 songs here are great and this is a fine buy for Kelly and American Idol completists, but these same 2 songs are also available on the Idol full-length cd! Don't bother getting this if you are planning on getting the other cd!"
4,"Wonderful, thought-provoking readings","Spurgeon is the best! I never fail to find something to stir my heart in this book. I can't count the number of times the morning's entry has been just exactly what I needed to hear on that particular day. The readings are short, only about one page each, but rich and full of depth, providing insights that keep me thinking about my Lord and Savior throughout the day."
3,"Wonderfull scenarios, low driving realism","I bought this game because I loved Collin McRae Rally for PC. The scenarios are wonderfull, sometimes it seems like a movie, not CG. Unfortunatelly the driving miss realism. The car's damage simulation are fine but driving feels like the car is floating, it is very difficult to keep it on the road and light turns on the wheel makes the car slide like it was over ice. Compared to Forza Motorsport, Forza is much better in the driving simulation, even without a racing wheel controller you can feel more control over the car. I'd give it 10 for the graphics and car damage simulation but only 5 for the driving simulation."
5,The best ever!,Literally the best series I've read in a long time....the characters stay with you long after you are done reading. I loved this series. Please read - it will touch you too!
2,Stick with Crayola,"I bought these for my almost-2 year old son, as we take crayons and a drawing pad with us whenever we go to restaurants. I have soem crayola crayons, which are great, but the cardboard box they come in gets ripped easily, and then the crayons start getting lost. I bought these because they come in a travel case, which I thought would help with the lost crayons issue.Pros would be: good color selection, nice and chunky for small hands.Cons vastly outweigh the pros, and are that the colours are very weak, some barely show up on paper at all (orange, light blue for example) and the so-called ""travel case"" is made of the flimsiest plastic imaginable, more like the stuff that cheap blister packs are made of. I don't expect the ""travel case"" will last any longer than the crayola cardboard.This was a waste of money, and I would recommend buying Crayola crayons, and putting them in a sturdy tin case instead."
2,Not much information here.,"The cover claims ""A Practical Guide to Photographing the Night Sky"". The book is essentially a vehicle for displaying the authors' remarkable photographs. The discussion on equipment and methodology is shallow and incomplete."
1,THIS is supposed to be funny?,"This was one of the most perverse, depressing books I have ever read. I had an advanced reader's copy of this book and read it February 2002; I was shocked to see it actually published and in demand. I would not recommend it to anyone sensitive to childhood abuse, suicide or child molestation. To me these are serious issues and are nowhere near the realm of ""hilarious."""
4,Great DVD!,Can't go wrong with Sesame Street! Bought 4 for our various nephews & nieces and they love it!
1,Not a book for serious operators,"Given the impressive records of the authors I would have thought they'd be able to put together a much more comprehensive book, which btw I wouldn't have minded paying a lot more for - provided it had current info and not stuff from a 1970's SF manual. This contains very basic information written over a weekend with information that could have been plucked from the web with a few google searches. Not a book for serious operators."
4,Good book but bit of a drag,Plot is excellent but the book is too long and a bit boring at a few places.
1,It didnt help me,After reading the reviews I thought that I would give it a try this book didnt help me at all to me its not well put together.
1,"Wrong part again, I wish these company's would inclide better informatiom, hope I can get my money back...","Wrong part again, I wish these company's would inclide better informatiom, hope I can get my money back...Why is it so difficult to get the right part?"
5,"slow going, but this book is a revelation","This book is unique in its depth, scope, and humility. I have been interested in these themes for a while, and I think people of any faith will appreciate the painstaking care that has been taken to integrate knowledge/evidence from experiment, logic, and experience.Definitely worth it, and it's surprising it isn't more popular. I think it's probably going to take a while for these ideas to seep into the broader public discourse."
4,"So far, so good","The product came in a very timely manner. Thus far, they are working great. Haven't had them long enough to speak to their longevity, however."
4,WOnderful,I put my ipad on it and watch movie on my bad .how nice .I love it very much .if you are bed ipad playier you should have one
2,The Decline Continues,"I've been listening to these guys for ten years now and it's been painful to watch the slow death of a band. Darrell totally limits himself to feedback and distorted solos that pale in comparison to the earlier solos that made you stare at your stereo in amazement (i.e.- a new level). pantera's best moments have always been when darrell and vinnie plow through everything in their path. but on this album they never really open the songs up. it's like somebody told them ""you can't go five seconds without having vocals. the only improvement is phil, who doesn't make the cd uninintelligible and unlistenable by screaming endlessly like on TGSTK. As a whole, all the years off have done one thing, and that's put the other foot in the grave. Pantera's done."
3,So-so battery,"Delivery was in a timely fashion. I recharge every 3 to 4 days, which is an improvement over every other day that I was doing. I was hoping for the battery lasting closer to a week before recharging. It is a bargain for the price."
2,Cakey,"Very dry feeling, looks cakey. Made me look like I had wrinkles. HOWEVER, good coverage. But not exactly how described"
3,Broke 1st day!,"Though My Grandson liked the Gear set, I was disapointed with the plastic posts on the set! How can He enjoy exploring how gears work when the posts that hold gears break off so easily? Great idea but weak parts...."
5,Vandoren!,"I've yet to get a Vandoren product that wasn't any good, this cork grease is no different. Vandoren all the way!"
2,"Great compilation, but...","I have to say the production quality is terrible. My high school mixed tapes were cleaner and higher fidelity than this album. During the song Lost In Motion - one of the more tranquil, moody tracks - there's a HUGE pop that totally ruins the mood of the song. You'd think if you were going to spend the time and money producing an album, you'd either get better vinyl, or fix the screw-ups in post. And I'm not just talking dust on a record, this is a huge pop like somebody put a fork to the record and plugged it into a high voltage outlet. Not what I expect from a professionally produced trance CD.Other than that, great compilation."
3,average and predictable,"This is just an ok movie. It won't make my top ten list of Bollywood films. It has some good things- the sets are opulent, the clothes are gorgeous, the acting was very good. I got it because I have become a fan of Ashryan Khan and he doesn't disappoint.The dancing is an old fashion style, not the hip hop style dancing in most modern holly films. To me they are mostly borng ad are the songs. I also thought the plot is predictable, the emotions are overwrought and everything is melodramatic.If you want a better movie see Billu."
3,Good for emergencies,"I bought this tank on a whim when I decided to rescue a sad, dying red betta from Wal-Mart. It was cheap and it worked for a quick fix. However, it is too small for a betta to live comfortably. This tank is like a studio apartment for a betta - it will work, but it's not ideal. My betta recouped from being neglected by Wal-Mart, I was able to return home from college and place him in a bigger tank (2.5 gallon).Like I said, this tank should be for fry and for emergencies in case a larger tank has an issue. It shouldn't be a main tank for a betta. Keep that in mind when purchasing a tank - the bigger the better. Always."
5,Best Marketing Mash Up yet.,"Peter Fisk is a great information aggregator and knows how to separate the good stuff from the fluff.With 15 years of Marketing and Product Management experience under my belly I find this collection of tools and insights refreshing, timely and relevant.Buy it and keep it!Oliver Fritschcendesic.comvocationlab.comdenkzeuge.de"
5,A wonderful book,I found this book both enlightening and informative. I had no knowledge of this institution and had only heard of Mr. Booker T. Washington in my history class some 46 years ago. Easy reading.
2,"Great curls, but...","I was very excited to get this iron. I tried it out and it definitely makes some nice curls, but after just one use the purple coating on the barrel as well as on and underneath the clip was already coming off. I could see the bare metal. I'd probably try a hot tools iron again but not this one specifically."
2,"cute, but cord way too long","These are cute and comfortable, but the cord is way longer than it needs to be to reach any gizmo you're holding, sitting next to, or have in your pocket. The cord's so long I've accidentally kneeled on it and pulled the earbuds straight out of my ears. So that's not cool.The other problem is that if you jiggle or twist the jack, the sound cuts in and out and gets all fuzzy. The earbuds that came with my mp3 player didn't do that."
1,Avoid this Product,"This unit is made of extremely cheap, low-grade plastic. Less than two weeks out of the box, one of the fans began to grind and make noise periodically. The upside was that Targus agreed to replace the unit; the downside was that they wanted five weeks to do it. Five weeks! What am I supposed to do in the meantime?This is the first product of its type that I have owned, but I was pretty shocked, given its price, at how flimsy it was when I took it out of the box. Since I purchased it, the price has dropped drastically (at least temporarily), but knowing what I know now, I wouldn't buy it even at the reduced price. It is just a mickey mouse device."
2,Scent is a Bummer,"This lotion works amazingly, but I can't use it because the scent is SO overpowering. Gives me an instant headache. Throwing it out because I can't use it. I've tried several times, but I can't deal with the headache. :("
4,Just the book I wanted!,Hatha Yoga IllustratedGreat book and shows all the poses in detail and benefits from each pose. Great book for beginners like myself.A must if you are taking Yoga!
4,great,they did what they are suppose to do and the price was right. And I have a limited place to shop
1,Dull,"I purchased this book when it was first published. It was being hyped as the next ""DaVinci Code"". The author was making the morning TV rounds and I was excited to get started. However, I must say that this is one of the dullest books that I have read."
2,back decompression,I purchased this slant board to use only for back decompression but the top foam pads are too close to the board to hook the ankles and keep you on the board.
1,Another signature on the DRM petition,"These reviews are more like signatures on an anti-DRM petition, rather than judging the game, so they may not be entirely fair. However, EA needs to get the message that DRM is unacceptable and unfair. Like anything else in life, crooks will always find a way around safeguards. EA needs to learn their lesson. We, their customers, dedicated gamers, will not stand for this nonsense."
3,"calidad excelent, product deficient...!!!","This product can only be used to listen to the music of his Ipod, but does not play video. I bought for my home theater system to view the video on my iPod and take a one-touch all my digital content but do not achieve this with accessories. You may only be useful for earlier versions of the iPod classic. What if it succeeds is able to control the music from artists, most recently heard, albums, etc.. by remote control receiver harman kardon.I recommend that you only get if you just have iPod 5.5 or less, since I bought it thinking that all civil servant to my iPod classic and I failed to see the videos."
4,Great toaster,"I am very pleased with this toaster,not only is it great looking but it works great too.It has nice wide slots for bagels,and several settings for how brown you want your toast.I would buy another."
2,Not a Tom Petty Fan,"A lot of people told me that this was a great film, even if I wasn't a big Tom Petty fan. It is a long film, about 4 hours. There is a lot of old footage involved which can be interesting and I learned that Tom Petty led a miraculously lucky life. This film seems to try to gloss over his entire life, which I am sure as with almost everyone there is too much to talk about in four hours. I wish that they had concentrated more on the really interesting moments and left out half of what did make it into the film. There are a lot of breaks they just show concert footage for some of his songs.If you really like Tom Petty, this is made for you. If you are indifferent or dislike him, this won't change anything for you."
4,Vampire Love Story,"I really enjoy all of Stephanie Meyer's books in the Twilight Series. It is a fast paced book that explores the idea that vampires and wolves live among us. At the heart of the story, however, is a traditional love story between two people, which is what I enjoyed most about this series."
2,Crazy Lady,I didn't like the Crazy Lady book alot. It never really interested me. Although some parts at the end were good so I gave it 2 stars. My opinion changed alot about drinking. I know I will never get drunk now since I read the way Maxine acted when she was drunk.
4,Great Gift,This was a gift to my hubby who loves the song about a Hippo for Christmas. It was a hard song to find and it was a perfect gift.
1,Cliched Trail Ride,"After years of being a faithful Rogers fan, I am finally going to call it quits. It's hard to believe that Ms. Rogers wrote this book. The characters were flat in this one. The plot meandered everywhere. It was just another cliche-riddled trail ride. I can't recommend it. Better to go back and read the Steve and Ginny stories which are still wonderful to read!"
1,Oh Janet!,"I Love Janet Jackson! BUT, these past few years of releases have been disappointing for me. When I was reading all the hype over her new *20* CD I was stoked! I was hoping that she would put out a Fab new CD so I could break out all my Janet Cd's and have my own private party! It came out, I rushed to buy it and the first single *Call On Me*. I was in SHOCK! It was HORRIBLE! I was so disappointed. Now I'm looking forward to her brothers new CD!"
3,God Bless America!,"Great story but disappointing delivery. I nearly disposed of the book after the first few chapters: too much ""could only happen in the USofA"" for me. However, after about 100 pages the story begins and it gets interesting, the politics, corruption and downright foul play to get the railroad built are nearly as fascinating as the imagery of the real heros, the men who surveyed, designed and built the thing."
3,Doesn't age well,"I had just finished the UFO tv series and was pleasantly surprised how well that series had aged, so I decide to give Space 1999 a try. I remember loving this series as a child, but unfortunately on a second viewing it does not hold up well. Where to start. The packaging itself is nicely done. The transfer is ok, but looks washed out and grainy at times. The sound mixing is poor - alternating between blasting music and whispering dialog. And most surprising of all, the special effects, both visual and audio, seem worse than those in UFO, a much earlier series. The acting and characters seem flat and one dimensional and the plots just aren't compelling.That all said, if you're a fan of Gerry Anderson's work, then it is worth adding to your collection, otherwise I'd pass."
2,Incomplete,"The book tells the history of how the two brothers have used high credit risk customers to their advantage. They tell how they have been successful at ensuring prompt payment from these customers. Only problem is they are incomplete on telling you HOW they ensure prompt payment. Example: They state you can ask five simple questions to determine the credit risk of an individual, but never tell you the five questions. The book is in dire need of a grammar checker. The book is defintely focused on collecting from individuals."
5,Like Coltrane,My friend is in search of his interpretation of God. So I gave this cd to him to help him on his quest. I hope he finds what he is looking for. <3
5,Very helpful for getting started,I've started reading it and I believe it was a worthwhile purchase.
5,Hi. I'm Mat - door mat.,"Came in quick. Both receipients who they were purchased for loved it (both named Matt). Everyone who saw it got a kick out of it. Great, funny gift and good quality."
5,"Corning Ware 8pc Pop-Ins, Bake and Serve Set","Corning Ware, so well made, and microwaveable including the tops. Goes from the refrigerator to the Microwave. What a time saver and lack of dishes to wash."
1,album is terrible,I love Pink Floyd. I enjoyed everthing from Meddle to the Divison Bell. But i would have to say that this is the worst album i have ever heard. I listened to it once and then never touched it since. It is terrible. Everybody here gives it 4 stars so it looks like it is good. Is everybody scared to say something bad about pink floyd. Honestly this album is ridiculous.
3,Not for everyone,"The photography is beautiful. But understand that this book is asort of bio of emotions about growing up gay, not about building and decorating dollhouses."
1,hollywood trash,"nothing works here. the acting is poor, the attempts at creating atmosphere are hamstrung by the copious addition of cheese, its too scary for kids and too stupid for adults. I had to stop watching after 25 minutes it was so painful."
1,Cheap Microphone,Watch out. The reviews that I had read before buying this product claimed that it came with a Plantronics DSP-300 stereo headset microphone but when I recieved it a cheap Andrea NC-61 was included. I paid the extra money believing I would recieve a quality microphone. For this reason alone I gave it a one star rating. I returned the product for a refund.
1,What a total nightmare,"Don't know what I missed listening to this concert.I love Opera but this is a nightmare of singing ,if you can call that singing,there are very few moments that are ""Great"".Dessay is a total mess ,she screamed and shrieked her way through the aria,even Damrau is in poor voice,usually a singer I admire.The whole lot are not worth the price of the DVD.If you like great singing ,save you're money and buy the many ""Galas"" that are available ,skip this one.I bought the DVD on the recomandation of the three reviews,what a mistake,they are just like the audience in vienna,who would have given the artists an ovation,for being mostly terrible,yes there were a few arias sung OK but most of them had a hard time and sounded way past there prime.Will Domingo EVER stop singing?"
4,Great toy..but easily breakable!,"I bought this for my 2 year old son who loves our real washing machine. At first, I thought it was a nice toy. I really wasnt impressed with the size but the sounds were really life-like. Now a year later, it doesnt work anymore. The door broke off long ago and wouldnt stay on and now it doesnt even work at all. My son really enjoyed playing with it while it lasted but for a toddler it isnt very durable. My son liked carrying it around and for a 2 year old it is quite bulky so it would get dropped alot...wished they would have put a handle on the top. Overall, while it worked it was great..just wished it would have lasted longer than a year!"
1,If you get lucky!,I purchased this because we have a big fly problem in the summer.Well it works if you get lucky and the wires that run across do not pop out and the flies are big enough. Most times the flies just fly right inbetween the wires. Also I have had instances where you can clearly see the fly was zapped and the fly will fall to the ground only to fly away as soon as it hits the ground. The product was hated by everyone in my family and I am returning it!
1,Uh oh...,"I really loved this product. In fact, I have yet to find another scrub as good as this one. But, I just found out that Olay still tests their products on animals. I just think that there is no place for animal testing anymore. Imagine the pain the animals went through when this scrub was applied. So, I can't use this product, or ANY product from Olay until they change their policies. Too bad. Can anyone recommend a good scrub alternative?"
5,Blast from the Past,I was thrilled to find this peice of entertainment history available. I used to watch these movies years ago on Sunday afternoon television and jumped at the chance to purchase them on DVD.
2,Could be a great product if it worked,The first unit that I received was replaced by HP Technical Support because it froze and required a reset almost daily. My second unit turns itself on for a reminder and never shuts off causing the battery to completely drain and erase all of my information and settings. HP Tech Support attempted to blame 3rd party applications for my trouble but I haven't even installed any Microsoft software. I am hanging in there with high hopes for the new version of Pocket PC.
5,good buy,"Absolutely love it! It was my baby's first puzzle,she got it when she was 1 year, It was too complicated for her at that time. She mastered it when she was probably around 20 months. But now she is 2.5 years and loves all kinds of puzzles. Free time for me and hours of entertainment for her."
1,"Who writes this stuff, and why is it so popular?","What I learned from this episode:1. If you're having premarital sex, you're not a christian2. If you're a christian, you're ashamed of your natural sexual urges3. If you're a *good* christian, you don't have any sexual urges.4. No one masturbates. Ever.5. Abortions are unspeakable.6. Guidance counselors can refuse to give condoms to students (wtf??!)I sincerely hope there's more to this show than some messed up contradictory right wing religious propaganda. It's just the first episode... but I've seen a couple others and I think it's from the creators of 7th Heaven, so... Yeah.7th Heaven was the first show of my childhood that I recognized as bad writing. I even tried to like it because my friends did, but it was always just awkward and unrealistic dialog. Even when I was in elementary school."
3,Decent Compilation,"Where the hell is ""The Wanton Song""? I mean, this is one of their hardest rocking songs, off of Physical Graffiti. I also think ""Houses of the Holy"" should have been taken off, and instead, they should have had ""In My Time of Dying"". Track listings:1. The Song Remains the Same-8/102. No Quarter-7/103. Houses of the Holy-6/104. Trampled Underfoot-10/105. Kashmir-10/106. Ten Years Gone-4/107. Achilles Last Stand-9/108. Nobody's Fault But Mine-7/109. All My Love-8/1010. In the Evening-9/10"
3,Good reception but annoying alert tone.,"The unit receives signals well, maybe too well. During a storm event, the unit becomes annoying because of the frequent and loud alerts broadcast by the weather service. If there was just a tad bit more logic to the thing it would null the loud tone after the first time it gets your attention. The repeated loud tones which cannot be disabled without turning the radio off are just more than necessary. I'd recommend putting it under a pillow once you receive the first alert during a weather emergency. Otherwise you may wind up being tone deaf. There are many types of weather alert radios out there. I own two different brands myself. The other one doesn't even respond during an event as it's reception is so poor. At least this one will jilt you into action with it's very audible screech. Just get the ear plugs ready."
4,silver surfer,"I'm glad i went to London before seeing this film. I went on the Londen eye and was staying in that exact area so it would have creeped me out if i saw this film before going to london. Anyway, this second Fantastic 4 was good. I liked the silver surfer and Torche's new ability to trade powers with the other members. Dr. Doom is back and still evil. There were funny moments and lines and overall, this film was fantastic, from start to end. Jessica alba and chris evans were my fav. of the four heroes and of course the silver surfer was cool as sin."
1,"I couldn't finish ""Armor.""","""Armor"" is poorly written. Characters come and go, people do things for no apparent reason, you cannot bring yourself to give a hoot about...whatever the main character's name is.I read through the first part, which is sufficiently action-filled to cover up the shortcomings of the writing, then lost interest and moved on to something else.Read ""Ender's Game."" It's vastly better--it even stacks up well against non-sci-fi books."
3,A Most Read,"The author writes about how Christopher thinks, which interests the reader. He thinks like an adult at times, and in a split second he is thinking like a two-year-old. This character shows how everyday situations can be interpreted differently. Thoughts aren't always wrong, right, good or bad. Perceptions of events are important and always vary among individuals. I learned people have different perceptions of the same situations. I can't say I understand all behavior disorders but I can say the book made me more aware. I can at least show kindness and patience to all people. It's not everyday a book can be enjoyed for the story and appreciated as a learning experience. I'm able to appreciate thegrowth and change in my own life. I owe Christopher a big thank you."
1,Brainless fluff compared to the Queen's Bastard and sequel,"I was blown away with the very smart, deep game C.E. Murphy made of The Queen's Bastard and sequel but I've been incredibly disappointed in this, the Urban Shaman series. I read three and really wanted to like them because of the good characters, but the protagonist is just an accident waiting to happen. These books are nothing more than Ms. Murphy cashing in on the rage for alternate reality drivel. Frustratingly dumb fluff. A few authors do this genre very, very well but in this series, Ms. Murphy fails miserably."
4,Good all natural treats,My dogs love these treats. The only problems I've encountered with these are the left over powder at the bottom and the sizes are not uniform; many big pieces and many very small pieces (very minor problems). But they are all natural and don't upset my dogs stomachs.
3,Too Accademic,"I was looking for a leisurely read of Celtic mythology. Instead this book is really more of an academic discourse. I think Sjoestedt spends too much time talking about all the possibilities and ambiguities in our knowledge of Celtic mythology, which is great for an academic book, but terribly dull for a leisurely read :/"
2,Dull...overrated...a big disappointment,"I started listening to Beck for his humor and genre-mixing. While the idea of Beck getting serious intrigued me, the actual album didn't. Every song on the album feels the same. While others might be excited by the presence of someone who has produced for Radiohead and one of Beck's earlier albums, Mutations, the airy production only further detracts from the album. Syd Barrett, one of the big influences you'll hear here, had a sound of immediacy--on his solo recordings, it's as if he's right next to you, singing and strumming his guitar. Here, the production covers up Beck and obscures the lyrics.If you like acoustic psychedelic Syd Barrett-esque music, try Wilco's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot--it's what this album should have been like. If you still want a low-key Beck, try Mutations instead."
2,Beware - this edition is NOT The Hobbit,"This edition by Patricia Gray is a play based on The Hobbit by Tolkien. Do not buy this book thinking you are getting Tolkien's great book. As a play, it is O.K., but if you are looking for Tolkien's novel, The Hobbit, try another edition."
2,Oh-No!!! Another bad book from Dan,"This is the second Dan Appleman book that I have reviewed (the other being ""Developing Com/Activex Components With Visual Basic 6""). In both books, Dan starts to tell you about something and then he goes off on some tangent and starts talking about something else. Maybe he will get back to the original subject. This is like debugging spaghetti code, only this is Dan's writing style. It is very hard to follow and very frustrating. Not all of Dan's books are like this. I did not buy this book and when a friend asked me to review it, I was a little leary. Dan's book about API is very good. I was hoping for better from Dan. Too much talk. Remember Dan, Keep It Simple!!!"
1,Montovani on Acid,"This is really pretty horrible stuff. Joni tries to tackle some old standards and fails miserably. The backing is mostly overblown string arrangments that are brooding, pretentious and cloying. I don't know who would be interested in this recording. If you are a Joni fan, buy one of her old records. If you like old standards, buy the originals or albums of covers by stylists like LInda Ronstadt. More depressing than introspective."
5,Awesome CD for the money!!,"I was unsure of what performance these cd's would give, but I must say I am happy with these cds.I have a Lite-on drive, and these cds have not dropped a coaster yet. They not only look cool, (I love the black backing) like the playstation cds. I highly reccommend them to any who want new cds. They do cost alot, but they look so cool!!!Later"
4,Very Good,"This is a very good CD. It has interesting themes and is mostly just songs about and to girls by a girl, which in itself makes it interesting. The CD is generally soft and often the songs are very similar. It is not amazing, but it is unique, very good, and definitely worth a purchase."
3,Not bad . . .,"This is a decent film, but it doesn't hold a candle to it's big brother, 633 Squadron. 633 Squadron is an earlier film about the DeHavilland Mosquito's role, in part, during WWII. I am a fan of David McCallum so it caught my eye. It is an interesting film, but not a favorite. Given it to do over again I would rent the film, watch it, and leave it at that."
1,In a word: Lousy.,"Compared to their first two albums, I feel I have been had. I can't even listen to it. I bought it w/out sampling it first. It really is pretty sad to get a bad album. Next time, i'll review it beforehand.that being said, I still think the first two albums are genius. esp trust. sade-like sensuality in her voice. mmmm get it if you don't have it.Negu@arches.uga.edu"
1,skip this product,"It lasted four years. Then the hose spout broke off with a simple tug of the hose. Now there's just a flat open hole in the side where the hose should connect.During its short life, the hose repeatedly fell off the spout despite all efforts to tighten the cheap radiator hose style screw clamp. Hose falling off means dumping out all the stored water. Not a pleasant experience.The flimsy overflow hose died of sun exposure a few years ago despite the fact that the barrel is mostly shaded throughout the day.What a ripoff."
5,Helping Children Survive Divorce,This book is proving to be qute beneficial in helping our son's interaction with his two 11 and 15-year old sons during his divorce proceedings.
3,Great product while it lasts,"This is a great head set while it lasts, I buy lots of them and some have only lasted as little as a few weeks. I don't feel that it's too heavy or doesn't fit well like some people say but it needs to be built better to last longer! I could never imagine not having it as I am very busy while I am on the phone so both hands are free."
1,more backlash....,"The title of this book proves to me the soundness of Susan Faludi's arguments. This book and it's sentiment promote the myth that there are ""no good men left."" It's a sentiment designed to drive women back into the kitchen and out of the workforce. There seems to be some misconception that women NEED a man. The truth is, that the one person who truly benefits from marriage is the man."
5,cool!!!!!!!!!!,"golden sun 2 continues the story from the first game. You start out as Felix, Jenna, Sheba, and Piers (a new chracter) instead of Issac and his party. There's a lot more puzzles and some can get quite frustrating...There's also 44 more djinns to collect. You also ""earn"" new summon spells instead of the ones from GS1. You can also transfer data from your old game to GS2 (as long as you have a ""clear data"". I'm almost done with the game and so far it's pretty good! Since I transfered my old data to the new game, I have too much money...(i had 999,999 coins in the first game, no cheats!) It's an awsome game if you're interested in rpg's. GO GOLDEN SUN 2: THE LOST AGE!!!!!!! W00T!!!!!"
2,leaky and frustrating,unless you get the cap on just right these are leaky - i am not interested in playing with the cap a few times to get a correct seal when there are so many other bottles that never leak - I had 6 of them and thru them in the trash after countless leaks on my son's chest.
2,oK...,"Well this thing isnt tht great because you have to buy more targets if you dont have a copyer and when you shoot the target and the bbs go in the bb traper thing it gets big and small pieces of paper in there all over and you have to pick out you bbs without getting the paper, go buy a sticky taret, you shoot it they stick then fall to a trap."
4,"Great documentary, not really modern marvels","I ordered this because I had always wanted to see this episode, but it never was on TV. It arrived quickly and came boxed in the same way you would find it at a store, which I liked. The documentary was very well thought out and interesting, however, because it was from VERY eary in the series(2nd or 3rd episode) it is almost nothing like the modern marvels shown today, which probably explains its abscence from live TV. So, don't buy it beause you are a Modern Marvels fan, buy it because you are interested in NYC's second tallest building. It also is a great quality tape- first one I've bought in years!"
1,"Easy to see the bias, right from the start","Heavily biased, no real content. Cherry picked media out takes make ridiculous attempts to spin what really happened. Wouldn't really recommend for serious watching."
3,Believe It or Not...,"If you are unfamiliar with the name ""Abu Ghraib"" then you shouldn't even be reading this review or considering this film for viewing. I would suggest getting some, less graphic information about this situation before venturing on.I don't think anyone denies the attrosities that happened in this prison/interegation station. I think the only things that are still somewhat hidden/denied/ignored are the names behind the exact horrors and the depth of knowledge (of these actions) by those who should have been on top of every detail.Be prepared for the real nitty-gritty. This documentary is not meant for an after-dinner social hour and certainly not for children, those who are squeemish or those people who are proud of the actions (or lack-there-of) of then President Bush, his Staff, our Government Officials and a few Generals.Be prepared for some hard-core, hard hitting facts with picture proof."
2,"Not For Young Buzz Fans, But Try These...","My two-and-a-half-year-old son is obsessed with Buzz Lightyear, and yet this video didn't hold his interest for even a minute (literally). He will still watch both the Toy Story videos over and over, but not this one. Also, as many reviewers have noted, it is pretty violent, which bothered my son when the alien got blown up at the beginning.One day we happened to find the Buzz Lightyear cartoon on TV, and he was mildly interested in that, so I though maybe he might like this video again. When we tried watching it again, he still didn't want to watch it.If you're wondering what to get for a two-year-old boy, I can tell you that my son loves ""There Goes a Garbage Truck"", which is a 30-minute video about garbage, recycling, and street sweepers. It's been his favorite for a long time, and it's not as annoying as some videos. Also, the ""Baby Mozart"" series of videos (by Julie Aigner-Clark) are a favorite with both my son and daughter (8 mos.)."
5,Works great for VW Jetta TDI,"I picked this one instead of the non-powered Hoppy like Amazon says is a perfect fit. Don't listen to Amazon's filter for Jetta owners, this is the one you want. It is a little bit more a pain to route the power line from the battery to the trunk, but it is not that hard either.As a bonus the powered Hoppy is a separated power circuit from your lights, so you don't have the light dimming problem and timing change on the blinkers. As a bonus, if anything does go wrong with the wiring harness you still have your car lights working.I also like the extension cord so you can mount the box safely in the trunk and pull off the cord so you don't have it hanging outside getting corroded or ripped off when you go for that large Costco run.Get it, you will be happy."
2,"Non-Standard, EXPENSIVE Filters!","I previously owned an air filter that used standard-sized filters, so you could go to the hardware store and get a HEPA furnace filter in that size instead of paying a FORTUNE for the ""official"" replacement filters. I thought I would do the same on this model, but they wised up and used a completely non-standard filter size, so you have to go through them for the replacement filters (which cost as much as the unit does). The ionizer is nice, otherwise I would have given it 1 star."
3,not as awesome as it looks,"print quality is good, but not as good as I had hoped. paper feed wore out quickly and had to exchange twice- three printers & still not happy."
3,Lots of staff changed in the final release,I've had this book for a while and I can say that MS changed a lot of staff in their latest release. If you get this book you won't find many things the book talks about. My recommendation is to get Professional BizTalk by WROX(10 stars out of 5) and BizTalk Documented by Microsoft Press(8 stars out of 5)
1,not as good as the old ones,These shoes do not have the moving air pocket that the old classic DMX has. I would not reccomend them
4,Great..but did not like ending,"I really liked this book alot..it was hard to put down. I kept figuring out the mysteries, but knew at the end I would be proven wrong and would have a great surprise..well..all my guesses were right. I would have given this book 5 stars, but because of the ending, I gave it 4. It ended to fast and everything was wrapped up quickly with a nice little bow. With all the drama and suspense in the book, the ending was a disappointment."
5,So worth it,"I struggled with the decision between the WaterRower and Concept2. I made the right choice. This machine is quiet, clean, and simple. When I'm done with my workout, I stand it against the wall and it blends into my decor (I actually keep the thing in my living room and not even the girlfriend complains).If you're dedicated enough to row daily, buy one."
4,"Great Movie, came better than expected","The movie was in mint condition and even arrived earlier than expected. Granted my company's mailroom slowed it down getting it to me, it still came early.Thanks."
4,Addictive Fun,"The only other real-time strategy game I'd tried was Close Combat: A Bridge Too Far. I really enjoyed that one, and this one's almost as good. I have to say I really enjoy the early parts of the game the most, when you're making really tough decisions about division of labor. Later in the game, you're basically just building as big an army as possible (usually several times)."
4,salads,Great sald dressing. I would liked a longer than 6 month (use by) because there are only 2 of us.
1,AUtomatic ignitors constantly fail,"This product is poorly designed. The electronic ignitors on our unit failed 3 times in the first year and had to be replaced. When I called customer support, he admitted they are outsourced and made in China and haven't been reliable. Furthermore, when they were functional, it took a long time for the grill to light, causing combustion and minor explosion. Other problems: tThe heavy duty grill plate cracked twice from the heat.I thought I was getting top of the line product when I purchased the grill. The $300 weber I had was much better"
2,too drying,dried out my skin - but i DO have really sensitive skin.i used this 3 times and binned it.
5,Awesome book for new veggies,I love how most of the recipes contain ingredients that are readily available. I've tried about 15 or so of the recipes and they have been wonderful! Great resource for new vegetarians!
3,Liked it but would not recommend,I like this particular tub but I found one fatal flaw-whoever designed it put the drain on the bottom of the tub flush with the tub or sink. To drain out excess water or drain period you end up spilling or having to bail out the water with a cup. I find the tubs with the drains on the sides work much better with less mess.
2,Okay for casual training.,"I have owned Michelins in the past, and was never quite satisfied with them. They seem to wear very quickly. In my case, less than 1500 miles. These Speedium 2s are even worse. I have less than 1000 miles on these, and they are already paper thin. When I first put them on..., my bike handled quite a bit differently. Diving into turns, I did not seem so confident with these. The bike felt as it it were drifting. On my first ride, I remember getting off my bike three times to check if I had a flat. These tires are just plain weird."
3,Powerful and emotional but flawed,"This documentary, as powerfully emotional as it was, focused on the wrong issue. It would have been better to ignore the question of funding for Prop 8 and focus on the LDS' reactionary behavior on homosexuality. The Church of LDS should have as much right to contribute money to a political cause or ballot proposition as do gay rights groups. If they want to involve themselves in political activity, they should be allowed to--freedom of speech applies even to stupid ideas.I know some people will object--after all how can we allow groups with a tax exemption to spend millions on a campaign? A legitimate point, but the solution is to remove all churchs' tax exemption, not to restrict their speech."
5,"Fits my 2"" ball perfectly. Functions as expected.","I use this to cover my tow ball when I remove my hitch ball mount when I store my ball mount inside the truck. I use a LED brake light when I am not towingBully CR-025 LED Hitch Brake LightThis cover keeps the greased ball (Permatex 81981 White Lithium Grease, 12 oz. Aerosol Cancovered and keeps my trucks interior clean. I no longer have to wipe the ball clean for storage and then regrease the ball each time.I have no use for the ""4-way flat wiring mounting pocket to keep connector from the weather"", as the connector is part of the trailer and if you have this cover on, you are not connected the trailer....unless I am missing something?Overall, functions exactly as needed for my purpose and the price is right.Dan"
5,Keillor Rocks!,"Garrison Keillor does it again! He brings his ""Prairie Home Companion"" style to broadcast a live show from Mark Twain's home in Hartford Connecticut. For people familiar with his ""Prairie Home Companion"" show this show will be familiar except that this time it has a singular subject, Mark Twain. Keillor's love and admiration for Twain shows through as he takes you from room to room with descriptions, stories, and musical performances. I will admit my bias in that I am a fan of the ""Prairie Home Companion"" shows, but people who are familiar with Twain's work and people who are not so familiar alike will learn details about Twain listening to this engaging show. The live radio format lends itself to Twain as it is spontaneous much like Twain himself. If you are planning to visit the Mark Twain House, this program will greatly enhance your experience."
2,Yoke Broke...,"Initially, a great product. I bought one from my local boot repair shop, and it worked like magic when I wanted to remove one particular pair of dress boots I own that were previously impossible to get off without frustration and working up a serious sweat.However, after several uses, the wood on one side of the yoke on this product snapped off, rendering it unusable until I drove it back on with a few screws. Unless you feel like jury-rigging this cheaply made boot jack to endure stress, I'd recommend a more solid and expensive one."
5,Squirrel Proof Bird Feeder,This bird feeder is great. The squirrels have not been able to knock it down or get the seeds. It arrived quickly and was a great price. I would recommend this bird feeder to everyone.
5,Highly Entertaining - Top Chefs' Culinary Disasters,This book is a thoroughly entertaining collection of memorable disasters that have befallen well known chefs during their careers. A number of your Food Network favorites and others tell all... from dozens of spoiled lobsters to the chef that turned the hosts dogs loose on a damaged wedding cake in order to save the day. The chefs confess to challenges in which either amazing luck or noteworthy inventiveness was required to survive with reputation intact.
1,An exemplary service,Because an error in advertisement I received a wrong item. I waspromptly and fully recompensed.
5,CD-ROM's still a great tool!,"Enjoyed this cd-rom. The clarity and colors were wonderful. Blake would be very proud....From the companies web site one can buy a ""Blake bundle"" and it's like getting a free cd-rom...Peace, AJ"
5,Fits anywhere!,"Love the gates!! I purchased two for large spaces, set them up with ease, and had used them as an enclosure at first. Now, set up as gates, they move with ease around funiture and spaces that gates would normally not enclose. They basically fit anywhere. I would difinitly recommend them! They keep my twins out of trouble!!!"
4,How do we know this is Toltec wisdom?,"As much as I enjoyed the book and took away principles I will definitely cogitate and act on, I have to skeptically ask how can we actually know this is ""Toltec wisdom"" since it has been ""hidden for ages"" and only now coming out? (And I haven't even read The Fifth Agreement yet encouraging skepticism of any belief.) Someone help me out here."
3,I needed something to read,"Pretty good read, not as exciting as a Nesbo book, but a good book to read for some mind numbing entertainment"
5,get this if you like to THINK,"...As it says in the header, you should only try something like this out if you can stand to THINK. Trwstrynd Aylsquythe-Poynsenby is an iconoclast, he is an historian and a man of great learning. he does not however pander to watered-down opiates for a crutch-needing society.this material will, more likely than not, dispell a lot of illusions you entertain about the world and civilization in general. if you can handle what mr. Aylsquythe-Poynsenby has to say, i would really recommend it. if not, well, have a good day."
5,Wiked Sweet,I love this toy. it's way better than the PSP. the PSP stinks.It's the worst toy ever. I read a rieview it's crap. I swear the DS is the best toy ever. theres 2 screens 1.regular 2.touch screen. remember this the PSP sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.
3,Not that great...,"I absolutely loved Silence of the Lambs, so I was highly looking forward to Hannibal.And when I first saw it, I was less than thrilled. I'm not saying that it's horrible...it's just...not that good.You take Julianne Moore (who isn't as good as Jodie Foster) and the incredible Anthony Hopkins, who are both terrific actors, and you put them in a movie that is less than stellar.Hannibal is filled with too much gore, distasteful innuendos, and a horrible plot. It could be difficult to follow for some. Silence of the Lambs was a masterpiece, but Hannibal slanders the name masterpiece.If you truly love suspense, you will NOT like this movie...However, if you're into the whole blood/guts thing, you'll probably love this movie."
2,"Why, Naughty Dog? What did I ever do to you???","Jak & Daxter. This once-crap-then-excellent-then-crap-again series has been really on and off. The best moments of Jak were Jak II and Jak 3 while the bad were Precursor Legasy and of course: THIS BALL OF $%&#%#&$%&#$%$&#&$&#&$&#&%$&#$&$%&# MESS!!! The first three games in the series may have had vehicles in it (some even HAD racing) but turning it into a whole game is just ridiculus. THe graphics are nothing compared to Jak 3 and the sound is really crappy. There are new characters but all of them feel rushed and badly designed. There is an tired old gay racer called... Razer, and he speaks with the gayest accent I have EVER heard. He also looks gay and he smokes cigarettes AND looks gay while doing it. This is the gayest racing game EVER!!! The only point in buying this game is that Ratchet is in it just like another reviewer said.Jak X scores: 3/10Rent it if you are a die hard Jak fan. Otherwise, leave it!"
4,"not bad, easy system","This book starts out simple and builds on itself as you progress. It covers a broad range of med terms, with about 30 pages in each chapter and a good end of chapter review with different types of quizzes. The CD is also by chapter and has games to test you and also an area you can listen to the vocab words for pronunciation. My ""plastic comb"" version (not the spiral bound for more $) is falling apart after 2 semseters of use though."
5,Great Book!,This is a great book! Highly recommend. I purchased this book for my step-mother and she absolutely loves it. Terrific!
1,The Prometheus Deception,"It is obvious this was written by a ghost writer. GARBAGE, save your money!"
1,Defective disc!!,Defective DVD! It was labeled as being the movie but the disc had NO video data on it. I tried it in two different dvd players. I had seen this problem once before and the retailer ended up pulling the movie from his selves after verifying the lot was defective
4,four stars out of five,"My husband borrowed his friends Tom Tom One when we went on vacation earlier this year. It was a godsend. It was easy to use and assisted us with finding places to eat, hotel to stay at along the route and alternative routes if traffic was backed up. We decided to buy one of our own as a result of the positive experience. I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars for the rating for the simply fact that I feel that the unit should have a stylet on the side much like a PDA...but my husband does not. You decide."
3,Entertaining time passer,"Chain of Command is an acceptable,delivering made-for-video action film.Once again,Roy Scheider plays the US president (in slimy mode here)and the plot is strangely more intricate and surprising than you might expect from such a film.Overall,this delivers the goods and is very watchable because of it."
4,For those who can't afford an iPod...,"For those Mac users who can't afford an iPod, the Nomad II is the next best thing in pocket-sized MP3 players. You can even use it to record voice memos and listen to the radio. Let's see your iPod buddies do that!"
4,Nice Mix,"If you are a Vincent Price fan & know anything about his acting background you will enjoy this fun mix of films. Look for some outstanding supporting actors and the ""Phibes"" movies are truly just diabolical fun!"
4,Baby book,Very cute book - colorful pages - bought it for a one year old and he lovesthe tactile pages.
2,DAV-C770,"I have mixed feelings about my new DAV-C770. The pros: The overall sound upgrade from my old (non-surround sound) system is a major improvement. The sound quality is excellent and the five disc CD/DVD player is a major bonus not found in many systems this size and at this amount. Now the cons: DO NOT BE MISLEAD, 90 watts a channel as a crock. I'm not sure who does the ratings for Sony but a corporate calibration of all equipment they use to measure output wattage is way over due. My old 45 watt Yamaha will spank this little component right in the amp and never look back. If you're looking for a small relatively inexpensive system with good sound, this is your unit. If you occasionally want to mix it up with the guys and rock the house, save the embarrassment and buy something else. My C770 still has that new toy smell ..."
1,Worthless!,"I rarely ever return items because it's such a hassle. But this, is being returned immediately. The idea is actually very good- it has a side heater to heat up the clips as well as the rollers, a feature I've never seen before. However, the clips do not hold- at least not in my long hair. No matter how many times I tried, the rollers would always fall out within a few seconds. Even when I stayed completely still (very difficult when putting in the remaining rollers) they would still fall out. They never stayed in long enough for me to see how well the curlers worked."
1,If you've read Haunted Illinois save your money,"This book was a gross disappointment and a waste of money. Repeating the stories and the history in Haunted Illinois relative to Alton, throwing in a few new and adding a (very) few about some nearby towns, made for a very dissapointing book. There is a great deal of vagueness about the location of a number of the sites he writes about. There are plenty of new typos and errors, which would make one hope that any forthcoming books get a good proof reading before printing. Since that appears to be a commonality of his work, I am not expecting it to come about. Oh, and as far as the invitation to look him up if you visit Alton (presumably by stopping by his shop/museum) - apparently that is out of date or another typo - he doesn't welcome visitors - not even buyers and fans of his work."
1,June Cleaver is Dead,"This book gives an unrealistic portrayal of what love is. Most of the suggestions Chapin gives make it sound like the woman should be a slave to the man. Your husband is supposed to be your friend and someone you can be comfortable and open with, not someone you have to constatly worry about impressing. Overall, I did not agree with the message that this book presented."
3,Great for book club discussion,"Read the complete review at: [...]All in all, the book was an easy read, pretty entertaining and has a good dose of drama. The pace was decent and I was able to read the book pretty quickly. This book is what I would consider light summer reading. The book also brought some very good conversation for the book club, and it would be a good pick for that purpose."
1,Unbelievably Bad,"Ferguson makes so many mistakes... how does anyone take this fast talking swindler seriously? He pretends to be a modern day Kenneth Clarke but his grasp of history and his unfounded conclusions are totally bunk. I cannot even begin to counter all the mistakes he makes. How the hell did Harvard get taken in by this crap??? He actually uses the word egalitarian incorrectly!!! He incorrectly links WESTERN Rock N Roll to sex rather than rebellion against authority. He totally misses that the root of the word PROTESTant is protest. Way better, more entertaining and informative: James Burke's Connections, better David Starkey's Monarchy, and best of all Kenneth Clarke's Civilization. Ferguson is a cultural light weight with a $500 hairdoo."
1,"This book just didn't cut it for me, or any of those people.","Licking through a field of corn, you just don't know whose watching you, and these days I wouldn't want to trust this book to my family or anyone else's family, or Bill, or my work people."
2,Haven't lasted long....,"This space heater is easy to use, heats up quickly and was quiet....qualities I loved.The down side is we've had two of the exact same ones and each one broke down. We only used it in the evenings in a spare bedroom in the colder months (so NOT running all the time). After buying two....and having them no longer heat we're on to another brand. Buyer beware or be sure to keep up with the warrantee and paperwork to be sure to get your money back."
5,t shitrt for rls,just what he needed Hard to find in the store liked the color and fabric will beed more later share this with others
1,great message gets lost in the anger and insult,"She almost touches on a wonderful topic of moving beyond egocentric manifestation to allowing the wonder of the Universe to carry us. But it is hard to sit though her mocking sales clerks, insulting people who seek her guidance, talking about how greedy and petty humanity is etc. I wanted to put my arm around her and say, ""honey, why so angry? Take a deep breath, it'll be okay."" The message she almost touches on is explored by Ernest Holmes, Emma Curtis Hopkins and Troward if you are interested. The reason I gave it one star was because she really slams people who light candles and use oils repeatedly calling them idiots yet she sells ""sacred"" candles, ""sacred stone necklaces"" and oil sets for hundreds of dollars on her website. That my friend is low."
1,terrible,lousy.We ended up getting different ear plugs because when exercising these would stay in your ears.Had to get a different brand that has the blue tooth look to stay in place while exercising.
4,Love this show,"Would have been five stars if not for buffering problems. This could have been due to my rural location. Worth the nuisance in order to ""catch up""."
2,"Not as good as ""Devil Wears Prada""","This book is slightly boring. If you want to read about a spoiled neurotic woman, this book is for you! I had trouble finishing it."
1,THEIR WORST EVER WORK YET!!!!!,ALTHOUGH THIS IS 'THE BEST OF' ALBUM I DON'T THINK THEY CHOSE THE RIGHT SONGS FOR THIS ALBUM.ANY OF THEIR SONGS WOULDN'T BE RIGHT FOR THE ALBUM BECAUSE THEY ARE S**TETHE SONGS THEY CHOSE WERE WICK!!!THEIR VIDEOS GIVE ME NIGHTMARES ESPECIALLY THE ONE WERE A HELICOPTER FALLS ON THEM!TOTALY S**TE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!THIS GETS THE DARTH YOPA RATING OF NO THUMBS UP OR DOWN!!THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME!
1,Even one star is being kind,"Justified is in plain and simple terms the worst album in recording history.Justin is the worst of the worst and is much more worse tan Britney,chris brown and the likes.Avoid at all costs.Get Born in the USA from Bruce Springsteen instead."
1,worst ethnic movie EVER!,"I am simply amazed by this movies' ratings! How could people give such a junk movie 5 stars? I would have given it a ZERO. Why? Beacause it is a movie made by ignorant folks who have no knowledge of the Asian community. It is a highly offensive movie. It demonizes men as wife beaters (like nobody else on earth beats their wife), tyrannical father who ""all in all"" in the family and barely literate. Folks that made this movie, have absolutely no idea how Asians raise their kids in Asia and abroad. There are of course families that feels more attached to their roots and there are those who feels more connected to the new settlement. However, in this movie, it appears that the illiterate demon (the father) reamins a demon even after living 25 with an English woman. Watch this movie with ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"". You will see how racially insulting this movie is. Even you might feel ashamed that you have watched it. I know I am."
5,Stellar Entertainment!,Fantastic book! So funny and informative... She's like a celestial yenta... matchmaking by the stars. More more more!
5,Delish,"My husband and I really, really like this product. Compared to the convenient powder in packets, this dissolves much easier and is more economical for home and office. No after taste and very, one 1/4 dropper in cup-o-jo or tea is just what we like. Remember to refrigerate after opening."
3,3rd Party Super Nintendo Controller,This is a great look alike controller. The only thing that I really don't like is the fact that the cord is way shorter then the original for the super nintendo.
4,Fight - 'War Of Words' (Epic),"As most of you do know,Fight was,of course the band that Rob Halford formed after twenty years of fronting Judas Priest,along with Priest drummer Scott Travis.Bassist Jay Jay and guitarists Brian Tilse&Russ Parrish round out the group's line-up.The killer tracks are easy to spot here,like ""Into The Pit"",the in-your-gut ""Nailed To The Gun"",the heavily riffed ""Immortal Sin"",""Contortion"" and ""Reality,A New Beginning"".Plain and simple,a truly great '90's metal release.The follow-up to this effort,'Small Deadly Space' isn't as good.Thank goodness Halford has now rejoined Priest.I ALWAYS thought he would have,eventually."
5,Plastic but works,"Tried these out on my Yugo SKS and it helped a great deal. I had a hard time seeing the old front sight,black on black, in all but ideal light and background. It is a good idea and will use it till something better comes along. I cant see that happening any time soon. I gave one to my brother who used it on his AK-47 and he love it also. Hope it holds up to the heat of a hot barrel. Its winter here in Michigan so I cant get anything hot enough to comment on that. Will buy more if I do break it somehow....Good product idea."
5,This book should arrive with your Easy Bake Oven,"After purchasing my first mix for my son's Easy Bake Oven, I knew there had to be a better, and less expensive, way. This book has some excellent recipes in it - things I am happy to make and eat with my son. The half-dozen we have tried so far have been consistently good. Further, it allows my son to actually cook, instead of just adding water. I have to help a little more with things, since there are more ingredients and more steps, but the results are satisfying for both of us. And best of all - the desserts and snacks are portion controlled."
2,Not enough animals.,"This video suffers from a lack of actual animal babies. The makers opted to use a lot of computer animation of a lizard character supposedly guiding the viewer through the world of animal babies, but the lizard and his bad childcare habits (he has a baby lizard of his own)is downright disturbing. I would only reccommend this video for older children who can deal with the content (baby spiders consuming their mother, a bird that lays its eggs in other birds nests, then upon hatching, destroys the other birds' eggs, and deserts the foster parents)."
2,"No, it isn't java e-commerce!","In the whole book, the authors discussed one case of using a swing GUI to query an Oracle database, coffee shop. Although querying a database may be considered part of e-commerce, it is hardly enough! Jsp, Servlets and EJBs were only mentioned briefly towards the end of the book. Even for additional reading, it is hardly worth the time and money( there are some errors in the sql scripts as some other reviewers has pointed out ).Java has come a long way since the time this book was published and there are much better books now:1. If you want to learn java and Oracle, buy wrox' Pro Oracle8i with java and xml.2. If you want to learn java e-commerce, buy also wrox's Pro Java E-commerce.You will not regret buying these two books."
4,Great Product!,Had some initial problems that Windows 2000 did not recognize the hard drive using a USB port. I had to log in as Administrator. The formatting to NTFS took about 20 minutes. Retrospect express software is especially useful and extremely fast. Would be nice if the price was lower and it came with a carrying case.
5,Funny,"It was a gift to a friend...her thank you note reads ""I am really enjoying my New Yorker cartoon book. Granted, some of them are over my head. But others are laugh-out-loud funny."""
2,Not Feeling It,"I read this book with high expectations. I ended up being disappointed.While it is a work of fiction, I still found it to be overly unrealistic and hard to relate to any of the characters - especially the main character.It is a page-turner and can keep you interested. However, as a literary work and a story, I don't think it really has the glue to stick to anything."
1,again disapointed,"It you liked the original Movie you will be disapointed, it is just a rip off of the original theme, the new cast can't compare and it is a different house, don't waste your time or money on this one, Christmas Story is a classic this one is junk!!"
3,not worth the money,"I was so excited about this purchase and became more excited when it arrived and I learned how easy it is to use. However, I quickly learned that it is far from accurate. I personally spent the money on this product because I wanted accuracy not just the guessing game. I can stand on the scale and get a reading, step off, step on again and get a totally different reading. That is screaming inaccuracy to me. Its easy to set up and use, but who knows if anything it tells you is true or not."
5,gotta love this,it is the very best in its class. I have tried all the others and after a little research this one did it all.
5,Not Free SF Reader,"This is an omnibus containing Taltos and PhoenixA novel in three parts, or streams. Vlad is involved in some heavy duty witchcraft, is looking back at his earlier life in some greater detail than in earlier books, and is also showing us how he met Morrolan.As far as the latter goes, a complicated sorcerous plot leads Vlad and Morrolan on a decidedly dangerous mission to Deathsgate Falls and the Paths of the Dead.A couple of the important magical artificats appear : Spellbreaker, for Vlad, and Aliera's Great Weapon.4.5 out of 5Vlad gets himself into quite a lot of poo owing to his desire to keep his estranged wife Cawti from being executed as a revolutionary.Before that, though, he makes a deal with his patron goddess of witchcraft, and the two end up being related via the kingdom of Greenaere, some 'work' and possible war.Vlad ends up on the lam from the Jhereg because he testifies about their goings on to the Empress.4 out of 5"
2,"Good movie, download was poor","The movie was entertaining. The picture quality was good, however there was a significant amount of digitization throughout the movie as it was downloaded through TIVO. I paused the movie for over an hour and still had the issues even though I had the full movie downloaded. Not sure what the issue was, but the movie was relatively cheep for a rental and I pushed through anyway!!"
3,Higland Lady,"This book has one of the strongest heroines I've come across in a long while. Elen, is as much a warrior as her hero Munro, who is also her prisoner. Her sister is kidnapped by Munro's brother and to get her back safely she takes Munro prisoner. She treats him fairly and during her visits to him to get info on why her sister has been kidnapped and if she's ok, Elen falls for Munro and he for her. He is clueless as to why his brother has done what he did but starts to actually enjoy being Elen's prisoner. After the kidnapping is resolved and he is released he tries to woo her with gifts but she is not impressed or at least she appears that way. He finally enlists the help of the scottish king, his friend, to make him marry her. The whole thing almost blows up in his face but in the end she she is as happy as he is. I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it highly."
5,wonderful,"great songs, sexy voice and super lyrics....with great music. what more could anyone want......"
4,What is in this book,"This book is absolutly fantastic!. It has the currently best fantasy authors such as Robert Jordan, Raymond E Feist and George R.R Martin. Such talent will no doubt provide a great read for you, especially if you are a fantasy lover. Even if you are not, the depth of such short story's is unbelieveable and for a reasonable price this book is a must get for your bookshelf. Cracking Stuff!"
4,No higher truth,"The item was original, beautiful and creative. However, the pewter is so soft, I don't wear it because I'm afraid I'll bend or break it."
2,Sansui 27-inch TV,I loved this tv because it was a perfect fit and had a great picture. But only lasted one year
3,Appealing but Lite,"I appreciate the author's honesty and sincerity - and have no doubt that she had a special friendship with Mister Rogers. But the book lacks depth (also commented upon by another reviewer). The author states that Fred Rogers greatly admired and was a friend of Henri Nouwen, that renowned priest, pastor, professor and writer of the 20th century, yet also admits that she has read nothing of Nouwen. My sense is that she doesn't have the background to be able to articulate the contemplative heart of Rogers' faith. It is a friendly, easy read, appealing for all who love Mister Rogers - so see it as an introduction to the spiritual perspectives of this wonderful man, but not, by any means, as a full representation of his profound and visionary faith in Christ."
5,Terrific Movie!,"I thought this movie was great! It was a thilling movie with actually funny comedy, not the usual cheesieness. Shamalayn did a great job keeping the suspense without ever really seeing what was terriorising Earth. It reminded me of getting scared with all my friends as a kid over something one of us thought we saw out of the corner of our eyes. The kids were absoultly hilarious! It got even funnier when the adults started to get caught up in all the alien stuff with the kids. I saw it 3 times in the theater and have it on reserve for when it comes out on dvd. I would defiently recommend this movie. It was a nice change of pace from the typical alien movies where the only way get rid of them is to blow 'em up."
4,This is a cute movie!,"Get over the subtitles and this is a awesome movie! It's so cute and sad and happy! The subtitles aren't bad to read either. Alot of foriegn lesbian films are better in my opinion, and this is a must have!!!! It was very popular in Europe when it came out."
5,great learning tool,"We really loved it as did the kids. Only problem for us, and it is a problem specific to our environment and hard on all electronic tools we use, we were using it in a therapeutic riding environment which means sandy etc. Hard on the tools/toys here. But it lasted a good year out here!"
2,Good but questionable durability,I bought this a year ago and was excited and happy with it. Now about a year later I'm dissapointed enough to write this review. The first thing to go missing was the little black knob that is the brake. Then one day the top came apart and now parts are missing. Oh well! I guess I got a year out of it - though I don't consider that long enough. I just don't know which one is better and more durable?
5,"Feelin' like a ""Wuz""","I can't imagine how she stayed with this voyage til the end. I thought I was an adventurer having been a day sailer,an assistant commercial fisherman, a USO entertainer and a 3rd world nurse..but Tania--she's the queen!! Best book I ever read. Hat's off to you Lady."
2,An unfortunate mess,"When the camera tracks for a full minute just to get to the double doors for Taylor's entrance, you know you're in for a slow. plodding time. Prince proved he may be a genius on the stage but is pretty clueless when it comes to movies; he took what was essentially bullet-proof material and made it dull. Poor Sondheim -- this is almost as appalling as the film version of FORUM."
2,Lopsided,"I bought this cup to allow my baby boy drink some juice. I liked the soft ""spout"" feature and figured it would be easier on his gums, but the handles won't line up correctly with the spout. It is too hard for him to hold the handle at the bottom and top of the cup when he is trying to drink, so we just don't use it. Also, it arrived in pink, I wasn't given a color choice, but I wouldn'thave chosen pink for a boy!"
3,"Okay to soften the sole, not support the arch.","If all you want is a softer bottom to your shoe, these may work well, but they will not add support to your arch."
5,"Great, great collection -- but just scratches the surface","Wow, 120 songs on 4 CDs, and they are almost all killer, no filler. You know the sixties was an absolutely incredible decade for music when even the *obscure* stuff was good! Never mind the Beatles, Hendrix, Dylan, Stones, Doors, and all the rest, a lot of this stuff ranks right up there as my favorite '60s tunes.For all its seeming breadth, however, this 4-CD collection barely scratches the surface. I am still waiting for cleaned up, remastered versions of tunes like ""Crackin' Up"" by the Wig, ""I'll Be Gone"" by the Opposite Six, ""You Better Look Now"" by the Rogues, ""I Can't Stand This Love"" by the Others, and on and on.If you want to dig a little deeper, check out the ""Essential Pebbles"" collections. The sound quality isn't as stellar as Nuggets, but the songs are."
2,Repetitive,Somewhat repetitive and I'm not into books that glorify rape fantasies. Not what I expected at all. I wouldn't recommend it.
5,Polenta,"I will definitely buy this product again. It is excellent, fast to prepare and the flavor and consistency are perfect."
4,Good enough for it's price,"We originally bought this for our son at a year old, but I think that's a bit too early really for a device like this. Now he is just over 2 years old, he will sit and play with it. I really can't understand the comments about poor graphics. They are perfectly fine for the purpose it is intended for and they certainly do not resemble those of an Atari 2600. That's just plain insulting to this product. What were people expecting? Playstation or Xbox quality graphics at this price point? My wife and I also kept wondering if we even had the same product as we haven't heard any mispronunciation of words either. Kids at this age treat them roughly and attention spans are limited anyway so I would rather spend $40 on this than some much more expensive device that would offer little more benefit for this age group. When he's old enough we'll get him a real computer with 'better graphics' but certainly not when he's 2 years old!"
4,Wonderful!,"This is the first Demille book I have ever read, and it is because I heard that it would be made into a movie starring John Travolta (I'm a BIG fan), but I wasn't disappointed at all! The best thing about it is its ""no s*it"" characters. It's so bitingly witty, and you actually ""move along"" with the characters. I don't know how to describe it, but the characters are such that you would want to see them again in another book. I am now in the middle of Plum Island, which is even better than this I think!"
4,What a great book!!!,"I love this historicle fiction book, it used GREAT discription and had a great plot that kept me interested the intire time! Although some parts were very sad, and the time change was rather confusing I loved it. The book tells a story of a boy in the civel war. He has just turned 16 and is allowed to join the army. He is eager to fight for the North. Then a misterious girl appears off a boat and is welcomed into the Pruitt family. The girl appears to be keeping Noah from leaving and the mother is thankful for that. What will hapen? I LOVE this book!!!"
1,Ineficient,"This unit is worthless for any kind of cutting using the combs. Hair just builds up above the cutters and very quickly making any kind of cutting a joke. The hairs just don't clear away, they just pack into the area between the comb and the unit itself. It does OK with out the combs but no good with a comb attached."
2,Tech probs,I bought this disk off the shelf and had problems getting it to play. After 6 or so trys it played. It's a good disc although the sound could be better. I've exchanged my disc in hope of getting one that will play straight away. A booklet would have been very nice...
1,Worked once and then dies.,I replaced a grind and brew that was a few years old because the front kept popping open.The new one worked once and then died.
4,"Try it, you might like it","I'm not into this sort of stuff. Too contrived, I thought. About six months ago I was in Houston, and was persuaded to see these guys live. Their energy is totally infectious and I was blown away. So try it, like me you may be pleasantly surprised."
1,Learning American Sign Language,"I was very disappointed when I saw this book. I ordered it used and it looked like a dog ripped it up. I don't think a book costing $38.00 should look like this. I was also very disappointed to see that I could not return this book. I ended up dropping this class and have no use for this book anymore, and I don't think anyone will buy this book from me considering the shape it is in. Overall I was not satisfied and may look to other sites for purchasing books from now on."
5,Great Performance - You be the judge of reliability,I just purchased my third. My previous two lasted over two years each. I am a hobbyist woodworker but also refinish furniture and I estimate I've put 100+ hard hours on each of my previous two. I use dust collection about 80% of the time. I rate this sander's performance at 5 stars because it is agressive and powerful with little vibration and performs its intended duties well. In my experience it outperforms direct competitors' models and has better reliability. I am more than satisfied with the durability and rate it 5 stars as well because the operating cost relative to purchase price is quite cheap - beats hand sanding!
4,A nice collection engangingly played,"I initially bought this because I wanted the original piano version of Claire de Lune and it was reasonably priced. The entire disk is a treat and is one that I pull out more often than I ever thought I would. The playing is rhythmically engaging - soft when needed and aggressive as appropriate. The sound is not a clinically detailed sound but is one that you might truly hear a few rows back in a concert. Overall, just a wonderful experience and well worth the money!!"
1,Rowenta's poor customer service,"I owned this iron for six months when I started having problems with it leaking excess water on my clothes. I called Rowenta, and they had me send it in for service. Most people only have one iron, so this was a real inconvenience. It was repaired; three months later I had the same problem. Rowenta's customer service representative was extremely rude, complacent about my recurring problem, and gave invalid excuses for the malfunction. He told me to send the iron in again. It would cost me another $10 to do so; and, again, they were not going to pay for postage. So, after deciding I did not want to go without my iron again and investing a total of $20 in postage I opted to throw it in the garbage. I now own a Euro-Pro and am extremely pleased with it."
1,The screen moving up and down at its own will,"I have returned the screen because of the malfunction. It only comes with the remote control and does not include the wired wall-mount control ($50 + shipping if purchase from elitescreen.com). When I first set it up and connected it with power, without touching any button on the remote control, the screen started moving down for a few seconds, then going back up for a few seconds, then moving down again, and then moving up again, .... It keeps doing that at its own will for no reason and I have no ways of making it to stop. Removed batteries from the remote control did not help. At a point, the screen started to tilt and eventually stuck in the middle of the operation."
2,Poor quality - breaks easy.,"At first glance, this is a nice big feeder with the ability to put 3 different types of seeds in it to feed different types of birds. The birds loved it! But, within 1 week of owning it, the lawnmower knicked it and the pole buckled and the entire thing fell to the ground. I was able to straighten the pole and put it back up (at a crooked angle). Our lawn man knicked it again and this time, when it fell, it broke into many pieces. I had to throw it all away. The lawn guy didn't hit it hard either time. The pole is made very cheaply and will not withstand any time of damage. The feeder itself is cheap plastic and will crack if dropped.For the amount of money this costs, you would think you would receive a better made product. I was very disappointed."
2,"Not too Sunny,rather cloudy","Not Kern or Hammerstein at their best,title tune repeated too many times , story as told ,is about as dumb as one would expect for a show of the era.To revive the show would be a task of no rewards."
1,Don't buy it,"Ezzo's philosophy is harmful to babies. If you are looking for a parenting book, try the DR. Sears Baby Book."
4,The Disabled Kids,"This was one of the best books I have ever read.The reason I liked the book was because the chidren were disabled and unhappy; then their angel came.He was so nice that he made them believe in themselves and made them feel that being disabled doesn't mean you can't enjoy yourself as normal people.But I wasn't as happy as I thought I would be because all the kids died at the end which made it more sad.They had been through a lot, and I wanted them to be as happy as their angle made them feel."
1,"Labels dont stick, ink fades","After only a few weeks, the labels begin to peel. Eventually, the writing fades completely! Especially if you put the label in an area exposed to sunlight, like in a car. Three weeks tops, and you can barely read the text anymore. I am going to try to upload some pics so you can see what I mean. There are ancient label writers out there that make labels that last for YEARS! What a piece of junk. Do NOT buy this label writer! Look elsewhere!!!"
5,This dvd is awesome. I love Journey,This dvd totally rocks. I think Steve Augeri does an awesome job. Journey made a great choice when the chose Steve Augeri for the lead singer. Rock on Journey!!!Julia
5,Love it!,I bought this item for my husband. He loves it! He said the handles are long enough so he doesn't feel the heat from the grill and the spatula lets him easily get the burgers off the grill to flip.
2,Worked well for the first 2 months,This vacuum worked well for the first 2 months and my wife adored it. Unfortunately the vacuum quit working on us. I am looking for the warranty book now to hopefully get warranty service on it. If it was still working I would give it 4 Stars.
2,Sad attempt to save a sinking ship,"I've been a huge Solas fan for 4 years, so I was thrilled to hear of their most recent release.I cannot describe my disappointment when I found out Solas lost their lead singer AND their lead guitarist. Both members were vital to the band's success, as is proven by this CD. The new lead vocalist pales in comparison to Karen Casey - she has a fine sense of pitch and a clear tone, but she lacks musicality almost entirely. The new guitarist is adequate, but no match for the previous musician's unique rhythmic style. I suspect that the addition of a percussionist to the group is a sad attempt to make up for that loss. Unfortunately, both the percussionist and the new electric bassist only serve to drown out what's left of talent in this shadow of a formerly fantastic band. Seamus should take some time off and reconsider his next musical adventure instead of hanging on to the crumbling shell of Solas."
2,"Cheap, noisy pump","We bought one of these at our local pet store. The first night we used it, the fountain was completely silent. I had to check it a few times to make sure it was still on. The next night, it sounded like a small refrigerator. Something must have gone off-kilter in the pump, causing it to vibrate, but I couldn't find anything stuck or broken. Back to the pet store it went!"
2,Not for carpets!,"This vacuum is wonderful for hardwood and tile floors, BUT NOT FOR CARPETS!!! I don't even have a high pile carpet, and it gets bogged down and does not move easily. I don't like the bagless cleaner because there is more dust flying into the air when you empty the canister than when you just detach the bag and throw it away. The attachments do not stay attached to the cleaner and easily fall off. The floor nozzle is wonderful because it rotates easily to get into the hardest corners. I am sorry I spent the money for this cleaner and will be buying another for my carpets."
1,just looking to complain about Amazon.com...,"advertised: Limited Edition w/Bonus Discshipped: regular version sans Bonus DIscremedy: Amazon sends you ANOTHER regular version and asks you to pls return the first regular version (!!)judgement: they do NOT read emails; they just funnel you into standard pre-determined ""Ways to Resolve General Types of Complaints"" w/no interest in actually helping...Jeff Bezos, is you is or is you ain't listening?"
4,A good introduction,This is a good introduction to the area of brainwave entrainment- it can give users a first taste. But the best choice would be to research the subject and use custom audio programs like NP.
3,Really bad art and animation,"Although this was a pretty good adaption of the Hobbit and crammed a lot into 78 minutes, my biggest gripes are the art, which is purely awful and the many songs. I really got bored with the characters breaking into song every minute. A few songs are okay, but throughout the whole movie? I also found myself falling asleep during the last half so really can't critique it on content. Lord of the Rings (animated) is ten times better."
1,"Plastic ""Crap-tastic!""","The name would lead you to believe that this is a powerful tool which can ""crush"" ice to a blended perfection for your favorite summer cocktail. Not so. The blender works fine for lighter fare such as eggs, fruit, etc. but ice killed mine. The problem is the plastic drive connection that under strain seems to break into a thousand tiny pieces. Also, if you try to find replacement parts at the B&D site, you're directed to a partner site that is less than helpful. I've had great success with their power tools but this thing is craptastic."
3,Kinda thin all around but some highlights,"There are a couple of tracks I really like, 'Baby Dream in Cellophane' and 'Stranger By the Minute'. But over all, the songs are as thin and the arrangements are as shallow as the stuff from the late 80's. I know Steve Wilson and the band can do better (and has with 'In Absentia'). You get the video to 'Piano Lesson' which is very early 90's production. The 5.1 mixes are just as boring. I'm very unimpressed and disappointed with the 5.1 mixes (but the images are pretty). Porcupine Tree is such a hit-or-miss group. They got it right with 'In Absentia' but crashed-and-burned with 'Deadwing'. I hope the next release is better."
3,Bait and switch,"As you can see from the other reviews, the book is written from the perspective of a bleeding heart liberal. Nothing wrong with that. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. But since I found the book in the writing section of Barnes an Noble amongst other books purely about the craft of writing I felt cheated. The outside of the book does not inform you of her slant. That's just not right. I just wanted some writing tips, not a political agenda. Shame on the publisher."
3,Hilarious classic... edited,"The other review explains how Flip acquired the rights to his show in the early90's and edited the episodes for rerun play. However, I think it was a mistake to use these edited versions for DVD. The editing isn't always very good, and watching the picture gallery feature makes one long for the scenes that are included there but not in the episodes themselves. Still, it's worth it for what is included!"
3,library book,I was disappointed to find that the book was an out of circulation library book from Florida. It had the plastic cover and call numbers still on the book. I wouldn't have purchased it if I had known this.
1,HORRIBLE - THIS HAS TO BE A HOAX,"After suffering through this pathetic ragbag novel, I, a lover of good literature both modern and traditional, have come to the unmistakeable conclusion that the critical raves for ""The Handyman"" must be one of the century's greatest hoaxes. I just wonder who is trying to fool the public. I implore anyone reading this to beware! Carolyn See's novel is the most inept, pathetic excuse for literature imaginable. This book was so poorly written, so depressing in its shallow conception, that it is offensive to the intelligence of the average reader. I was amazed that See cannot write a complex sentence, let alone a sentence of more than five or six words. High School stuff this is. Unbelieveable!"
4,"First pair did not work, but prompt replacement did!","The product itself is cheaply made and that is reflected in the price. For my W800i it been doing the job for the past few weeks now, and so thumbs up for an otherwise cheaply made product."
2,Book is not very well bound,"This is a great resource. It's very helpful and well organized but unfortunately, the binding is poor. My copy has been used only a couple of months and it's literally falling apart."
4,Does What It Supposed to Do,"This cable release does what it claims, no more, no less. I use it for an e-1; it can also be used for the newer e-3. Unfortunately, a different model has to be used for all other Olympus 4/3 cameras (a USB cable release). I wish Olympus had standardized on one or the other, but they're no different from other camera manufacturers in this respect. Otherwise, cable release seems well-made."
5,Great frame that's a little different.,"I'm really surprised at how nice and novel this frame set is. I originally purchased it with just a use for a project in mind, but now I think I'll get a couple more.First of all the worst part. It's smaller than it appears to be. The LARGEST picture size is 4X6, which is the orange tree in the product picture, and they go down from there.Good stuff - Well made, nice looking, and something different.2 pictures fit in each plastic frame back to back, so it's a new adventure every time you turn it. This would be great on some kind of motorized turntable. Otherwise turn it once a week or something and you'll have different views all of the time. The base is slotted all of the way across both vertically and horizontally so that you can position the frames any way you want, you're not stuck to what you see here.Definitely a nice way to display little snapshots you have lying around."
4,Great for stretching!,"This is a great video. I am in my second, going on my third trimester, and really love all the stretching. Especially as your posture changes during pregnancy, this helps keep your back flexible. However, if I were still in my first trimester, I would supplement this with a slightly more intense yoga or workout. You don't burn a whole lot of calories doing this."
2,its Ok,"It is a hard topic, Blood ewee but there is HEALING Power in the BLOOD of JESUS, really, our human blood is important well priceess to us, we can not live with out it, But the BLOOD of JESUS has Healing Power"
5,what a great idea,Each popsicle can be individually removed and refilled meaning that you will never have to be without your homemade pop's
2,NOT FOR MACS,If you own a MAC do not get this camera. There are a lot of UVC Compliant WebCams. These WebCams will work on the USB network without a driver. This is not one of them.
1,Defective unit,"Unit arrived defective (would not move though I could hear the motor running).The return experience was excellent. Packed it up, attached the pre-paid return label, and sent it off. I was credited within 3 days."
3,I'm not really sure what I think,"The book was really well written but at times, it just completely lost me and I found myself wondering, what's the point? I like the series so far but it's always leaving me wanting more and not always in the best way."
4,Joan of Arc,Joan of ArcJoan of Arc should be recommended for teens 13-16. I thought it was kind of hard to understand because I got 60% on this Accelerated Reader test. I didn't understand the Crowning of the Kings and Princesses very well. I would rate this a 6/10 in a rating.It taught me about how some people can get so sick of things that you would do anything to save your country. This book is cool because of the pictures of the war.
5,"A good note on this ""Notebook""","If you are a Partridge Family hardcord fan you will not be dissapointed with this re-masted reissue of this time capsule. Not only do you get the best sound quality in this package, your getting the UK art work release for its front cover, and more linner notes than the original release! You will be more than ""Happy' with this release in your collection."
1,Used this product for years,"I have used this shampoo for years. I ordered the product and when I was finally finished with my previous bottle, upon opening, I was suspect that something was off. The color did not look right. After about 5 uses and buying a bottle from a reputable salon, I am sure this bottle is either counterfeit or the product sold at Target and this seller is trying to pass this off as the expensive version. I would use caution before ordering this and frankly buy direct from the manufacturer."
5,The Sound Of Galaxies Being Born,"holy F---! ambient drone metal goodness! think my bloody valentine meets sunnO))) Million Year Summer and We All Die Laughing are worth the price of admission alone. crank it loud, be enveloped in the washes of fuzz and go for the gooey melodic center. i cant stop listening. this is the sound of galaxies being born and dying. buy it NOW!"
2,Only b/c it is a class requirement,"Stokstad's book is surprisingly biased, and full of subtle indications of cultural elitism. While this is a common problem in Western-published books on the history of art, I always find it galling when confronted with specific examples. Perhaps it is wrong of me to give a low rating to a book which has failed to be better than any of its peers, but I only purchased this textbook as a course requirement, and am still irritated by the expenditure."
3,Great until it broke!!!,"We recently purchased this from our local Target store. I really enjoy the ease of use! Unfortunately after only two weeks it is dead. The water wont go into the ""carafe"". The bottom heating element works but the water stays cold and doesnt move. Today is Saturday so I will have to wait until Monday to contact customer service. If they will send a replacement I will try it one more time and just suffer through with my press pot in the meantime (major inconvenience with Thanksgiving next week)!!! I suggest if you buy this to tuck the box and receipt away in a closet so you can easily return it to the store when and if it dies."
1,"The most useless, unhelpful, poorly written math book ever!",I wasted over $100 on this aweful Calculus textbook. There is no way you can read this book without a Calculus teacher/tutor in the same room and learn anything. This book was obviously not tested on students. It does not provide even 10% enough examples to help one solve most of the exercises.
4,Revisiting my youth,"First read the Swift series in my teen years, which was not yesterday. Reread this as I had forgotten what they were like. It is a good read for the target market of YA's and a pleasant and brief distraction for an adult."
2,Too much bragging,Spent too much time bragging about her clients and her accomplishments and too little time offering helpful advice.
1,Dreadful,Hate the hero (the philandering dog).Hate the heroine (completely unconvincing).Bailed very early.Yeesh.
5,"Fun, lovely story with fantastic illustrations","This is a sweet story with beautiful illustrations. My twins have been enjoying listening to me read it to them since they were about 6 months, and all three of us still enjoy it and will likely continue for many years."
4,Good service,"The service was ok, it took more days than I expected , the box was not sealed.Overall was ok !!!!"
3,Inventory Confusion,"The comforter thickness is good, the pillows are cute. The fabric is so-so. Given these attributes, $30 plus free shipping is a decent deal, not the retail $340.The bad thing is I ordered a Beige and received Gold. The item has no mark to indicate what color it is. But comparing the pictures (Gold and Beige) to the item I received, it's definitely not Beige and I asked several people's opinion.I've contact customer service. This will test Amazon's service on a discounted item."
2,Magellan Support less than satisfactory,I received my Maestro 3140 over a month ago which was delivered with a faulty car adapter and a CD with a program on it no one can figure out how to use. I have contacted Magellan's customer service 4 times now. They keep promising to ship out a new adapter in 3-4 days. That was a month ago. I hope people who own these units don't ever have to have help from customer service - they won't get any. My unit is being shipped back asap. Garmin's receive much better reviews.
1,don't waste time and $-look further,This is basically an out-dated carb counter-many new food items are NOT listed-like no Greek yogurts or other newer specialty items-only about 4 older fast food restuarants are listed and their foods listed are very limited. There are better carb counters out there-keep looking. I ordered 2 so I could always have one close-big disappointment
4,"""Hey what's not to like""","This one has it all and then some, ""Horse With No Name,"" ""Sandman,"" ""I Need You,"" ""Everyone I Meet Is From California,"" and ""Ventura Highway,"" just to name a few. Go with it...you'll be glad you did!"
4,Decent...,"I use it as backlighting for my desk when I'm writing code at night (eases eye strain). It works, but the plastic is very stiff and difficult to hang properly if you aren't going to secure it with something permanent (read: brackets and/or staples/nails). I will buy it again for my other desk."
4,Ted,"This movie is not for everyone,, rather raunchy,, but very funny,, rated R, did enjoy it the second time around."
4,so nice...,"This is a very nice collection. If you're a huge Mel Torme fan, this might be a 5 star rating. Like the other ""Spotlight On..."" CDs, these are very polished studio recordings offering a wide range of the artist's talents, but I particularly enjoy hearing his voice with the big band sound on this CD."
4,1001 Arabian Nights--Tales,This book exposes the 1001 Arabian nights for what they are--spell binding tales from the Middle East!Good story book.
3,Not quite how i thought it would end!,"I read this book recently and was just enthralled with it. I really liked the story of a haunted school. That was till i got to the ending. you think its a horror novel till the end. to me it was more like a sci-fi story. It was a good story, just not scary!"
4,Another in a Justly Popular Series,"I suppose this can be considered an update of perception a decade down the road from its publication and review by Amazon readers. This is not among the best of the series, but, if like I, you have come to like visiting the people at the Temple, idiosyncrasies and all, it will prove pleasing. The Mystery Question is, what is going on at the Health Ranch which is marketing for the Mistress (or Tyrant_) of Temple affairs, a diet matzoball. In the process of digging up the answers, Ruby, the former Rabbi's wife, runs into all sorts of dilemmas. In the Temple, of course, there are the usual amusing goings-on.To take off on a point by another reviewer, you don't have to be Jewish to like the book and its characters, you can be Jewish and dislike them. Most general readers of what has come to be called ""cozies"" should find this good light entertainment."
1,Crap,"Made a single pot of coffee and water started leaking out of the cold water reservoir through the base of the machine and all over the counter.Nothing obvious; no cracks, holes or any other visible leak points -- but the water just poured through the machine and out the bottom.Unfortunately, I had already discarded the box -- so no returns."
3,Not to die for,"The cookie is tasty, but from a previous reviewer, I had expected to be in heaven over the fudge. Unfortunately it was a big let down, not enough deep chocolate taste, although rich."
5,Tunnel of Greatness,"If you are lookin for an album with rockin tunes than this not the album to get. This is the type of album that makes it a risky move on an artist who just had a lot of hits on his previous record. He still had two top ten hits. Brilliant Disguise and the title track. A couple of the songs he does by himself. Aint Got You, My Happy Valentine, Cautious Man and One Step Up he does byself, well, One Step Up does have backup vocals by his future wife. It is also the last album he used the E Street Band untill the 2002 album The Rising. Me personally, This my favorite bruce album. The song WALK LIKE A MAN is a song about a long obsession with his father, Aint Got You self-consious look about being a rock star. ONE STEP UP, TWO FACES, BRILLIANT DISGUISE AND TUNNEL OF LOVE ARE ABOUT reflections of his trouble marriage"
4,great pillow,"I got this pillow for my sister who is 5+ months pregnant, she has been sleeping much better and is very happy to have received a product that actually provides comfort."
2,A faker with no respect for the underground.,"Though ""Rodan"" may have a somewhat original flow...no wait....I take that back...he sounds like RBL with a hangover...anyway - how in the hell are you going to take the name ""Rodan"" when you know damn well a great, if not GODLY band has taken the name first. Hip hop is hip hop. Indie is indie. But for God's sake, if you're going to try to be original, then at least start with an original name.One thumb down."
3,Not so sure,"Please try it for yourself, but from my experience and what i have read here, it would be nice if it worked for at least somebody that reviewed it. i used the convert from dvi-d to dvi-i off my laptop to this dvi-i to rca, no luck"
5,So helpful & informative!,"Learned the simplest things I'd never thought of, so effective. Makes my dog and me even happier in our life together!"
4,Good and entertaining but missing ending,it was all cool when goku turned super saiyan and was beating frezia pretty bad. It was all great until I got to the end of the book and frezia was still alive!! I had to read volume 12 to see the end of frezia. That cost me another 7.95.
1,Not compatible with many phones,"I could not tell from the product description that this would not work with my daughers phone. Waste of $20. This product needs to have a very clear description of supported phones on it. You cant tell until you install which then invalidates the returns policy for the software. Very poor.When buying, it was not clear that this was being delivered by another merchant with different return policy. Now the returns process is a pain. I wanted to buy all my Christmas gifts early from Amazon, not some other vendor because I want their return policies. Amazon need to make it much clearer that you are leaving their web site when you do so. Unless you look carefully it all looks like Amazon branded until the package arrives. Amazon should deal with returns when its them that take the money. I have used Amazon and been very happy for years but this has been the first bad experience. Now I'll think twice about where to buy."
5,Vale Mike Seeger,"This video of the New lost City Ramblers is s fitting tribute to the late Mike Seeger, Musician, Musicologist and fine human being.This DVD is a must-have for all devotees of traditional old-time music, collected and presented by 4 excellent multi-instrumentalists."
2,Everyday Meals for Whom?,"Perhaps, I was thinking wrongly, but when I think of everyday meals, I don't think of the recipes that are included in this book. I was looking forward to recipes that helped me fix many of things I already fix in a healthier way. Instead, I consider most of the recipes in this book to be fancy (things I might use for special occasions). Though I'm sure the recipes are wonderful (I haven't tried any yet), this is just not what I was expecting from the title."
3,A little long,"Started out very good and kept you interested, but I think somewhere along the way it lost something. It took me to long to watch. Costumes and sets were great, but got boring towards the end."
3,not as good as the Yoshiesque mixes or Penetrate Deeper,"Sharam and Ali return to GU with their second mix. Following on the quite lackluster Moscow (i'd give it 1.5 stars), which was sprinkled with some decent tracks (Word Unspoken and Rise as two examples), but at the same time cluttered with boring fare like Dido, iio, Fatboy Slim and Markus Schultz, this is definitely an improvement. Toronto is housier and groovier than the boys first GU.The first disc is overall very good and will garner repeat listens. The second disc, however, is disjointed in flow. I suppose it's worth the price if you're a GU listener who's been around since Tony de Vit's Tel Aviv and want to keep your collection complete. But, if you don't own Yoshiesque 1 (or Yoshi 2 to a lesser extent) or Penetrate Deeper (which is being re-released in Spetember of this year), then get these two first. I have all of Deep Dish's commercial work and these are my favorites."
5,The good one,"This is an excellent book for those starting to play guitar; easy to follow, good technique and a variety of themes."
5,Living Proof---movie of hope.,"An excellent true story of drug research for breast cancer. It's enlightening as to all the battles fought in cancer research and the lives involved, lost and saved. Highly recommended."
2,Skip this one,"I'm a certified sommelier , and if you're looking for a introductory wine book, you can do much better than this. It's organization of topics is awkward and unintuitive. The authors bias towards American (especially California) wine is patently obvious. Wine for Dummies and The Wine Bible are both much better than this book. There are also a few glaring (if you know wine) errors. Also, on a literary note, it's not particularly well written. Major pass."
4,mice get stuck in it,it's fine it kills mice what do you wnat me to say the reason no one wants to do this is we don't have time to do such a long text box.
4,Not an album that does her justice,"Timi was probably thegreatest white soul singer who ever lived.She unfortunately suffered from throat cancer for a very long time, and I believe this was recorded when she still wasn't really well enough to hit those wonderful notes that she once did, but the emotion is still there. Her voice sounds much deeper, but still very warm.This album is really for dedicated fans, and not one for first time listeners to her. I say this not to be critical, as I am one of her greatest admirers having been buying her music since 1961.This lady suffered from dreadful promotion, and should have been a huge star. Mike Rossiter UK"
5,Baker Street CD,"Cool Baker Street CD, I have heard these songs on the radio for years, and finally have them on CD. Crank it on some Bose speakers and appreciate the full range of the tunes. Some of these songs have more impact than songs from really heavy bands, because the music is believable and not too abstract. Cool CD!... Cheers Amazon!!"
1,Waste of my money,"I was very sorry to have spent nearly $50 of my hard-earned cash on this. I felt that the first (introductory) DVD was impossible to follow, so gave up. Also, the editing style is extremely annoying -- the ""wipe"" transitions between segments made me motion sick. I wasted my money -- don't waste yours."
3,Must read.,"Must read. However, there are sections that flow with sections that lack coherence. Gives people that read this novel a true depiction of the hopelessness many blacks felt during Jim crow south."
1,"Locks up computer, cumbersome software","Installing the software for this USB adapter causes Windows XP home to lock-up continuously (to the point where you have to use the power button to shut the computer down). Multiple attempts to uninstall and reinstall yielded the same resutls. Also, the included software (which you must utilize), is slow and cumbersome. The US Robotics MaxG router is great, but buy a Netgear or Linksys USB adapter instead of this one and save yourself a lot of frustraton."
1,Total Loss,"Very disappointed in this product. The earphones are large and don't stay in the ears. The vertical support is flimsy so offers no structure to keep in the ear, wore it once and now it is trash. NO!"
5,"IF THERE WAS A 10 STAR RATING, THIS IS IT!!!",wow wow wow! this cd/dvd set is a DEAL! I 'm totally engrossed with it now...this is the one to buy if you want this awesome musical experience..My mom always loved him ..and NOW I DO! Wow !bringit on
4,Hollywood Book of Death,"I wanted to know more and now I do. I find myself quoting parts of this book to my friends and family. Like "" Did you know that so and so or he/she died...."" I don't know if they think I am interesting but at least I now have more to talk about. I have read several Parish Hollywood books and they tend to repeat the same subject matter and deal with some stars I've never heard of but all in all it's an enjoyable and easy read."
5,"Games, Stories",I love reading and doing the games/puzzles with my 5 and 7 year old. The games actually build spatial and reasoning skills in a non stressful way.
5,its too good,"I did not find any book on programming which could be used on any language without much difficulty. Its presents the logic exactly the way I like - ""Discover your way to the solution!"""
3,Good - but some rough spots,"This makes the bibliography process easier, however if you need to delete references or change them around while writing, the program can give you a big hassle. I've had a couple of situations that ended with me having to type my own bibliography up by hand because the program wouldn't let me change what I needed to change. I also find that t seems to be fussier about making changes when using APA format than when using JAMA or NEJM formats."
5,I love ALL AHF CDs thus far!,"I just saw these guys play live (Feb 2005; opening band for Bowling for Soup in Burlington VT), and I can NOT believe that I had never heard them before. They rocked the place, and I bought all their CDs the very next day. Not only was their show great, but they even hung around afterward, to talk with fans and sign CDs, shirts, etc. Totally cool. My favorites on this particular CD are ""Art of Losing,"" ""Breakup Song,"" ""Nothing Left to Lose,"" ""The Gold Rush,"" and ""Built for Speed"" (when you have that many favorites off of one CD, you know it's a good one!). Their new CD ""Hearts on Parade"" will be released by Maverick in April 2005 - and I highly recommend that one too (based on a pre-release EP we bought at the show). And don't miss the chance to see them perform live if you can."
5,This was the scary movie of the 90's!!!,"If you watch horror movies from the 70's and 80's, like ""Carrie"", ""The Amityville Horror"" or ""Prom Night"", they still will scare you. But you could not make a horror movie like that nowadays with the same effect. Until Wes Craven, created the new type of horror movies. He started it in the 70's with ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" and did it again with ""Scream"". ""Scream"" has become one the most original and most scariest movie to date. An all star cast, led by talented Neve Cambell, made this thriller a definate must see and is the beginning of future classic horror movies."
3,"Adequate, but not what Revere used to be.","My parents had Revereware when I was growing up. The pots and pans were very high quality and designed to last a lifetime. The ones I just bought will do the job, but they are nowhere near the quality I remember. They are well made, but thin, and they will probably last me 10 years, except for the non-stick fry pan. That will be worn out in a year or two."
2,They did terrible,"When it first came out i thought it looked cool so i got it.i found it very fun in the first couple levels, but when i got to the point were i fought the monster guy, it got very hard.since then i got to the second place were you fight for the second mask... ...I got to that level almost a year ago.unless you want a hard game, DO NOT GET RAYMAN 2!it's the worst game i ever saw."
1,Very disappointing. Far too long and rambling.,"I found this book very boring. The characters were all social misfits of various levels of society. At the end of the book Tom Wolfe had realised that the book was too long so he suddenly had to bring all the characters together, so the ending was all of a sudden there! It was very repetitive in the descriptive passages. I was so glad to be done with this book and I cannot find anything about it to praise."
4,Alfred's Group Piano,"The book overall is okay..the cd that comes along with it, for a very beginner goes along a little fast. Other than that the book is good for beginners and helps you to advance."
4,Not His Best - Still A Good Read!,"I agree....2 stars for the main story, 5 stars for the short stories.I just finished the book last night. I did enjoy the short stories more than the main story that seemed very contrived and strained to pull it all together. However, that said, a Chuck book is better than 90% of anything out there.This is no Fight Club or Choke (my two favorites from Chuck) but this book will please his loyal fans."
2,Both good and bad.,"While ""Tides"", by Scott Mackay was an intriguing book, I was surprised by the simplicity of the writing. It seemed the author kept repeating the same phrases, for example writing the phrase ""cache of weapons"" twice in the same paragraph. I also found it a bit amazing that Hab, the main character, invented submersible ships and handguns, circumnavigated the globe, AND created a democracy from a former monarchy.But, ""Tides"" was suspenseful and presented interesting ideas. Finding a balance between all truth and all lies seems relevant to our own world today."
2,What's the deal?,Dead bodies everywhere reminds me of how much this cd stinks. the scratchy sound and annoying beat were enough to make me scream! and the metal/rap thing just dosn't sound good at all.
3,OK - but could be better,"When I first received this, I thought it was GREAT. And it was, while my baby was an infant and would deep sleep every single time. I wished that it would have an option to run continously. The two timer settings are not long enough. Now that she is 7 months old, her naps during the day are not as ""deep"" and so as soon as the sound goes off after 45 minutes, she wakes up, because it's so abrupt. There is no fading of the sound. And as one other review mentioned, it has begun to short circuit now - even with a battery change. I have just recently bought (to replace it) the Graco sound machine. It's small and offers a variety of white noises and offers a timer OR to run all night. And in our small house, running all night is a must."
5,i love this show,Very excited to hear season 2 is coming out. I loved watching season 1 dvd's but it was so bitter sweet because I didn't think anymore dvd's would be made. Please release the 3rd season ASAP- it was my fav. of the three.I protested ABC when the show was cancelled and I'm really grateful for these dvd releases. can't wait til August!UPDATE: Just got my Second Season Today- Can't wait to watch it. (august 26th)
2,This diet is to high in fat and it does not work.,I found this book to be loaded with recipes with tons of fat. Snacking on nuts and cheese is not a good way to loose weight. In fact i have been on it a week and my clothes feel snug. This plan does not work. I am going back to low fat eating.
1,Caused More Harm Than Good,"This protein treatment caused more breakage in areas that had issues, and strengthened already healthy parts of my hair. I did not need more strength added to already healthy areas, I needed the more brittle areas to be more stable. My hair is fine but thick and can get damage easily. I have to color it every 3-6 months with a natural hair product (Naturtint) because it gets damaged easily. I had heard that this works best for black hair, however I was told it's also great if you are white, but it doesn't seem the case after reading other reviews with similar problems. I have used Nexxus in the past as well as Joco and both helped add more stability to my hair, but after using this two-step treatment exactly as the instructions read, my hair has more split ends and breakage than ever before. I will definitely not be using it again and I do not recommend it to other people with similar hair to mine."
3,cam lock bullet puller,"I can find nowhere on this products advertisement where they tell you it is not complete, and therefore useless, without the collet specific to the bullet caliber you wish to pull.So when you order this product, it come incomplete, and therefore useless without one of i think 20 or so different sized collets. And to make matters worse, amazon does not carry ANY of the collets for this product, and out of 25 gun websites i know of i could not find the collets listed for sale anywhere.So impossible to accurately rate a product that is incomplete and therefore useless to you. I suppose ""waste of money"" would be my review"
5,I luv this book,I was really surprised by this book. I was expecting the usually and I was mistaken. I luv how he showed the good and bad side of gangs. You will have so many emotions while reading this book. If you luv urban fiction this is a must have book. I will 4ever be a fan of K'Wan now. Get the sequel too.
2,Didn't work for me. Maybe you.,"I did a month supply and did not see any improvement or feel different. I did not change my diet at all, other than adding the Primal Defense each day, and I experienced no weight loss, energy boost, superhuman powers or even a wholesome feeling. Others may get results, but it did nothing for me. I don't feel ripped off, as others had at least some results and I took my chances."
4,VERY NICE!,"WE PURCHASED THIS FOR OUR 2 LITTLE GUYS. THE YOUNGEST IS ALWAYS CURIOUS, I WAS AFRAID HE WOULD TRY TO CHEW HIS WAY OUT. IF HE GETS MAD FOR BEING IN TO LONG, HE LIKES TO CHEW THINGS. HE HAS NOT TRIED TO CHEW ON THIS AT ALL. GREAT PRODUCT I WOULD RECOMMEND IT HIGHLY. IT IS VERY ATTRACTIVE AND NOT AN EYE SORE LIKE SOME OF THEM CAN BE"
4,Norelco SpeedXL,The quiet shave and ease of cleaning this unit are great! The charge lasts for about two weeks during normal use and the comfort of the shave is very nice after a couple of days for your face to get used to the change from a foil razor.The only thing keeping it from a 5 star rating for me is the closeness of the cut. It is not as quite close cutting as my Braun was but the other things outweigh the difference.
2,Big Disk lost its Partition Info,"After some months of reliable operation, I powered up my triple interface LaCie Big Disk 500 gb and it had lost all the partition information. Partition Magic and Norton were no help. Since it wasn't my only copy, I didn't lose data, but it sure make me cautious about relying on this disk again. I was using a Dell and an Orange Micro USB2/firewire 400 card. Both interfaces worked equally well before, and neither after losing the partition.I'm not sure I could recommend using this drive in any application that didn't have reliable frequent backups on other media."
2,Old Spice,"I like Dynasty Chinese Five Spice as a product. I use it in stir fry. It is a strong flavoring that works well for me since I reduce my sodium intake. I wasn't able to find it locally when I ran out, so I decided to buy the 6 pack choice thinking it should last for a year and a half or so. In this case, the spices all came with a best used by 12/15/12 date.. 4 months only. I got.. old(er) spice. Disappointing."
2,"Okay but ""Canyon"" not good for sound","This was an ""OK"" concert; BUT out in the Red Rock canyon; the sound is displaced. The orchestra sound was just fine; but the Moody Blues themselves were ""not great"" to put it mildly. I AM A HUGE MOODY BLUES FAN; BUT THIS DVD IS NOT THE ONE YOU WANT."
4,Good,"I liked this book because it was organized to give different variations to the different card games in an organized fashion. Because of this feature, I have already used the book a number of times."
1,water for elephants not for me,I dislike strange sexual behavior but most of all I hate killing and mistreatment of animals and other humans. I just didn't look into the book far enough to realize these things were written about.
5,Review by one of the prosecutors,"As one of the prosecutors in the case, my review may be on the biased side, but I think John Phillips did a great job on this book. Somehow he made it accurate and entertaining at the same time. Having read John's articles in Car and Driver long before I ever met him, I always enjoyed his humorous writing style. After meeting him during the trial and afterwards, I appreciated both his writing and his humor even more. It was a very interesting case to investigate and try in court, but the book was entertaining even to me. Some of our witnesses opened up to him with more information after the trial was over. I hope anyone who reads this book will have an appreciation of the inside view of what seems like an incredible fraud scheme but is actually ""sad but true."" I know anyone who reads it will be entertained.Dan Stewart"
1,Poor customer support,"When I first bought this vacuum I thought I had a good product. Then the belt broke and I found I had to send off for a new belt. Parts are not carried in the stores. Then after waiting a month for the new belt to arrive, I had to call their customer support repeatedly to ever get the darn thing delivered. Then they delivered one belt instead of the two I had ordered and paid for. A week later one of the wheels fell off the vacuum cleaner. I went to Wal-Mart and bought a Hoover."
3,The photos are so small,"The photos in this photo diary is quite small - usually put three in half page, and the text is so big for those small photos. -> It not so comfortable to read a book in this layout.Also, most photos are not sharp."
5,Christmas in Camelot,"A great title in a long list of great, series books! As a third grade teacher, I cannot recommend these books enough! The repetition or similarity of themes, characters, and plot make it very easy for children to utilize comprehension strategies. They can easily predict what will happen, understand the characters, and thoroughly enjoy the stories! YEAH!"
3,A brilliant view of recent New York history,"I'm from New York and think it's one of the greatest cities in the world.This video is very realistic. I lived in New York while the World Trade Center was being planned and built. This video really captures a lot of the spirit of the times. A lot of people don't realize that the World Trade Center was a near total financial disaster when it opened and was considered by many a giant mistake. New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller saved the day by moving a lot of New York state offices into the complex.Paradoxically, the World Trade Center represented little of the ""free enterprise"" vision that many see as gospel today. It was the creation of a government agency, the Port Authority - not free enterprise.Nevertheless, I think it was a big plus for New York, and it eventually became a financial success."
5,funny,funny movie Good one! have not seen a funny one like this on a while watch this movie and you will agree
1,Worst Movie Ever Made - But it's so FUNNY!!!,"Not to be mistaken with Madonna's Truth or Dare which is also bad but not as funny. This story centres around a man who for some reason ends up plaing Truth or Dare out in the woods with a large breasted hitch hiker and is unable to JUST SAY NO!, when it comes to the dare part of the game.He ends up in a mental institution, after his wife cheats on him..? Doesn't make sense....I know....plays Truth or Dare with some inmates, pulling weapons out of God knows where....the whole movie is like this. In the hospital he magically produces a grenade, a bowie knife, and a gun....when he breaks out of the hospital the car he steals is loaded with a shot gun, an axe, a chainsaw and nunchucks....why??? Who's car was this. And for some reason that only the movie makers can explain, for half the movie the killer is wearing a ""bronze"" mask...the plastic moves in and out when he breaths!!!So funny! If you are a fan of cheese, buy it, rent it, love it!It has no equal."
1,not for commercial use,"this unit is too slow on batteries, will not print a journal receipt, and the power adapter that came with it is a universal adapter so you need to set the voltage, and it did not work. a change box is easier."
1,whistler XTR-140 Laser/Radar Detector with Exclusive Twin Alert Periscope,I dont like it the police is next to you and the thing never goes off I suggest that no ever buy this.
4,Great read!,"Bethany Cole is just a normal girl living in Greenleaf, Pennsylvania> and then weird, unexplainable things start happening. Her mother> can't stop crying and her dad gets them all into the car to drive> off to a relative Bethany has never heard of in her whole life.> Bethany's surroundings get even hazier as her dad mentions an> unknown girl ""she must know about"" -- Elizabeth. In this> breathtaking novel, Haddix's foreshadowing and climactic twists are> perfect. With every chapter, she'll have you hungry for more. So if> you love twists and surprises, then ""Double Identity"" is the right> book for you! -- Alex Satola"
4,its OK.....,"This game is pretty fun although.... theres one down side its the same adzact thing as madden 2002! the players look the same,run the same,tackle the same everythings the same although its awesome to juke and laterall the ball but... graphics 4.5,fun factor 3.5,sound 5.0, its awesome to hear the crunch and the players grunt,control 4.0 If you have the game madden 2002 for pc,ps2 or anything I advise you not to buy this game...but NCAA GameBreaker 2003 is a much better investment"
5,Good quality cable,"It's hard to write a review of Ethernet cables since there's really only one thing they can do. Knowing that, these cables do their assigned task very well. It provides a solid connection between my computer and cable modem, with no issues to speak of."
3,"Good writing, but not relateable","As the child of holocaust survivors I thought I would find myself in these pages, but didn't. Then, I remind myself this is fiction, so, the author does have room to invent. The writing is good, but the story didn't capture me."
1,Model Powers off by Itself!,Model powers off by itself every day. Takes 4 minutes to get it back on! Do not buy any tv that is not internet ready to get firmware updates to fix glitches like this!
1,Waste of Time,Shut it off half way through. Stupid story lines and an insult to anyone who enjoys Sherlock Holmes stories. Wasted my money
2,"Lots of Aimless Angst, But Meh. Nothing Stellar.","I loved the movie, but the book... meh. Didn't blow me away. I keep hearing about how much more awesome it is than the screen adaptation, but I just found it to be a little too boring. Besides, the author said in an interview that he liked the movie's ending over his own. HINT: It's never good when the author prefers the movie."
5,Nice alternative to a high chair!,We got this chair when my son was born. We already had the Healthy Care High Chair (which I highly recommend also) for my daughter. We decided to get the booster seat for my daughter and give my son the high chair instead of buying another high chair (my kids are not quite 11 mos apart). What a good investment! It's nice to have something so compact to take places with us if need be. My daughter can sit right up at the table with us and we can strap her in (a must--or else she's on the table!) My only complaint is that the tray insert pops out to easily. I gave up trying to use it because she pops it out and the food goes right on the floor! Other than that it is great!
3,"Good product, but messy","This is a good product, but putting it in a tub is messy! It's really creamy and just gets everywhere. I ended up getting a plastic spoon and scooping it out onto a cotton round. This product is easier in a tube. Other than that- it's great for preventing diaper rash."
1,IS THERE A PLACE FOR MINUS STARS?,"If ""Love"" continues to do movies like this, and even have the gall to help produce them, she'll forever remain irrelevant and trite as a movie star. She's got talent potential. What she does NOT have is any sense. As far as this movie is concerned, don't bother to go there. I wish I hadn't. Poor writing. Poor plot. Poor you, if you watch it. You've been warned."
3,Good trimmer with bad battery,"This trimmer is a cordless unit that requires you to fully drain the battery before recharging it again. This is very inconvenient and I would have prefered a corded unit to this. Other than that, it's very inexpensive, versatile, and works well."
3,The Great and the bad,"I really love this camera. I got it two years ago for christmas, and I can't explain how much I love this thing! The only problems I have are that its impossible to take pictures indoors. Like at a concert or graduation or something like that. And the battery life sucks. But if you purchase rechargable batteries, it works much better."
5,great entertaining,loved this movie great for all ages very touching to the heart. could watch it again when usually I watch movies only 1 time.
2,"Beautiful Music, great idea, pendantic drivel","Love the idea of this movie, but I completely agree with the people who have pointed out that it is is a series of smug sermons on the injustices of the past. Yes, mountain people were exploited and women were oppressed but in this movie they all have great skin, teeth and access to hair mousse. I was especially irked with the scene where the two women were caught kissing in the woods. Lesbians or ""spinsters"" from that era would never, ever ever have taken such a risk because they knew the terrible consequences if they were caught. That's opression for you. This movie (despite a great effort from the cast) was contrived and patronizing - even though I agree with most of its politics. If you want to immerse yourself in the culture, just get the Songcatcher II CD. Those who voted for this at sundance were probably voting for the music and the message, not the movie."
3,Okay. Do not recommend for referencing. need good class notes.,"I bought this book because it was a requirement to have for the class. Could rarely ever reference it or rely on it for understanding. I'm not sure what it is in particular but I wasn't a big fan of the presentation. I in all honestly used it primarily for assigned problems and that's it. good thing is as always, price on amazon beats the bookstore price."
4,The squirrels are finally stymied!,"The blackbirds on the other hand have figured this thing out.The previous ""squirrel proof"" bird feeder that we had offered daily proof that it could feed squirrels up to and including the varmints actually climbing inside of the thing. The squirrels don't even try with this one. They hang around underneath and clean up what falls.Blackbirds and Jays can on the other hand feed on this unit if they do so one at a time. Who would have thought they could learn to be so polite?Nonetheless the feeder works great overall."
1,bad transaction,"This was clearly advertised as a set of 12 at the time I purchased, as the seller acknowledged, but they refused to honor that ad, saying it was a mistake. I won't be doing further business with them and recommend other buyers beware unless and until they get a different philosophy of customer service."
3,Yes and No,"Yes it worked as intended for a little while. No it doesn't fool everybody, because it was stolen within 6 Mo's!"
1,Upset,They sent me a tainted version of the cologne. It smells horrible and the liquid appears darker than it normally should be. Worst part is I can't return it. What a waste of $20!
1,It doesn't even make a good doorstop!,I have worked with Laplink 95/3.1 and had a very good experience. So when upgrading my computer and operating program this was a natural to select for file transfer to the new computer. I spent many frustrating hours attempting to make it work. Requests to the on line help generated a reference to an on line article that was of no help. I have given up. This software would not recognize a connection with the provided cable between a Windows 98 Pentium II to a XP Home Edition Pentium IV.
1,Audio is Always OUT OF SYNC,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT ... files generated have horribly out of sync audio and El Gato has no fix for it. Do your own research and you will find out that this product does not work as advertised.
5,Interested in weird things going on?,Here's a movie to wet your whistle and get you to thinking about things in a different light. You'll next visit the rest of the Watchers series. Truly enjoyed the time spent with family members watching the Watchers.
2,bear's a wimp- he should've done that to THEIR faces,"the title of this message sums it up. All 70's-80's horror flicks suck big time. This bear should have done that to THIER faces he is a bear after all. Grizzly bears(esp mutant ones) can pretty much win every fight and would maim the victim eventually. A human cutting up a bear with a knife and drowning it? c'mon, man! Watch ""Grizzly"" instead. Yeah it's early 70's feldercarbon, but it is very disturbing to the eye(s)."
3,SMALLER SIZES ARE AVAILABLE!!,"Most websites have only the 9' and longer sizes shown as available. This is erroneous! Sizes as small as 3' long are made. I didn't know this until receipt of the product bought, and the package was opened. My need is the 3' length, not 9'! So now I'm stuck with a product I don't need, and have to buy direct from the mfr. to get the size I really need. This is a great dis-service to we consumers."
2,So-so,I love chick-lit and this book was just average. It took me a really long time to read because it was a book I could easily put down.
4,One of the BEST American Rock bands! A very good compilation of their Hits!,"Even when my Rock music feedback is mainly based on British ""Classic"" and ""Heavy Metal"" Rock (i.e. Yes, ELP, Genesis, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Uriah Heep, Jethro Tull et al), I must admit that Bon Jovi is, certainly, ONE OF THE BEST ROCK BANDS EVER (Made in America)!!!This album includes almost every known major ""Hit"" of this talented Band.No loss for your Rock collection!"
5,Riverdance,I bought this as a present for my sister. She loves the Celtic dancing. She loved the music and dancing!
5,great insight and information for parents and students,"The Gap Year Advantage is the most comprehensive and useful book about the benefits and realities of the Gap Year experience. As the parent of a student who did a gap year, we would have better prepared having read this book. Can't recommend it more highly."
1,Avoid if at all possible,"This book is a nightmare. There is nothing fundamental about the statistics within this book. The author provides very few examples of how to work through a problem. Frequently, the author is condescending, and he has a lot of irrelevant information. Several statistics professors at my university have looked at this book when I have gone to them for help, and they are amazed at how poorly the book is written. The questions at the end of each chapter require knowledge that the author has not begun to explain, so students have zero concept of how to solve a problem. Teachers who use this book should be ashamed! Also, many of the website links do not work, so the necessary resources are not available! This book is too expensive to be this poorly put together!"
2,New Turok game lacks punch of series,"The Turok series is a classic for n-64, but the series has become stagent. Turok 3 lacks the weapons and levels that the other two turoks had. What happended to dinosaurs? You'll see muntant bloodsucking leaches than you will dinosaurs. The producers of this game promised better multiplayer than rage wars. Boy were they wrong. This game also has little replay abilty.I recommend that you should rent it instead of buying it."
3,Not as exciting as I'd hoped,"My 10-month old loves her Alphabet Drum so I figured these would be fun for her as well. She likes the one that just shakes, but the one with the activities doesn't do a thing for her. She has very little interest in them..."
3,If you want only pass an examination.,"This book is a good summary of basic biostatistics and epidemiology, but only that. If you want more deep please look in other books."
4,Quality Printer,"It is an excellent idea to have all the computers in your house share one printer. Installation was very easy, just plugged it into one of the wired ports on the wireless router and had all the PCs in the house printing to it. It is a very good quality for the price!"
2,Weak Feel Good,"Weak story, tries to be ""feel Good"" buy just feels tired.I like Corbin Bermsen , I hope future efforts provide nore suspense"
2,Lost in translation,"I personally love this toy, but my 6 mo old... well, she just looks at it, spins the wheels, and that's it. Maybe she's not that stage to actually touch the letters yet. After about 4-5 spins, she loses interest.However, ultimately, I believe that she'll learn to love it. And I may try to detach the ball from its cradle to see if it make a difference. But she's not walking yet either, so it's hard to tell how durable it is if she doesn't drop it.The ""ABCDEFG..."" song becomes very repetitive if she doesn't spin it continuously- it starts over from the beginning otherwise... annoying for adults! Why didn't the egineers make it continue from there on??!One nice feature is that every letter has a different, albeit short, song that it plays in the music setting. It doesn't become old like many toys."
5,Every Citizen Should Be Familiar With The Contents!,"This book has gathered together in one convenient place an impressive collection of letters, documents, speeches and essays which clearly illustrate the content of the Founders' souls. This book should be read by every American who considers him or herself a responsible adult. Notice the book is not called 'Republicans Will Eat Your Baby!', nor is it called 'Liberals Posessed By Demons, Communists'. It is aimed at AMERICANS, and that is how we'd better start seeing ourselves if we're ever going to wise up. This Red State/Blue State divisiveness will solve nothing; let's all agree to lay down our weapons and reasonably discuss ways to overcome the problems that are affecting all Americans! Let's all take a breather while refreshing our memories on what this country is really all about! I urge you as my fellow citizen to take the time to consider what this nation really means to YOU."
1,Nice Little Budget System? HA!,"I've read all of the reviews, and while I can see both sides of the coin, be aware that sure ""it's a nice little budget system"" IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO REPLACE IT NEXT YEAR. If you want to spend $220 PER year on a home entertainment system, that's fine. After purchasing the system and being told by customer service after 10 months ""send us $200 and we'll send you a new unit"" rather than offering any type of repair - I'll shop elsewhere for my system. In this instance, you get what you pay for."
3,Fun and funky,"Are these guys English? Good follow up to 'Its great,.."" but are these guys straight? Ryder's mob does it again with thick and groovy sounds strung around strange (cryptic?) lyrics. From the get go, you ears are warped into the minds of Black Grape; funky bass, offbeat lyrics, asymetrical guitars and sampling (are those turntables?) and you either enjoy the chaotic joy of being sloppy and baggy or you look for the quickest way out. Thumbs up for creativity; thumbs down for engineering, sometimes it does blend to mush but doesn't always at three a.m.?"
5,Sophisticated and Smart,"the Weakerthans' 3rd album is simply a joy to listen to. The music is not too hard and almost poppy, but in a sophisticated way. The lyrics are again superb. Not the stupid love songs but songs with actual ideas and smart language tricks.My favorite song is 'One Great City!' about their hometown of Winnipeg. I guess a city you love to hate."
2,Flash mx 2004 accelerated,"This book is not what you want, you don't learn much as most of the guides are half done on an enclosed CD. Also, it does not cover much on action script, which i believe is one of the main aspects of Flash Mx. There are better books out there that teach you to create flash objects from scratch (meaning you won't end up in a confused mess thinking, how did they do that). on the plus, the book is clear, well presented and a few of the projects are easy to follow. in my opinion there are better books on the market."
5,Life saver,"I looked for these movie for so long couldn't find it anywhere in stores im so glad for resources like Amazon, quality items at discounted prizes:)."
2,"Good concept, not good coffee!","I purchased one of these for my office and although coffee is hot, it has a weird taste. I also find grinds in my coffee everywhere. I'm going to purchase a small coffee maker with regular filters to replace this item. The coffee just doesn't taste the same as I make in my home coffee maker. Its a dissapointment."
1,Why are we disappointed?,"for my review, I'm re-posting a response to the questions; ""How can we be disappointed when we love the movies in the theaters?"" & ""Are we just hard to please?""I agree with the reviews. Most who have watch the extended version a few times will be disappointed. To answer the question ...how can we be disappointed when we we thrilled when we saw it in the theaters?If you have ice cream for the first time it taste great. You then have ice cream with strawberries or hot fudge on top.... you are then promised a special treat for your birthday... you are going out for ice cream! ...you are then told you can only have the vanilla even though they have the other flavors right behind the counter... yes vanilla ice cream is still great and yes there will be some who will prefer the plain vanilla... but you still may be disappointed.what if they were to release the blu-ray version with great picture but only stereo or mono sound? Would we still be hard to please?"
5,Good Quality,Cord seems to be well made. My last one failed at the connection. It was constantly being bent and it ended up sheering the wire inside. This one seems that it will prevent this from happening. Good sound quality too.
4,Strength Training,"This book meets the needs of individuals of a certain age. The authors give instructions on how to do the exercises and provide information on the benefits. Both gym equipment and free weight exercises are described. Moreover, the authors provide suggested programs including training for individual body parts such as chest, legs and arms but also programs for all around muscle toning. This is a useful and helpful manual for individuals interested in weight trainig. Moreover, it has the added benefit of motivating the user to find an appropriate program and stick with it."
5,a must-read,"The Book Thief is one of the most important books of this generation. Zusak's poetic, insightful storytelling draws the reader into the narrative and doesn't let him go until the end. Recommended to anyone age ten and up."
2,Doesn't measure up to the BBC version,"If you love the BBC version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, you'll be disappointed with this one."
4,proved me right... and wrong,"I bought this because I had a sneaky suspicion my oven wasn't working the way it should. Sure enough, it beeps to say it's preheated to 350, but it's really still at 250. And all this time I just thought my oven preheated super fast! So, that said, after waiting for a while, I see that my oven really is calibrated just fine (after a while, the temp rises to 350 and stays steady at that temperature). So, I just need to wait before I put stuff in the oven. I would never have known this without this nifty thermometer!My only problem is that I have yet to figure out a way to put the thermometer in there and keep it out of the way and yet still be able to read the face. I think I just need to keep playing with this to find something that works for me. I cook daily and often use both racks, so I am probably in a different place than most people."
2,"Feels dry, sits on top of skin and can rub off, bad texture","This lotion I was eager for due to its ingredients of Beta Glucan, which I take internally for immune support, and can also reduce scar tissue. Unfortunately, it is very thick, but not moisturizing. My skin feels tight and dry within minutes of using it. It gets worse overnight. If you use too much, it kind of beads up and rubs off. Does not sick or, does not feel emollient. It is not irritating, I do not get red or burn from it, so that is good. I use it as a body lotion, but at $28 for 2 ounces, it is not worth it. Your better off with Origins or something else."
5,John Bush Rules!!!!!!!!!,"Unlike this New York Wigger Clown who probably wears his Yankees hat sideways and says yo yo dawg. And was too much of a coward to leave his ID. The fact is without John Bush today it would be Anthrax who? With John in the band they rock harder and more melodic than they ever did. He should just stick to M&M and F-off. P.S. Armored Saint is 10,000 times the Heavy Metal Band that Anthrax will ever be!!! And if any more members of Armored Saint go over to help Anthrax out because there members keep dropping like flies then they should change the name to Anthrax Saint!!!"
2,Next?,"This book would have been more appropriately titled ""How to Talk to a Liberal (If the Dog Ate Your Homework and you Don't Want People to Know You Are Stupid."" It is just sad that somebody who claims to have everything figured out must rely so heavily on ""how-to"" books for having an informed discussion with whomever regarding politics."
1,Where money is more important than values.,"I've read and have been a subscriber for years. Vegetarian for most of my life.The magazine goes through editors like we go through soy milk. They just can't find their way it seems.These days, most recipes call for expensive and / or hard to find ingredients. Worse, some call for pre-made items that just can't be found. Case in point, the latest issue with the very yummy looking pizza on the cover? You will not find the recipe for the crust in the magazine. Funny, eh? Also, the magazine, for the most part, ignores the male reader.After all this time, I'm saying farewell to VT. With a host of wonderful blogs on the net, and amazing cooks who generously share there ""secrets"", I'll save the trees it takes to produce this advertising biased magazine.Update 7/3/12The magazine now sells ad space that highlight items that are NOT vegetarian. (Solgar No. 7, in the most recent issue.)"
2,"Good fighting that undermines the ""plot""","This is ultimately another Hollywood film whether or not the director intended it to be. It has little character development (if any) and doesn't really tell the story (beyond fighting which we already essentially knew). If you're looking for blood and guts alone, you're in for a ride. If you're looking for another Saving Private Ryan with character development and more than just fighting (with violence as a byproduct) then look elsewhere.This is a very one-sided film. Corrupted politics (also existent in the 'good sided' US) somehow translates into purely evil somalians that do nothing but kill (innocents and american soldiers alike).So, you will get to see the omnipotent americans kill those black hawk suckers alright (no pun intended...), but not much else. That's Hollywood for you."
2,Not a daily use pump,"After a month of use, I am already experiencing a reduction in suction. I have to take the pump off of my breast every other pump to retain suction. Also, milk easily leaks from the pump to bottle connection. I had been using the pump once a day to stock milk and maintain/increase production. When I contacted Medela with questions, they sent a canned reply: ""The Harmony is not a daily use pump. This pump is for moms who pump infrequently, such as the occasional night out. Also a great backup for electric pumps. Unfortunately, this pump is not proven to increase milk production."" It would be nice if that was mentioned in the product info here."
2,I'm sorry but...,"This is not a well written story. If you are a particular fan of this author and her style I'm sure you'll enjoy it. But for anyone else, the author seems undeveloped. Had I not seen the plug on the front cover that says she's a USA Today bestselling author I would have thought this was her first book. The main charcters are barely developed at all. The most revealing thing we know about them is that Serena, the heroine, is a supposedly beautiful 36 year old virgin. Yeah... The secondary characters are more fleshed out and likeable but still the book comes over as corny and slapstickish. If you need a really, really light read because your waiting to get a route canal at the dentists then sure, have fun reading. But for everyone else it's really not worth picking up."
4,My first bluetooth,"This is a nice product for the price. Works well. I broke the piece that connect to the ear (flimsy plastic and hard to put on/take off to charge) but fits fine in my ear without. For a first time user that doesn't use a bluetooth a lot, I would recommend it for the price. If you plan on using your bluetooth a lot, get one that fits the ear more securely."
4,smoother text,"There's 2 areas which could be improved. Upon starting the clear button needs to be activated to stop a scrolling message. Would be nice to be able to use it without this step. The other area is the large size text is great but the letters are somewhat block like. Smoothing of letters would be better. So far, the solver does its job well."
5,Buy it before it vanishes forever!,"Howard Waldrop's latest collection of ""alternate reality"" SF defies all convention. His ""what if the Nazis won WWII"" story brings Shemp Howard, Zero Mostel, Peter Lorre and Brecht's widow together in an absurdist play about a journey to Mars, the Red planet. Fats Waller and Tom Wolfe hang out on a dirigible. Three Mexican luchadors fight off ancient Aztec gods. That's just the beginning. Each story also has an afterword which also solves the riddle of the alternate reality and gives an insight into Waldrop's writing process. Waldrop's books never hang around the stores for long (he has about $6 in his bank account) and his stuff can be shelved under Science Fiction, Literature or anything else. I found my copy under Hunting/Fishing. Buy it on-line before it disappears!"
2,Time to Sleep...(I Blame Eminem),"I understand why so many people like Dido..She is beautiful, has a decent voice, comes across as a decent human being and is inoffensive...This album is the same - 'inoffensive'...some might say, bland...The tracks that work for me are 'Thank You' (used on Eminem's 'Stan'), but is done solo here and it works, 'Hunter' and 'Here With Me'...The rest just disappear into the background like a passing car...Nothing much happens, nothing inspires...I really want to like her, but it's all been done before..."
4,Best yet,"Takes forever to load, even on a fast machine. Good/Fast gaphics, but you must have a ""HOT"" video card and the more (and faster) RAM the better."
1,HORRIBLE,I loved these shoes for the first 2 weeks until i was walking to the store and two of the buttons fell off. Im so pissed that i spent so much money on these shoes and they are falling apart. I keep trying to return them and amazon wont let me. NEVER ORDER BEARPAW FROM AMAZON!
3,OK but not perfect for protection,"Gloves were delivered prompty. They are the gauntlet design I was looking for. However, they are different than the all-leather kind I had for a few years, and finally wore out. This pair has 2 kinds of leather, a rough leather on the cuff, and a kind of funny, shiny, smooth leather in the hand portion. This is the slightly darker part you see in the picture. The first time I used them, it was a cool, showery April day here in Seattle, and they got pretty wet. Then as I was cleaning up after a couple hours of use, I noticed a thistle that needed to be picked, just about a foot across, hugging the ground, and about ready to shoot a stalk up. So I reached down and grabbed it, and OUCH, one of the thorns stabbed right through into my index finger. I've been pretty careful with them since, which kind of defeats the reason for having a heavy-duty gauntlet glove."
1,Dull meets pointless,"If there's a point to this meandering, repetitive, and banal ""epic"" I certainly missed it. The author spends almost more time talking about what the main character eats than on what he feels or seeks. The moralism isn't even two dimensional and the characters in general fail to engage either the reader's interest or sympathy. The reveals come out of nowhere, as do the character's various triumphs; right after he gets done telling us how lost and hopeless he is, he goes out and decimates the fearsome enemy.I kept hoping it would get better, but this trudge never really picks up the pace."
2,Book of Visual Studio .NET,As a Visual Basic user from many years ago I bought this book to help me get to grips with the daunting IDE that Visual Studio presents. The danger for a new user is missing the fabulous new Wizards and other time saving things that are pre-built into VS but are sometimes tricky to find for the uninitiated.This book discusses .NET in detail but to be fair I knew about .NET's principles before. What I wanted was a guide to USING VISUAL STUDIO. And this is really not it. As an overall handy text for a newbie to .NET it is great but I don't think the title is right.
2,A Frightful Story,"A ghastly, horrifying story depicting the absolute chaos resulting from all but one person in a city going blind. As you can imagine, ALL systems broke down, people suffered terribly, deaths were frequent and gruesome. The love and caring of the one sighted person, the doctor's wife, was the only comforting thread in the story.The format and writing were just as difficult to stomach as the storyline - interminable sentences, and paragraphs, sparse and inadequate punctuation.Revolting as the scenes and events described were, I kept on reading as I had to know if there would be any reprieve for those poor souls."
2,Not what I expected,"I wanted to buy this movie very much because I love Jim Carrey. The man cracks me up. I'm glad that I didn't purchase this movie though, because it was not what I expected. I'm very glad that my nephew's friend let us borrow his. The only scenes that were funny was when Jim first got his powers and he started singing ""I got the power"" by the '90's group Snap. And when he made the other news reporter talk gibberish. I thought that was hilarious. Other than that, it was not all that fantastic. It did however, have a good moral to the story. So please people, do not go out and waste your money on this one. Borrow it from someone like I did, and judge for yourself."
2,Worked well...for a while,"Well, seems like this is a common problem with this device. Mine worked flawlessly for about 6 months of almost daily use, and then one day I plugged it in, it lit up blue as it always does, and then turned off...forever. The case smells like burned electronics, so I'm guessing some component inside just gave out. They need to use some higher-quality electronic components in this thing! I know it's relatively inexpensive, but I expected more than a few months of use out of it! In effect, my $20 basically went towards ""renting"" this unit for a few months. Quite disappointed."
4,neat picture book,The book is set in the 1930 and based on the historic story of Mokawk steelworks. The little boy in the story has a father who has gone to the city to work on the NewYork Sky scrapers. He misses his father and only get to see him on weekends. One day his Mama takes him into the city to visit his father. This are much different from the ways he is use to on the reservation. When he sees his father at work on the tall buildings he describes it as seeing his father dance across the sky. This is where the title of the book comes from.The book was easy to read and moved at a fast pace.I would recommend the book to others. It's a good book to read while learning more about New York City. It gives us a chance to think about how the city might have looked in the 1930's before all of the sky scrapers were built.
2,Not a very good quality,After seeing so many reviews I bought this for $25 but it is not worth for that money. You can get better quality for that money. So I don't recommnend unless it is less than $10.
1,Not a good game at all.,"After buying the ER game, I tried to get through my way around, but everytime I kept getting to one point it would freeze."
4,Beautiful,I haven't used it yet but it is really beautiful and has a nice weight -- not flimsy at all.
2,Great Concept - Poor Execution,"I ordered this bluetooth headset for my Blackberry 8700C.PROS: Great display; redial history and control buttons mean that you can use this headset to make and receive calls without checking the cell phone.CONS: Everything else. Poor connectivity; lots of static on the listening end; choppy reception; HEAVILY prone to wind noise; people on the receiving end stated that they could not hear me clearly, if at all.BOTTOM LINE: Great concept; poor execution. I would have LOVED to keep this headset for its features, but if it cannot properly function as a bluetooth headset, looks like I'm going to have to get a ""plain jane"" non-led display model.Gave the item 2 instead of 1 star due to the features. Perhaps this headset will work better with other phones."
1,Not like Grandma's,My grandmother had a nut chopper that looked just like this when I was a kid. She and I chopped many walnuts together over the years. This is not the nut chopper my grandmother had. The blades bent immediately and did not get the job done. It went right into the trash. Do NOT waste your money on this cheaply made piece of junk.
4,Sturdy but too loud to be used cabinet door cushion,"I was looking for bump pads to replace worn out ones for kitchen cabinet doors. My primary concern was the pads worn so thin (or fell out), that cabinet door closing sounded like someone slammed shut the door and was heard throughout the house.The reviews are strong so I bought one. They seem to be made out of rubber and felt sturdy but can give a little. Good depth also for cushioning between the door and the cabinet. After I applied, I closed the door normally and ""BAM""! It's just as loud as without any bump pads! ugh.These are great to replace worn out or missing bumps under small appliances. But if noise matters, it's not a good use for cabinet doors.I won't rate this badly since it is good product, just not a fit for my need."
5,Pacific series is awsome,"As a former marine I felt the series is produced in a way that gives a non marine a little insight into the corps and the bantering that goes back and forth. It is very graphic, but halfway through (part 5) shows them in Austrailia during some R&R - this may give guys who are watching with thier girl friend or wife some relief from all the action."
2,17 more minutes? Could have been 30 minutes less,"I cant remember why I got this film. I think I heard it was a funny movie and it got some good reviews so I got it. First off, comedy movies should never exceed the two hour mark. I really cant think of a comedy that lasted more then two hours, maybe some Amazon reader can help me out on that. I laughed only a few times during the whole film but it wasnt really long laughs. I heard the theater version is much better then this version which would make sense. The added 17 minutes puts it over two hours and most of the scenes could have been deleted. If this movie was about an hour and forty minutes, I probably would have enjoyed it more."
5,Harry's 2nd book is great!,"The sequel to ""Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone"" is just as transfixing and amazing as the first. Although it doesn't grab readers right in the beginning, after the first few chapters I was hooked. It had a great plot, characters, and end. Magical!"
2,didnt fit my face,Looked nice on the package but at the end it didnt completely fit my face and had some gaps in between. Therefore it did not work for dust protection. I sent it back to amazon. It may well work for you but I would recommend to try it in the store first.
3,Not his best,"This single was not Bo's best work. Inside Your Heaven doesn't really fit his style. However, Vehicle was fantastic. I'm sure his album will be better."
4,Elevator by Hot Hot Heat,"Hot Hot Heat is one of those bands that ooze coolness. Much like the Killers & The Strokes (clear inspirations), their blend of garage rock & pop hooks is infectious. Their talent is undeniable, and their latest picks up where Make up the Breakdown left off. However, this time around they have really stepped their game up. ""Goodnight, Goodnight"" would be comfortable alongside ""Bandages"" or ""No Not Now"". I was expecting the album to falter twards the end, but I was pleasently surprised to see that they were able to maintain the pace that ""Ladies & Gentleman"", ""You Owe Me an IOU"" & ""Running out of Time"" set at the beginning. The album title is a clear indication that this band is on the way up, and while they may get stopped at every other level as long as they stare clear of the ground floor I have no complaints."
1,Do NOT get this stuff on your fingers.,"I tried using this stuff on my joints, the liquid just gushes out & drips down your hand. It caused intense itching that lasts for an hour or more without an application of liquid antihistamine spray. Worse to come is when you have to go to the bathroom; Doesn't matter if your fingers are dry or if you've washed this stuff off with soap; your junk is going to come in contact with this stuff when you wipe, through skin or toilet paper, & it's going to burn like hellfire for awhile."
1,not Prokofiev,"I am surprised and depressed to see so many ecstatic reviews of this bizarre performance. Although the recorded sound is excellent and the orchestral performance largely quite fine, Maazel's tempi border on madness. Prokofiev does not use metronome markings, but Maazel pushes the slower, more contemplative movements into barroom marches, and drags some faster pieces into mush. Comparison with Ozawa and Rozhdestvensky, who knew and worked with SP, will quickly show how truly and sadly off the mark this recording is."
5,Light Entertainment,I was plesently surprised that I enjoyed this movie. I loved GET SHORTY and I really wanted to see BE COOL but the bad reviews kept me away at first. But it was a boring saturday afternoon and we decided to hit the movies and this is what we picked. I found BE COOL charming and funny. Is not laugh out loud funny but witty and lightweight. This is a great film to watch just to pass the time. Overall BE COOL is relaxing entertainment and if I may... cool.Plus Uma and John are wonderful in a lovely reunion to PULP FICTION.
4,Worthy Follow Up To Knee Deep in the Hoopla,"As far as musical integrity and importance..STARSHIP doesnt come to mind. As far as light airy 80's rock songs, STARSHIP comes in for a dead center landing right into my brain. Knee Deep In The Hoopla( 1985) had 3-4 catchy songs and so does ""No Protection"" (1987). I liked the opening track ""The Beat Patrol"". Then there's the song from Mannequin ""Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now."" That song could have been marketed as part of a ""BAND-AID"" project for stopping world hunger at the time.""Set the Night To Music"" is Spot-on for another solid hit. ""Let the Children Follow"" is catchy. In a nutshell, Starship followed suit from their previous album. Maybe it doesnt have quite the ultimate cheeziness of ""Sara"" and ""We Built This City"" but there's plenty of cheese whiz for you to enjoy. I know I do."
1,Terrible book - don't waste your time & money,"I don't know what people who would review this book well are thinking. These authors may be good at creating the UML, but terrible at explaining it. The sentences are packed with words they haven't explained - or uncommon uses of words that really have no meaning, unless you are already a UML expert. I can't imagine a more poorly written text."
5,Awesome!,"As a Systems Administrator, this is (by far) the best scripting resource I've found.This is a MUST HAVE!Most IT books have a lot of ""filler"". Not this one! Every page is filled with excellent information and valuable pre-written scripts that you can start using immediately.Excellent Value!This book has more bang for the buck than I've seen in years!If you're considering purchasing this book, don't waste any more time. Buy it today while you can still get your hands on a copy! (out of print)"
5,nostalgic novelty toy,"This is fun for the whole family and for anyone who comes by and wants to give it a try. The quality is good, except for the little felt stickies in the holes which are coming up at the edges (easily fixable). I don't remember what sort of box it came in, but I'm guessing not that great of one because we didn't keep it. A nice box would help with the storage aspect; as it is, it has just been sitting out here and there--a little conversation piece."
2,Save the money,"I have no complaints about the translation to DVD, but this movie had so much potential that it just blew. It's the first movie that I've ever seen where for the first half, I was blown away and completely drawn in, but by the end, I wanted my money back. They blew that bad. It had some many things that it could have dealt with, but instead, it relied on a ridiculous plot twist that ruined the film. Save your dough."
2,good but buy extended warrantee!,"It's a great phone. It has more bells and whisles than a mortal can use, including an anwering machine in every handset. I have three handsets to go with the base unit, which covers my two-story house nicely. A little over a year since I bought them, one of the hand units began to go beep erratically with the function window flashing and running around the features. The battery was on ""1"" but was not accepting the charge. I switched batteries. The unit did the same crazy song and dance, as if someone was rotating the joystick button. This joystick button seems to be ""stuck"" electronically. Must be the circuit board. There is nothing by way of support on the Panasonic website. So I am about to replace the unit on Amazon. In twnety years of woning panasonic phones, this is the first time, I've had failure. Stuff happens, as Rumsfeld used to say."
4,notes on nursing,Notes on nursing transcends time. Information contained is still very much relevant today. The perioperative nurse especially will benefit from principles.
3,"Good book, needed a little more","If you are trying to figure out how to generically structure your communications with others I think this book does a good job. I think it is especially useful for presentations.Essentially, the book advocates 1. catching the readers attention, telling them what you're going to tell them, tell it to them, and then tell them what you told them - which is a good structure. The book also is quite succinct on how to execute on this structure. The problem I have is that this book doesn't deal with how to develop the content that will be integrated into this structure. I did expect the book to talk about how to select the points to discuss, how to structure each of those point for maximum effectiveness, etc. since I believe they are pretty important to speak clearly and concisely.Overall this is a book that will help you get your point across...whether it will help the clarity and conciseness is another issue."
1,This movie was terrible!,"This movie was terrible! My boyfriend and I watched it in the theater, and we both walked about feeling we wasted our money! There were a couple funny parts, but the acting, language, and storyline of the movie--ALL TERRIBLE! Would not recommend this movie to anyone!"
4,A whole book about one state-wide election?,"Yes, and it was almost as compelling as Vol. 1, Path to Power, which was breathtaking in its coverage of LBJ's Texas Hill Country and his first 35 years. I read Vol 1 in 1992 and could not put it down. Breathless when I got to the last page, I thought it better to read something else for a while. (Go figure.) It took eight years to get back to Vol 2. The tale of the 1948 election is dark and depressing--are U.S. elections still so corrupt?--and leaves one wondering from where does LBJ pull the intelligence and charm he needed to accomplish what he did during his presidency. I trust Robert Caro will have strong opinions on that in his next volume."
1,"Gee, ANOTHER teeny bopper","I bought this cd because I enjoyed the uplifting song ""I'm Diggin'It"". When I listened to the whole cd, I noticed all the songs sounded the same. People, this is just another version of Britney Spears, country style. If you want good country, buy Reba or Faith Hill. I am very disappointed."
1,Out of Business,"MoneyDance seems to have gone by the wayside. No support, no website, nothing. So waste of damn money. Don't get it- if you're looking for support."
5,"Sometimes, it's better to bite the bullet and pay the cost.","Yes, I know you can find ways (listed on the Internet) of making this tool using plumbing bushings. I'm all for innovation, but I just did not have that ""warm fuzzy feeling"" about using a jury rigged tool at 170 ft. lbs. The Jury rigged tool was going to cost about half of what this tool costs. For me, it was worth the extra cost to feel comfortable fighting the unbelievable torque loads. I also needed, 2 very long breaker bars, a 3.5 ft long cheater bar (I almost had to use my 6 ft long cheater bar!), an extra deep 19mm impact (yes impact!) socket for my application (05' Honda 1.7L). The tool is very durable. You will never have to replace this tool, unless you loan it out or lose it. BTW you may be wondering what you can use to make a cheeter bar. I found that a cut down TV antenna masts works."
2,mediocre,"The callow lives of a complacent couple get shaken up when the house next door goes bad. As haunted house stories go, this is not particularly scary and compares unfavorably with ""The Haunting of Hill House"" and ""The Shining."" The book's most notable feature is its portrayal of a bland suburban couple who manage to be offensive and banal at the same time. Are there really people like this? At the end, I wondered if Siddons deliberately created two unlikable people to create a sense of ambivalence in the reader about the effect of the house on their little sheltered lives.By the last page, I was simultaneously rooting for the House Next Door and for the book to end."
2,"Cute shapes, difficult to remove ice","Shapes are a neat idea, but removing the ice from the trays can be challenging. The soft rubber seems to hold onto the ice."
5,Best book!!!,"This I would have to say is the best book on OOBE. Some of the ideas Mr. Robert Bruce presents, I don't agree with but still it is an excellent book. His split consciousness idea in the begining chapters is hard to understand but maybe that is the way things happen in OOBE. The exact mechanics are interesting but I am more interested in the results. He does have outstanding pictures which clarify the techniques to induce OOBE. He also talks about his OOBE involving prophecies and gives his personal example as well as how to record OOBE and dreams. For a novice I would recommend it but would tell them to focus more on the OOBE techniques presented rather than try to understand the mechanics of OOBE which I found complicated. However, this is an excellent, outstanding book! I would highly recommend it to all."
1,TERRIBLE PRODUCT,I also bought this product because of the association with the Monster Cable name. I thought my stereo had gone out with the first listening. I didn't imagine that the adapter could cause that bad of a sound quality. I had a cheap one that fell apart after several years of use that was far superior. DONT BUY THIS THING
4,A Great Book about the Turning Point Against Japan,"For a guy who has been dead a while, the author keeps turning out some good books. At Dawn We Slept and Miracle at Midway are two of them. Midway was the battle that turned the tide against Japan. Midway is a Battle so exciting that fiction could never top it, and yet this was history. And this book captures the battle brilliantly. Walter Lord also did a great job in Incredible Victory. This battle showed the determination of American sailors and airman, the leadership of Nimitz, the importance of aircraft carriers,some luck and intelliegence. I enjoyed this book very much."
2,"Informative, but wordy","Reading this book was much like reading a college textbook. The information therein was helpful, but the style was wordy and technical. The book could have been more concise. As a reference guide, I preferred the book House Buying for Dummies."
2,Decent beginning with worst ending i've ever read,"I am not sure if most of the reviews here are from the authors friends but this book wasn't very good. Maybe there is some meaning or some existential stuff at the end but the end was just plain confusing. I don't want to spoil it if you do want to read it based on other reviews but when I read the conclusion I was thinking ""What the !@@#$"". What sucks is it builds up a big mystery and then goes off on the most incredible useless tangent I can think of. Maybe I just don't understand it but if you are looking for something to read that doesn't require a degree in philosophy then I don't recommend this book."
4,Treasure those hands,"I received the first set as a baby shower gift for my boy - some 5 years ago now. Bought a second one for my second son - one year left to do. Grandma jumped right in and bought this for my daughter who is turning one soon. The process is simple enough. I did find at first it took several tries to get the consistency correct, but was easy enough to fix. The biggest challenge came with getting the toddlers to coorperate... found those couple of years, with some help, naptime was a good time to make the handprints. My boys would sleep right through the ""procedure""..."
1,Waste of money!,"This is a terrible product!First it came broken. When they ship the new one it never worked properly, and we're talking about a skillet here! Everything gets glued on it no matter how hard you try to ""cure"" the skillet. It's on the garbage now."
1,Horrible,"Usually even with a bad script, you can't go wrong with a high calibre cast. Taye Diggs, Benicio, James Caan, Juliette Lewis... all some of my top actors. But even so, McQuarrie manages to mess this one up. I blame the direction moreso than the storyline. I think the storyline could have been fixed with better direction. As presented, the story was very hard to follow not only in terms of cohesiveness but also in being able to keep my interest. I only watched it to the end out of sheer curiosity. I can't recall in recent memory seeing a movie with such potential fall on its face. Oh wait, there's Kill Bill 2 which actually is better than this one. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. Instead do what I did and watch ""Eight Heads in a Duffel Bag"" which also was better than this one!"
1,Do not buy this bike,Do not buy it if you are not slim and short (I'm 5'10'' and 260 lb). That's bad example of a budget item. Saddle was broken at the third day. Pedal was broken at the fifth day. The Saddle tube is too short for an adult and I had to replace it. Front wheel is not straight. Brakes and shift are ugly.Now I know that it's beter spend $150 more and get really nice bike. Please don't repeat my mistake.
4,Rise against is and will always be awesome!,"Great CD! If your a rise against fan u definetly need this album in your collection. If ur missing it, get it NOW!! This cd shows where RA come from."
5,Great Show ! Cool Story ! Hyperfast Action! Insane Comedy!,Oh yeah! I've been waiting for this show to come to DVD and it is here! Oh yeah!I like Samurai Jack & also watching Shaw Brothers martial arts movies...this is a perfect blend of both!Get it!
1,nice sheets - unfortunately they were torn,"I excitedly opened the package only to find that the fitted sheet of my new 300 thread sheets was torn. It was like a knife cut right through the middle of the sheets. The sheets were so soft and smooth, with very deep pockets on the fitted sheet and generous overhang on the flat sheet, but I never got to sleep on them. However, I called the folks at Amazon customer service and they are sending me a return label and will give me a full refund. Unfortunately, they no longer have this set available. :("
2,too heavy,This flatware set is very heavy and the spoons are very shallow. My three year old doesn't like them. Waste of money. My daughter prefers her Oneida flatware set.
2,Does Not Work Too Well,"After reading all the previous positive reviews, it influenced me to purchase the Closys Oral Rinse. Unfortunately, the product does not live up its hype. In fact, I am disappointed that the product does not last very long, maybe 1 hour max of fresh breathe. (I did not even eat or drink anything after I rinsed with Closys). There were no detailed instructions on flossing, using a tongue scraper, or any additional preventive routine. I can't believe other reviewers rate the product so high??? Luckily, I found a much better product called ProFresh. The company gives a detailed preventive routine which only takes a few minutes to do. Even morning bad breath completely disappeared. However, there is a sight Clorox taste. To my amazement, I now have fresh breath all day."
1,Don't Fit,The pair I received didn't have concentric circles when squeezed. One barely made it onto my Olympic bar with excessive force. The other wouldn't go no matter how hard I tried. Buyer beware.
4,Nighthawk Detector,The product was delivered as promised with no issues of any kind. The item is a plug n play unit with battery backup an provides the security that is needed when using gas heat. Great product coming from a great company
3,"A book of Tips, Tricks and Anecdotal Evidence","Let me start out by stating that I enjoyed this book. There are tons of great quotes peppered throughout the text. The reason for the 3 star rating is the lack of data to back up any claims. Every bit of advice is backed by a speech or presentation that demonstrates the effect the author is recommending. There isn't much explanation as to why the advice works. Just a bunch of ""Do this. Do that. See... it worked for Lincoln and Churchill"".To summarize: Not enough reasoning to explain WHY the advice works."
5,Great CD,"Great audio although I wish some of the earlier recording were stereo, but still the best sounding CD I've heard by this group."
5,Miss Julia Meets Her Match,"I have fallen in love with the characters in the ""Miss Julia"" series. Ann B. Ross always thinks of a fresh new story line, so each book is a gem."
2,Winding Does not Last for Long,"This is a nice looking watch, with a real ""man"" feel, but unless you will be wearing it every day for the whole day (for self-winding), you will need to set the time again every time you wear it, since the ""wind life"" does not last long. I still like the watch, but am surprised it has such high reviews with this issue."
5,My 1 year old loves this!,"This seat was so easy to put on and well worth the money! My husband and I had difficulty deciding between this seat and a trailer. We went with this because of all of the good reviews, and I am so glad that we did. My 1 year old loves this seat and has since the first time he got into it. I put this seat on myself in a matter of minutes. It was too easy. This is a great product!"
4,"Very sturdy, minor inconveniences.","I am new to videography. I just bought a Canon Vixia HG10 (High Def camcorder) and wanted a tripod solid enough to hold up the camera without any issues. For that concern, this tripod is excellent. It does its job fantastically and is very easy to extend, lock, and unlock with the tab mechanism built into the legs.I do have one complaint. I set it up in my dorm to record me playing Rock Band (for split screen videos with the drum chart) and due to limited space my positioning is very restrained. It would make it much easier to be able to angle the tripod camcorder mounting plate down, but it locks flat at 90 degrees, level with the ground. This is my only complaint, it tilts up and to the sides very smoothly and as long as you tighten with pressure, the threads hold and do not unthread themselves.Overall I would recommend it, but if you know you want to angle any downward-looking shots, do a little bit more research before deciding."
4,"Good camera, some minor quirks","I got this as a gift over a year ago. Works great and I'm very happy with it. However, on a few occasions, the lens failed to open and I had to wait a while for it to start working again. As with some digital cameras, the most annoying feature is the slight delay in taking pictures. This is very frustrating when you're trying to capture a baby's actions! The mini movie feature is great and so is the quality of the photos. This is a good camera overall."
5,Just as good as the first,"The second stage is just as good as the first, only it is half the length. They also include the Extra Stage movie Battle 14 which is about the Sil-Eighty and its two drivers which is about the length of two episodes. In the extras on the Battle 14 disc they include the uncut movie. The Third stage is a full length movie and does seem to com to somewhat of a stopping place for the series, but don't worry! They made a stage four and it doesn't feel like they just tacked it on."
1,NO WAY,This movie was a waste of time money and really stupid. The plot was horrible the special eefects looked out of a cartoon and was really dumb
2,Milked!!!,"Midnight Club was terrible,2 was good and 3 is being milked.How is it fun to street race in a game, no fun to me.Rockstar should stick making fun violent games that push the elevlope instead of putting effort into making a dumb, been there racing game, it should aleast be sold for 10 dollars instead of 50 because the really good games deserve to be sold at 50."
1,"The number of errors makes it nearly useless at best, confusing at worst.","It's true. It is full of mistakes. I quit after the first chapter in frustration over the errors. McGraw Hill does not offer an errata for the book. Shame on you McGraw Hill. Either quit selling it, or give us a comprehensive errata so we may fix our already purchased copies. I will be very slow to trust all future books by this publishing company."
1,Pigs in Heaven,Book was sold as new but was obviously used with markings on the back cover showing a price of $5.00. I paid more than that. This is not an honest company.
5,Awesome album,"I grew up listening to Fred with Commissioned and his first two solo projects. They were very soulful and urban. I was kind of disappointed when he left commissioned and formed a choir because I knew that would be the end of the urban Fred I'd come to love. So this album takes me back to the Fred I use to love. You've still got those choir, praise songs in there. But it's nice to hear fred do his own bgvs again.So if you love commissioned, and Fred's first two solo projects, then this is the album to get. Though this one has mainly a Neo-Soul feel to it. He even has the Neo-Soul artist, Musiq on two tracks. But all in all, very good album."
1,USELESS,"SINCE I WAS EIGHT WEEKS ALONG, MY OB HAS ALWAYS COMMENTED ON HOW LOUD AND STRONG MY LITTLE ONE'S HEARTBEAT IS. HERE I AM, AT 24 FULL WEEKS, AND STILL CAN'T HEAR A THING EXCEPT STATIC AND GURGLING. NOT FOR A LACK OF TRYING EITHER, I'VE SAT AND LAID IN DIFFERENT POSITIONS, TRIED 200 DIFFERENT LOCATIONS, AND EVEN TRIED A BRAND NEW BATTERY...NOTHING HAS WORKED. I WISH I HAD JUST PUT THAT MONEY TOWARDS A GOOD PEDICURE!"
3,not my cup of tea but a good movie,this movie was a good movie I thought it was funny the USSR was our enemy in 2010 but this movie was made in 1980 I hope everyone is just as scared as the return of the USSR as me lol this movie made sence where 2001 made no sence you can skip 2001 and enjoy this movie if anything seeing how much 2001 sucked made me like this movie even more I just can't give it more then 3 stars
2,A rather boring translation of the great Dreigroschenoper,"One has to know and understand the original German text of the Dreigroschenoper to be really able to judge the quality of the English translations. This one, used among others by Helen Schneider on her album with Weill songs, has nothing of the sarcasms of the German lyrics. Better read the 1954 translation of Marc Blitzstein or the translation made by Frank McGuinness in the early 1990s."
4,This Can Be A Real Experience For SOME People,"General Leland Zevo takes over Zevo Toys and wants to secretly make weapons disguised as toys for the good of military, but that is not what Leslie Zevo wants. He only wants to carry on with his father's business who left it to Leland instead of Leslie and the general seems like he is mentally ill after a while in being convinced that he makes weapons and not toys and Leslie soon doesn't like it anymore, so the only thing left he has to do is to have his sister, his girlfriend and the general's son Patrick join him and go against the general and try to undo everything he has done with the factory. This has to be one of my favorite films. It either people love it or hate it according to every other review on this movie."
5,What a Power Punch,"This movie packs a punch. From the opening you are grabbed by the colors and then the action which never lets up. Mickey Roarke, Bruce Willis, and Clive Owens turns in stunning performances. I love the old cars, and how you never show exactly how they made the grapics. Rosario Dawson in black leather looks truly a marvelous creature to feast your eyes on. The Blonde chicks who plays the silent killer is awesome. The preformance by Michael Clark Duncan, Jessica Alba, Brittney Murphy, and Bernicio Del Torro are good, but are quickly forgotten. I've seen this three times and do plan to buy it. ""Yes"" it is pretty gory, is aimed at adults, ""Yes"", it does have hyper violent moments, and ""Yes"" even the good guys with questionable morals become good guys, but none of this detracts from it."
5,Hope it does what it's supposed to,"I purchased this filter for one reason which is to protect my lens. Difficult as it is to rate the filter simply based on that factor, I'd say it appears that it'll help keep my lens clean, scratch-free, and hopefully protect it if a mishap occurs! As everyone is saying, better to break the filter than your costly lenses.As for the effects it has on photo quality, I've read some other reviews that it affects photos in low light/night shots. I'm just a beginner so maybe it'll be helpful to look into that via other reviews."
3,"Old Root Canals, the Good, the Bad and the Ugly!","Root Canal Cover UpThis book describes in detail what can happen to older root canals, i.e. infections, degrading of the material left in the space where the root used to be... It's very thorough.If you need something else to worry about in your life, and you have root canals older than a couple of years, this is the book for you.I read it, discussed it with my dentist, and filed it on my library shelf.It is not a book I would recommend to anyone unless the person is dealing with a root canal problem."
2,Not your father's Metallica or your big brothers....,"This is a different kind of Metallica.There isn't a whole lot going on with this album. Doesn't sound like anything they've done before.I'm sad to say that the best songs are mediocre at best (Purify & Frantic).Maybe Metallica is hoping for a new fan base on this one, because it ain't my Metallica. At least Load & Re-Load sorta sounded like Metallica.Jason Newsted is probably cracking open a beer and lightin' one up and laughing his [*] off being relieved with the knowledge that he made the right decision.Recommend not buying it. I'm gonna see what I can do about returning my copy, just too painful."
3,Marginally Good!,"This is a good CD if you are new to smooth jazz.It really doesn't measure up to ""real"" smooth jazz works but it gets an A for effort."
5,So good but I hate it ended,"The series is so good it makes me want to tweet/facebook Todd and beg him to finish the series on dvd. Some episodes did upset me because Spawn just pouted and acted like an emo kid and i amazed that spawn was allowed to sulk/be emo for so long when the devil/clown did nothing about it but it is a terrific series. I paid $10 for it and got it in 2 days, watching season 2/3 as of this review. I am sad I know I am reaching the few remaining episodes."
2,yet another remake,"I don't question Hollywood for taking a beloved cheesy children's show and turning it into a modern remake. Remakes are all the rage these days. Unfortunately this one is way too serious for it's own good. Will I really find the answers to life's great mysteries in a serious version of a cheesy kid's show? LOL!It's all far more bleak and serious than the original, but that doesn't make it profound. Some kind of fun remake on the old show might have been entertaining. This serious take on it is often just dull. What does it mean to be alive? It means that life is too short for heavy handed nonsense like this!"
2,Lost and gone emo,"Musically speaking, ""Keep it together"" could be mistaken for a different band. Guster's had an evolving sound throughout all their records, but this is less evolution and more mutation.This album would fit in well on any contemporary radio station, amidst emo, ""punk,"" and other pop-friendly genres. While Guster have always been catchy and never been too ""experimental,"" This jumps into the pool with the other sickeningly sweet pop music.Perhaps it's what they wanted, but I'm vastly disappointed in this record, longtime fan or not."
1,"Horrid, Simply Horrid","David Gilmour has made a living off of singing songs written by Roger Waters and pretending that he had a hand in the song. Now, to leverage off of the death of Roger's former bandmate, Syd Barrett, Gilmour actually has the nerve to sing and release a cover of Arnold Layne.When this song was written, recorded, and released by Pink Floyd, Gilmour wasnt even in the band. But that wont stop Gilmour from tring to make a buck or two off of someone else's talent...he has done it for 30 years off of Roger Water's talent.However, I suppose it beats singing songs written by his hilariously embarrassing untalented wife, Polly Samson, which he has done in his last two terrible efforts (Division Bell and On An Island).Some people simply have no shame."
5,more fun than watching a yuppie's tie in a fan belt,"After years of trying to hide my youthful attachement to bad horror movies, hot rods, and tiki madness I was able to come out of the closet after seeing Cult of the Psychic Fetus at the Bank in NYC.Truely one of the great monuments of American culture."
2,Stabila Plate Level Case,"I do not know how to rate this product. When it was delivered Fed Ex thru it over the fence and my dog chewed it. Since then, i have been trying to replace it thru Amazon to no satisfaction. Amazon has no phone number to talk to a real person, just a very complicated website with no contact for this type of problem. The vendor who sent this item has not responded to numerous E-mails. However Amazon. com has acknowledged they were sent. Since then I have re-ordered the product direct and hope Amazon reimburses me"
5,Love the movie,This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I really enjoyed the price that I paid for the movie also.
2,Glimmer of Hope,"Vapor Trails holds a glimmer of hope for fans of Rush, however, while it tries to rock a bit harder than recent albums, it lacks overall musical inspiration and melodic structure. Vocal lines are largely directionless and void of emotion, and even some of the guitar riffs are reused on this album from A.L.'s Victor project as well as previous Rush albums. Nothing really new to grab onto from this album except for a few cool production tricks. I am very happy to see the band back together again after such a long break, but I really don't feel rewarded for waiting so long."
3,Motorola HS 820 Bluetooth,"The unit works well and is very light weight. The only drawback is the charger. Most bluetooth use either mini or micro usb, this has its own unique charger so none of my other chargers will work with it."
2,Silly!,"Judging by the other reviews in this site, it seems I am the only one who didn't like this book. I think it is the most insubstantial and fluffiest romance I have ever read. There was no real story line and throughout the book, the lead characters either kept scowling, grinning, shouting or being plain angry.The language was so stilted that it took me 3 days to finish this one!There was no character development and I found everyone in this book getting on my nerves."
1,Not operational,The unit will power on but will not play tapes. I tried several 8mm pre-recorded tapes and the unit will not play them.
5,Best of the trilogy.,"I reckon this is the best of the trilogy. Decent plot, good acting (Rosamund Kwan a very cute actress too). And you can hardly find a fighting scene as well choreographed as the one between Jet Li and Donnie Yen, both being ""real"" masters from Shaolin. When it comes to Kung-fu in the post-Bruce-Lee era, only the well-trained techniques of Li and Yen can really take your breath away (unless you prefer Jackie Chan's acrobatic moves and funny stuff, that is). Jet Li goes on scoring big with ""Kiss of the Dragon"", but I don't think he is cut out for the double role in ""The One"". So far my top five martial arts films are: ""Fist of Fury"" (Bruce Lee), ""Iron Monkey"" (Donnie Yen), ""Wing Chun"" (Michelle Yeoh), ""Once Upon a Time in China"" and ""New Legend of Shaolin"" (Jet Li)."
1,What the...?,"Who would have guessed that such an expertly rendered series would degenerate into harlequin romance so suddenly and compeletely? To be fair, I was enthralled for the first 98% of this novel. It was the last 2% that I found so utterly disappointing. My advice to a prospective reader is to buy the cheapest paperback copy of this book that you can find and rip out the last chapter. If I had omitted the final chapter from my reading, I would have given Hannibal a 4-star rating instead of 1."
1,Lighter than specificed,"The web site describes this item as follows: Product Dimensions: 16x12x13.5 inches; 4.8 pounds. This weight compared favorably with a decent 20 qt. pot I already have, so I ordered it.It seemed flimsy when I took it out of the box, so I weighed it: 3.6 lb.I'm returning it."
3,Night driving glasses,Bought these in hopes it would help with night time driving. It did not help. I still see halos. I think it would work better if you were behind a computer screen all day.
5,Enjoyed it,Its nice to watch the older shows good family show I will tell others about it funny good laughs thanks
3,The American James Bond,"Where James Bond needs all these gadgets to perform superhuman acts Flint usese ingenuity, and some neat gadgets. He's trying to stop Malcom Rodney a suave spy played tongue-in -cheek by the handsome Edward Mulhare. The movie is a little slow and somewhat cheesy but it is defintely the father of Austin Powers, if you like that 60's spy stuff. The confrontation between Flint and Rodney is a highlight along with the three mad scientists(in cluding the chinese scientist with the Jewish last name and the caucasin scientist with the chinese name)"
1,"If I could go lower than one star, I would!","First I'll say, in defense of this novel, I am a Prince George's County resident, so my opinion maybe a little bias. With that said....this novel was awful. The characters were one-dimensional and very predictable; the storyline weak and predictable and the writing...well you get the point. The references to our area were sterotypical (and grossly inaccurate)...Really Connie, you didn't have to move to Prince George's County to write this story. Sorry, there is no save here as far as I'm concern, all around bad novel."
4,jol,I have loved Babe Ruth since the 70's and Wells Fargo is a timeless piece of music that sounds as good today as it did 32 years ago!
5,Remarkably Easy Listen,"This record is an entirely original breath of fresh air. It makes you feel good about life, and is highly inspirational. Listen for yourself; it's a great work."
3,Above average...barely,"I'm sorry, but I've been a fan of this band since their self-titled album and I'm very disappointed in their CD ""Home"". The band seems to be going for a ""let's see how low our guitars can go"" aproach. Lajon doesn't scream nearly as much as he did on the first album. Listen to their debut then listen to Home, the new album just isn't nearly as heavy (vocals,guitars, everything). Lately I've been seeing alot of them on MTV, I'm wondering...perhaps they toned down just a bit to be apart of the Korn/Limp Bizkit MTV crowd? All this aside, Home is still worth picking up. Just don't expect the same Sevendust sound you heard in the debut. Be sure to check out ""Denial"" and ""Reconnect""."
4,"Not as gory, but still suspenseful","""The Alienist"" was much harder to put down, and ""Angel of Darkness"" still retains that quality. Mr. Carr definitely has a flair for being able to transport one to the past and he pulls no punches with this novel. His glorious descriptions of wondrous locations and characterizations of famous people like Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Diamond Jim make you feel as if you are there. The book isn't as gory as the last, but it'll make you sweat nonetheless. All our favorite characters return (Stevie Taggert, Cyrus, Mr. Moore, Sarah, The Doctor and the Issacsons) plus new interesting characters. The bit with Kat is a little drawn out and it'd be great if we could delve deeper into Libby Hatch's psyche, but we get the satisfaction of learning more about Stevie and the Doctor. ""Angel of Darkness"" is dark, funny, and suspenseful. A perfect combo for a great book."
5,An intersting testimony.,Another try with the rewiev since it obviously hasn't been registered the first time wich was may the first. Very good dvd quality and very rewarding watching.
3,Vacume only lasted a year,"This was a great Vacume....for about a year. I live on a dirt road so there is alot of dust in the house. The cup filter had to be cleaned weekly or I would lose suction. And after about 3 months I never did have the suction it first had. The side Hepa filter is hard to find, I never did find a replacement for it, I just blew it out with the air compressor. It's been about a year and the motor just siezed on me. I am guessing it is because the side hepa filter got clogged. The side filter always looks clean, but blow it out and you will be amazed at how much fine dust is stuck in it. I am in search of a new vacume, and I don't think I will get another one of these."
3,Good but dated and too idealistic,"A romance should be sweet and neat, but not unbeliveable and outdated. These stories are wonderful romances for young girls, but lack enough steam and substance for anyone over the age of 21."
2,downhill since the last book,I bought and loved Jenkins' A Walk Across America. I couldn't get enough so I bought this book. This book reads very bland. There is not much excitement and not much insight. I couldn't finish it was so boring.
1,Never received it.,"I ordered this subscription 3 months ago, I won't need it soon and I have no idea if it will ever show up..."
1,"I wanted buy the book but you sent me a dvd, I will nebver buy something from you again","I wanted buy the book but you sent me a dvd, I will never buy something from you again heinrich geisser. Thde book would interest me very much"
5,Excellent general beginners resource,"I agree with one of the other reviewers--buy this book before you buy any fish. Provides all of the basics of water changes, chemistry, fish selection and aquarium setup. Very complete in that respect. Simply and directly written. Lacks some of the in-depth detail on diseases, plants, fish species and the like, but generally with explanations as to why.Best of all, it works. I have had aquariums on and off all my life. Following the advice of this book, I have lost very few fish, have a cleaner and much more successful tank, and generally happier fish. I don't know a higher praise I can offer."
5,Love it!,"I have had my large board (slate color) for about 2 years, and I use it all the time. I put it in the dishwasher routinely. It does have some cut marks on it and appears slightly ""faded"", but I have had no chips, and no warping. It still looks beautiful in my kitchen. I love how light and easy to handle it is. I do agree that it sometimes will slide, especially if I am kneading dough on it - but the new ones now come with gripper corners so that should resolve that issue. I have an expensive maple board, but I never use it since I bought the Epicurean."
4,No Hippo!,"Okay products, but ordered specifically because I wanted to replace the blue hippo my little one LOVES, that was in the first one purchased. NO Hippo! :( Don't even need the products."
1,Some helpful pregnancy advice but too alternative,"Unfortunately the politics of this book are a turn off, the author has little regard for the conventional family model of two biological parents being bonded to child"
3,humming bird feeder,I like very much the appearance of this feeder and it is attracting hummers but I have trouble with air in the feeding tube even though I completely fill the feeder . How do I solve this problem ?
1,"Cuisinart Much Better Quality, Watch out for ""Exploding"" cup","I also had the cups explode/separate. Very messy cleanup on the counters. Poor quality. I had the Cuisinart 2 to go for about 3 years and my mom decided to suprise me with a ""new"" one for Christmas. Well, after giving away my still perfectly working Cuisinart, I have had several complaints including spilled coffee while driving from the loose and poor quality cups as well as the ""explosions"" written about by another reviewer. There is nothing worse than putting on your coffee, getting in the shower and then come down to leave for work and find a big messy puddle all over the kitchen counter. And then you have no time to make another cup because you will be late! That makes for a terrible morning and a terrible coffee maker."
2,Boring...hardly any action...and a big no in the fun department,"I bought this DVD because Amy Jo Johnsen is in it. (One of my favorite actresses.) What I expected was a decent vampire movie, with some blood and guts, and a good storyline. What I got was a movie with TALKING, TALKING and more talking, and a boring storyline. I saw hardly any action, hardly any fun, and hardly anything interesting. I was extremely disappointed in Amy for starring in such a boring, unintriguing movie. The only actual action was toward the end with the final battle between Seth and Viki's ex. It was about an hour and fifteen minutes of explanations, and useless talking.If you are looking for a movie with some action and fun, look elsewhere.As much as I hate to put an Amy Jo movie down, I am doing so."
5,Thorough but understandable,This is an excellent Systematic Theology written in a manner the non-scholar can benefit and enjoy. This is much needed today to make systematic theology approachable and understandable to all.
3,Not exactly what you see,"In the picture this looks nice and sleek flat grinder. It is triangler shaped,3 dimentional and larger than it appears, but it actually works well."
2,Leaks,"It's leaking from the bottom after changing filters for the third time. On top of that, I see particulate floating in the water. I have one more filter and once that's used it's back to Pur."
1,Kelly should take her own advice.,Please...Do what your album title says. It would make the world a better place.
5,Photography Book Review,"The book realy helps you to see things different, also the book was is great condition (Used) when it arrived."
5,Good Night and Good Luck,Excellent history and documentary type movie. Represents the events of the 50's in the US. I highly recommend this DVD to any history buff.
1,waisted $,"We could not get it to work. we had bought a new router, linksys, so bought an adapter to go with it for the bedroom. Would not work, so we used the old adapter and it was easily installed. it was the same adapter company, but the new style would not download with the cd"
2,Not kidding: Different colors sound different!,"I wouldn't have believed it, but I just ordered three different colors, and the difference in sound quality is incredible. The ""rouge"" sound amazing, but the ""rocker red"" and ""jungle green"" sound terrible with absolutely no bass. I am aware that fit matters a lot, and they all fit the same. But they don't sound the same at all. I guess I'm happy that I bought 5 pairs of Rouge and only 1 of the other two! By they way, I know they are authentic because I bought them all directly from v-moda."
2,Jeff Dunham disappointed,"We have several of Jeff Dunham's tapes and they are hilarious. This one was more blue (more foul language) than before, and far too many racist overtones for your liking. It simply wasn't very funny. Wish I had saved my money instead."
1,Let's be honest,Gary D. is cute and stupid like we expect. The action is cheesy and poorly directed like we expect. But we really all should be tired of teachers driving a Mercedes and living in a million dollar home. Don't rent it. Really.
5,Acu-rite 00616 instead,"I cannot comment on this unit, but I have had the Acu-rite 00616 for four years in the Seattle area and now back in Florida. This has been a five star unit but alas the receiving unit just died. Battery life was like a once a year endeavor. I hope that Amazon will again stock it. In the meantime, I did find one on Ebay and am having it shipped. If you can lay your hands on one, you will not be disappointed."
2,Compiler's comments,"Compiled in 1986, hard cover, about 100 pages with photos. Printed by McNaughton & Gunn of Ann Arbor, MI. Some copies still available from author. Don't know how it got posted on Amazon. (843) 884-5076."
2,Code doesnt work!!!,"I bought this book also for its case-study approach. At first glance, it appears very useful but when you actually try to work with the source code, it has major problems. I guess it still has some value because you can kind of go through the code, but it irks me that they do not provide a working example. It appears to me that the code was written with the beta version of .net which is all fine and dandy, but they really should post a working version of the code... I am attempting to get the code to work, so I guess about the only positive thing you can say is its giving me much experience debugging... But to me there are an unacceptable amount of errors in the source code, stuff thats just way out in left field.I emailed the authors and I got a response saying that they have a ""working version "" of the code and expected to be posting the code on the internet ""soon""...Hmm..."
5,Incredible book!,"This is the most amazing book I've ever read. Mr. Halpin writes with amazing honesty about his experience, without whitewash or apology. The book bounces back and forth between hilarious episodes that are all the more funny because often the people around them don't get it, to the laid-bare terror of dealing with cancer in someone you love and can't imagine living without. I can't stand sentimental books, and this isn't one, and yet some of his revelations took my breath away with their poignancy and honesty. I tend to be a library borrower rather than a book buyer, but this is one to own."
3,maurice freedman,i think this is the only book on maurice freedman. he is an interesting modernist artist.
5,Stupendous,"If you appreciate the finest in saxophone playing, jazz composition and distinctive orchestras, then you MUST MUST MUST listen to this unique album. I first saw Odean Pope play with Max Roach about 25 years ago in Chicago and was utterly amazed at Pope's technical command of the instrument (he is by far the master of circular breathing). Then I was utterly astonished when I heard a recording of his Saxophone Choir about 12 years ago - and I have always been a huge fan of the World Saxophone Quartet. Given the paucity of Pope on disc, the jazz world is in for a thrill with this live album from a date at the Blue Note (I wish I had been there). The only quibble is that a number of the pieces have been recorded by Pope's Saxophone Choir before, but that's a bit like complaining that Ellington recorded ""Take the A Train"" too often!! Besides, the personnel on these versions is the best ever."
5,Fun!,I have had my player for about a week and I have to say it is really nice. The sound is great and it's easy to use...What more could you want? If you want something that is just as good as the high priced deals without the high price get this one. I am VERY HAPPY with this purchase.
3,A fun tale of personal triumph,"Beautiful Quotes:""I keep thinking about a tale my nurse used to read to me about a bird whose wings are pinned to the ground. In the end, when he finally frees himself, he flies so high he becomes a star. My nurse said the story was about how we all have something that keeps us down.""""There you go...let it all slide out. Unhappiness can't stick in a person's soul when it's slick with tears [p. 173].""I had heard that Shannon Hale's youth fiction was pretty good so I decided to try out this one. I'd read her Austenland book about a year ago and thought it was OK so I was a bit hesitant to try out her other books. Overall, I thought this was a fun book. It took a bit for me to get into it, but towards the end it really came alive. I thought Hale's book did a fantastic job of painting the tiny village of Mount Eskel for me to see. Her book focuses on the importance of family, community ties, and being true to yourself. A great story of triumph for those of all ages!"
4,Enough to think about,"While the book is sometimes a bit over the top, it is still fascinating and scary as well. One review tried to compare Iran with Iraq by mentioning WMD's. A simple, partisan comment. Everyone knows Iran is building weapons because THEY HAVE SAID SO. I wish there was more documentation for his 9/11 connection claims. It is distracting there aren't any that will allay nagging doubts. However, this subject of Iranian nuclear capability needs to be carefully watched. They do not need to use those weapons to threaten us. With them, and without a response from us, their influence will grow throughout the Arab world. Then all those who see only evil in US policies will have the real comparison that clear thinking people have always seen between radical Islam and Western style democracy."
3,Great writing overshadowed by some very lacking art,"Don't let the eye popping cover art fool you, the art contained in Elektra: The Scorpion Key is very lacking to say the least. Chuck Austen (current writer of Uncanny X-Men, and writer/artist for U.S. War Machine) has never been anywhere near solid as an artist before he became an exclusive writer, and it shows here in this book collecting the first few issues of Elektra relaunched under the Marvel Knights banner. Brian Michael Bendis (Daredevil, Alias, Ultimate Spider-Man) has a very well crafted story here, but the disfigured art drags it down. Were it not for Bendis' stellar (as usual) writing, this book wouldn't be worth reading, but if you can get past Austen's art, this is worth reading for Elektra and Daredevil readers."
3,Pei Pei,"About architecture and a man whos got what it takes to sweep those commissions his way! I M may be from the old architecture school, but its good to watch him talk about how he interacts with his clients. I didnt know much about his work apart from the Louvre, and its rather nice to see his other projects. Pristine, clean with a slight technical twist, I M's work is quite a legacy. If youre not from the design and architecture backgrounds, the DVD might be a bit boring and long drawn for you."
2,"It arrived with a moldy case, and the pegs are unusable","One thing is to recieve a cheap product and another is receive something that's molding through. I had to wash the canvas ""case"" from the molding on it, as well as rub down the violin and stuff. I thought I was getting a half priced 100$ quality violin, but I really received something worth about half of the 60 something that I paid.Sound quality is pretty nice, however the biggest issue is that the violin won't stay tuned for longer than 2 minutes. The pegs are garbage and I am still trying to find a way to make this violin playable."
3,"Nothing remarkable, certainly not for Extreme Ops","I purchased several of these to give as casual gifts for co-workers. I find a knife a very useful tool. There's nothint special about these S&W knives. In fact I find them somewhat below S&W standard having owned a fantastic one. There's nothing inherently wrong, the steel is adequate and comes utility sharp. I haven't and won't bother to put a keener edge on any. Relatively inexpensive, if it breaks you won't care very much, but expensive enough you should expect it to not fall apart on you. I'm wouldn't want to rely on it in a pinch, but it's adequate for day to day or light industrial use. Stamped patterned metal grips not effective in extreme cold or when wet."
5,Fantastic Grammar book!,"I just bought this book for my Advanced grammar class and I absolutely love it.I really like the way it is written. It is very easy to understand. I studied French since I was little but at the same time I have been studying English. As a result I have forgotten French a lot, especially grammar. This book has helped me to review what I have learned in the past. It has helped me to refresh my memory. This is the second week I am using this book and I am entirely satisfied with its content and the method that is used in helping students learn and master their grammar.In addition, I really like the way the book starts with a simple grammatical rules such as nouns and pronouns. Often times, students have difficulties mastering those kinds of simple rules even french native speakers.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is studying French. This book will help you sharpen your knowledge."
4,Content with product for cost,"The product arrived on time and in good shape. It was very easy to put together. It holds a good amount of sand for the kids to have plenty to play in. It was a little shorter than I anticipated, but I did not really look at the dimensions before I purchased it. The lid is a nice option but seems to need time for the elastic bands that keep it closed to stretch out a little. It is challenging to get the lid on at first, but anticipate it will get easier with time. Overall, it is a great product. My kids enjoy playing in it and it is really nice to have the toys provided with the table. I much prefer this to a sand box that they can climb into. Much quicker clean up. I would recommend it for a family who is looking for a fun and creative way to get your kids outside, using their hands and being creative!"
4,Not so noise canceling.,"These headphones have terrific bass, great sound quality, and are very durable. Although they do cancel some of the noise, a lot still gets through. If you are looking for silence I suggest you spring for an expensive Bose pair. But if you are a broke college kid, these are by far the best headphones you can get for the price!"
2,A very long run for a short slide....,"Very little actual running here. Mostly a Nike commercial. Lots of silly interviews that don't add anything. Watch one of the movies, instead."
5,excellent,"bon jovi did it again.you can always expect an excellent album from this band.. bounce is an exceptional album.. all the songs are great.... misunderstood, joey, bounce , hook me up, everyday,..just to name a few ..are all very good songs. cant wait to see the boys in jersey this february..."
3,London cast now available,"The London cast recording in English, circa 1972, is now available on cd in a limited edition from Kritzerland. Google Kritzerland if interested. I am not affiliated with them."
3,Massive talent and yet...,"I can't but agree with the other reviewer. I knew these guys from England in the early 70s. True, they go everywhere (""discontinuity"") but here and there (for instance, ""Isadora"", ""Bathers""--the latter is ..well, almost more pop but what depth in this voice and the theme itself is esoteric--who knows of Lake Balathon), they really display impressive stuff. So, three stars is correct, unfortunately. Yet, I never gave up this album and ""Snafu"" which I bought 30-35 years ago as a kid (or so) and That may say something..."
4,Funny,"Countdown to Liquor Day was funny TPB but it wasn't as funny as the series or the Christmas movie. They didn't have many Rickyisms and J Roc wasn't as crazy as he normally is. Mr. Lahey is drunk and hilarious as usual. Not the best TPB installment, but makes you wish they were still making the series."
1,Read the SELLER reviews!,"The product shown and described is not what you get. They send loose, most likely used, balls with corporate sponsorship logos printed on them. I am not kidding. I don't know where they got their hands on these, but these are not new balls. They showed up in a paper mailer. You will be disappointed and have to go through a lengthy process just to get your money back."
4,Very enjoyable CD!,"This CD, in my opinion contains 5 really outstanding tracks. The singles ""Satelite"", and ""Ease the Pressure"" are both great upbeat tracks. My favorite track however, is ""Deliver Me"", which was meant by the band to be the second single. It is very simple and very beautiful. ""Missing You"" and ""For Your Love"" are both great tracks with cool beats. The other tracks don't have quite the same effect on me, but they are each interesting in their own way, and altogether this is a very good album. I would say that I do like ""Conscience"" even better, however. I can't wait for them to someday finish their next album."
3,Nice cases but not a very nice price--ANYWHERE,If you need the space and like your DVDs in one case(each case stores 2) and a durable plastic clear outer case for cover art then this is the best deal I could find.I'll be honest the price is not worth it unless you really need the standard size cases..The 5 DVD cases are MUCH cheaper and just as durable.I needed the space so I paid the price
3,Useful,"The Thera Cane is useful in getting to places that are difficult alone and I have followed the instructions and watched the DVD. That being said I haven't found it to be very useful is reducing the pain I have had in my upper back, neck and shoulders. It feels good as you work the area but in the long term I have not seen it's effectiveness."
1,Not Thankful For The Change,"I heard 'Incredible God, Incredible Change' on my car radio and went to the nearest Christian music store to purchase it. I just had to have that song right away, no delay. Well, I picked up 'It's Time For A Change' by mistake and I can't wait until it's time to make the exchange. But, I'm glad it did get good reviews from others who bought it. Actually, this is the first time I'd heard Youthful Praise and I wish them all the best, but I can truthfully say that I've never had a CD that I liked less than this one. Not one cut inspired me to keep it, as it got toward the end the vocals became so grating and harsh that screaming along with them was all I wanted to do. I'm so thankful that the owner of the store is gracious enough to replace it with the other one, at least I know that I'll absolutely love 'Incredible God'."
5,Dance album of the year!,"Wow! ...finally something new and creative for the dance floors this year. Got a promo of this album about a week ago and havn't stopped listening to it since. All of Mynt's hits in one place plus their new single ""Still Not Sorry"" which I think is really going to be a huge smash for them. Lot's of cool 80's production and fat synths on this one and I'd say it's definitely a worth while buy if u are into dance music/electrohouse 80's style./DJ Eric"
2,Doesn't Deliver,"This book sounds great, but sadly doesn't come close to what it could be. The author repeatedly leads the reader and then does not follow through. It almost seems that the author is too concerned about offending people and is afraid to go to the place he wants to go with the plot. He skirts around things and does not provide enough hard fact and detail to support his story. Either you ""go there"" or you don't, but make it clear. Disappointing read."
3,Different,Its a long time since I read Nancy Drew. This one was scarier than others that I have come across and there was a good twist with the scarecrow
4,Very Educational:),"This is a great toy! It is very educational, and the music is not ""annoying"" as some of the musical toys are. This ones volume adjusts to high or low. And it has the music mode or alphabet mode. My son loves the music mode, he stands there and bobs back and forth everytime the toy is on. He loves it and I think it is definatly worth the money. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is the fact that ""I"" don't think the legs are very sturdy. My son was almost 11 months when he started walking, and he had been standing for months. When he use to stand there it made me nervous because he would just about pull it over on himself! I think if your child is pulling himself or herself up on things, I would take two of the legs off so it is kinda on the floor!"
2,Not sweet enough.,Not as sweet as sugar or Splenda. Had to use quite a bit in my tea. I won't buy again.
4,Short Life: 3 Years,"Mine is the Olympus U 700 All-Weather 7.1 Megapixels. I loved this camera and do not know what the normal lifespan of a camera like this is. It lasted 3 years. It just suddenly ""died"", the screen went blue with a few numbers on it. I've been told it could be the lense, in which case, it would cost around US$100 to have repaired."
5,An Inexpensive Yet Valuable Add-On to Your Track,"The GeoTrax Rail n Road System is a super toy for toddlers age 2 1/2 and up. The toys are durably-constructed and they develop physical coordination and design creativity each time your child rearranges the tracks.That said, both the Tracktown Railway and Working Town starter sets eventually show their limitations because there's only so much you can do with the track pieces provided. That's when add-ons like this one become so valuable.The real treat of this set is the additional pair of switches. Used in conjuction with any of the GeoTrax train sets, your child will be able to dream up many more layouts with these two vital pieces. Two additional curves and straight bridges are also included. The remaining pieces are scene decorations - trees and signs - that kids will love to place throughout their new world.This affordable add-on will open up lots of new possibilities for any existing GeoTrax setup."
5,Filled a hole . . .,"I had happily gave my DVD of this movie to friends , as a family movie that I highly recommend! I've missed it so much I had to get me another. It's one of the few movies that I enjoy enough to watch again!"
5,"Warne Quality, solid","I installed these mounts with a Redfield Revenge 6-18 x 44mm Varmint on Warne 2 piece bases onto a Howa 1500 .243 heavy barrel. It went easy for the install. I had a few options for ring to scope spacing based on how I installed the bases to get the best eye relief and Objective to barrel clearance. They seem solid and I hope to fire it this weekend to get it zeroed in. I can't imagine I'll have any issues. Great product, Quality for sure.William"
5,An ideal text for self-instruction,"Expertly compiled, organized, and presents by William Bay, ""Mel Bay's Complete Book of Guitar Chords, Scales And Arpeggios"" is a 298-page compendium of diagrams showing the aspiring guitar player how to produce just the right sounds from their instruments whether in practice or in performance. Each major and minor scale is presented in position on the guitar fingerboard with all scales being shown in diagram form, notation, and tablature. Of special not is the section on blues and rock scales. Thoroughly 'user friendly', ""Mel Bay's Complete Book of Guitar Chords, Scales And Arpeggios"" is provides an ideal text for self-instruction, and is very highly recommended as a curriculum supplement for mastering classic, rock, blues, and other forms of guitar music."
5,Comix touchstone.,"For me and many comics guys, a touchstone work that spiralled my interest away from the juvenile houses of Marvel, DC to real, mature work. Is a Pulitzer enough?It's a story of a father and son as much of as a Holocaust survivor, warts and all.Get it. You will not be disappointed"
1,"Trapped in ""Robert Jordan Syndrome""??????","Poor Terry Goodkind, the publishing company wants lots of pages from him but he hasn't quite figured out what comes next in the story. Well, just put Richard in danger, take lots of pages to get him out, explain how killing actually supports the value of life and use about 4 of those pages to move the bigger story a baby step along. Oh, and since it is the eighth book, be sure to mention the Wizards Eighth Rule, just in case someone is nostalgic for a worthy book.It all sounds a lot like what Robert Jordan has been going through the last few books. Save your money. Hopefully both authors will get past the celebrity and get back to telling us the real story. I still have hope but it's fading."
2,Very basic,"This booklet is very basic. No intro, no explanation of rational for information provide, just a list of actions to take with your dog. Even worse, I think much of this information is based on some outdated ideas and a belief that dogs behave just like wolves. To compound matters she simpifies (or misunderstands) wolf behave in such a way that her adivse is really not very useful. For example, I don't really think my dog wants on the couch because sitting on it is somehow a status symbol to her. She likes sitting on the couch because it is comfortable and she gets to be near her people."
1,not a good read,"The author works for Focus on the Family, which should be a big hint about the content.At one point, in the conclusion, he essentially gives parents permission to spy on their kids! And if your kid is obsessed with death and dying, you have a MUCH bigger problem than Wicca. Plus, that kid is goth. There's a difference.He's really out to scare parents more than anything. Most of what he says is deliberately not going one way or the other.Read another book if you want to learn more about Wicca."
3,good for a kid,I bought this little cartoon paperback for my grandson. When I asked him what he wanted & he said 2 of these little books. I checked with his mother first because I didn't know what they were & she said fine. They are just cartoon. He's a young teenager.
3,It's been along time since high school,"I'm not sure what happened. I loved this book in high school. Wanting to read it forty years later was a mistake on my part. It's Throreau for goodness sakes, you have to read at least once. Twice? Nu uh."
5,Not easy...in a good way,"I was pleasantly surprised by this video. I am not a fitness guru by any means, but I consider myself in pretty good shape. I was worried any pregnancy workout would be too easy, but this one is not. I do mostly the beginner moves now, and it is not easy. I am glad, too, that there are two other levels to move up to. Combined with some cardio, this workout should have anyone's pregnant body looking great. It is a bit strange because there is a voice over; the person in the video is not talking while showing you the moves. It is also not set up like a traditional workout video; there is not much preparation for different moves, but after only a couple of times, you know what comes next. Also, it is helpful to know that you will need a chair, a mat, and large pillows. Also, if you want to do any of the intermediate or advanced moves, you will need a stair step and hand weights."
1,Nothing but cherry candy!,"These did nothing for my sore throat! I wouldn't be able to tell the difference between these, and cherry Life Savers. Do not buy these. I'll stick with Hall's from now on."
4,Want a road map of Michigan ?,"As an ex-michigander who frequently travels back home, I like this atlas. If you are looking for things to do on vacation in Michigan buy something else. This is basically a road map (note publication date - newer roads won't be there!). I've even found some driveways on it. I like to take alternate or scenic by-ways between points A and B. ""Top"" bike trails, Hiking, canoeing spots etc. are also mentioned. After years of vacationing in one spot we found some new things to explore with this. If you are a park and hike type explorer this is it. If you want to get off the beaten track you need this. If you're looking for a travel guide, look elsewhere."
5,Great Gift Idea,I ordered this for a book baby shower present. I thought this was a nice item to have for a new family to have to add to the wonder of Christmas.
3,Knife Sharpener,"Actually, this is one of the few items I've purchased from Amazon & was disappointed. In my opinion, it's an average, at best, knife sharpener. Going by the previous reviews, I thought this would be a great sharpener for our hunting / skinning knives. After the first few cuts, I switched back to our old sharpener. I'll keep it in the kitchen for light work, but it's not going to work on the big stuff."
2,"Strange book, not sure it was worth the effort","This was a difficult read. I've never read Allende before so I assumed that maybe the problem was in a translation or something. And then I read the other customer reviews which says that this is simply not her best book. On that, I can't comment. But this was not my favorite either. I was tempted to abandon the book at several points. It got mildly intriguing when the ""California gold rush"" got underway, and I found this book to take so many bizarre turns, I stuck with it. I think Allende was trying to make too many statements about disjointed social issues and ultimately, her point got lost entirely. There's social class issues, gender issues, race issues, moral issues (the prostitutes were memorable), ethnic issues and on and on. What was her point? ...Don't know if I can recommend this one."
3,I bought this book for TPI knowledge.,"I agree with most of the other reviews. If you have the spare coin, get this book and read it.However, if you dont ever read this book, you will not die (nor will your engine).Theres some nice tips and tricks in here. But nothing really profound. Lots of bolt on combination advice that I suppose is sound.I bought the book because I am building a TPI motor. This book did help me understand how the TPI can and cant be modified in terms of cams and heads. Ofcourse, any mods will require a PROM tweak. He mentions this but doesnt cover it, understandably as its not within the scope of this book.One thing ive learned over the years. When you get advice from the top dawgs like Lingenfelter, Yunick, Edelbrock, etc.... the advice is geared to build max power at a screaming 6000-8000rpm (or so). For me personally, this advice is amusing, but not at all useful. I only ever build strong daily drivers (that must be efficient). Never seeing 5000rpm, much less 8000. lol"
1,A bomb waiting to explode,"There are 2 types of SD Fans in the world. One which loved this movie, one that loathed this movie. SD fans will be quick to pick up on the ""homage/tribute"" (what the director likes to call it), which brings forward the idea that this is a ""great"" movie for SD fans. Wrong. The ""homage/tribute"" is washed away so quickly from the mind, as you are constantly questioning when would Shaggy and Scooby compete in a farting contest, or when velma would be dancing in a womens shower room dressed a bikini (A scene cut from the movie, as it was deemed inapropiate for a pg rating).As a stand-alone movie, this is one to avoid. As a movie for fan purposes, this varies depending upon how long you have grown up with scooby-doo, or if you can ever imagine your favorite saturday morning cartoon revamped, and forced to sell drug/sex humor to audinces"
4,I Liked It****,My best friend loves this movie. I liked it. It has its funny parts. Good to watch once every few years. Better to rent than own in my opinion.
2,DOES NOT WORK WITH GATEWAY T1616,"This doesn't work correctly with a Gateway T1616. One stick will work on the first RAM Slot, but it will not work in the second RAM slot. However, the ram does work. I tried it on an HP laptop that works succesfull. And, the motherboard of the T1616 works with samsung 1 gig in each slot. But doesn't work when you place crucial's 1 gig in the second slot."
4,Where's the classic Rockman?,"This should be five stars but Tom wanted to go with a heavy bass sound and hide the harmonies and layered crunch that everyone loves.Even if Brad isn't on the album,it could have been redeemed by altering the sound.It's the classic crunch that everyone loves.Tom says he wants the albums to sound different and I can see th point.Zeppelin did this on every album but they still rocked.These guys were great on this tour and these songs were equally great.Don't overlook ""I Need Your Love"" and the ""Walk On "" medley.Just the classic crunch would improve these songs so much."
4,More of the same from Clancy,"The book was a bit long, and could have been edited by a couple of hundred pages. It was, though, very entertaining and a great story."
3,Great Concept but....,"I love the concept behind this series but, it seems to me that Rachel just gets dumber by the minute. How many deals can one person make with demons. It seems that she never thinks about the consequences of her actions. She only deals with the aftermath of what she has done after the fact.I am not even going to comment on the ""Ivy"" factor. I feel bad for her and I don't think that Rachel takes into account her feelings or how the way she flaunts her ""male"" relationships in front of her affects her.I do hope that as the series continues she finally gets a clue!"
3,Not the best but still beter than moto,"I just got my v510 and learned quickly that the buttons like many of the reveiws said are very hard to operate. I have a razor v3 phone and it doesn't seem to work very well with it. I have to push the voice dial button on my phone in order to make voice dialed calls which is inconveinent, the connect button on my doesn't connect very well. I got this hoping to be totally handsfree and its not! This is the reason I am giving it a 3. The sound quality is good and the clairty of calls is great, again better then my moto bluetooth device. Its very comfortable also. It almost has more cons than pros. It paired up with my phone easily but again not total hands free. I don't know that I would buy another even though the clarity, wind reduction feature and over all comfort of the device was good."
2,Not A Good Primer,"If you are looking for a book on Tantra proper, this is not the right book for you. The questions posed are seldom answered in a thorough fashion and there is a negative/catty tone which prevails through the entire book which is rather tiresome.The claim posed by the authors that this is ""the only book on Tantra you will ever need"" is downright ignorant as topics specific to Tantra are only explored in very vague terms. A thorough explanation is sacrificed for the sake of an account of the personal spiritual path pursued by authors.There is a general occult bad-boy-ism employed here that will appear adolescent unless you find yourself profoundly fettered by Judeo-Christian conditioning."
1,Don't Bother,"I've never bothered to review a book that i didn't like, but I had to keep others from making the same mistake i did.The fact that this book is so old should have tipped me off. The information is way out of date. Even if it was up to date, it's way too basic even for an unsophisticated searcher like me.I expected it to be a step by step on how to research and use sites, but it is just lacking.There are better books on Amazon for doing legal research on theinternet."
4,5-year-old's mom,"O.K., so it is a little inane. It's also a lot of fun, especially read aloud. My son is on his second listening, and loves to giggle as we go along. What's nice for little kids is that there are no scary parts, but there is still suspense. And I love the little girl with her personal weather system."
5,one of the greatest hard rock albums,"machine head is amongst my favourite hard rock albums.deep purple is my favourite band and this is their masterpiece.this classic album contains all their hits like highway star,space truckin and smoke on the water which is one of the greatest rock songs ever made.ignore the one star reviews and get this brilliant album.hugely recommended."
1,"Not ready for ""prime time""!","I'd like to think that I'm a fair minded person, but as hard as I try, I can't think of anything positive to say about this expensive paperweight! It has little, if any, discernment over which sounds are your commands, and which are the sounds from the television/audio center...and that's if you can get so far as to get it to do ANYTHING but flash the LED light. Operations defined in the manual often don't coincide with what happens when you follow the instructions and press the keys. It simply is a bad piece of product design, however well thought out it may have been, in the concept stages.To make matters worse, just try accessing the manufacturer's web site. They're either down, or already are out of business...Avoid this device like the plague!"
1,The critics are as right as ever.,"Gone in 60 Seconds is without a doubt the worst Bruckheimer action film (Coyote Ugly is probably Bruckheimer's worst overall). The problem with this flick isn't just the fact that it's stupid, but also because it's boring. There's a lack of excitement in the entire movie. It' just not worth watching."
2,Too boring.,"I consider myself a lover a children's animated features, and when a movie puts me to sleep, that says it all."
1,What a waste of time!,"Well, that's part of my life I'll never get back! I can't figure out why this movie got such great reviews; I was totally bored by it. Don't waste your time; there are a lot of other movies out there that are better than this junk."
1,Buyer beware!,"This is a great story, for the most part, by an excellent author. Problem is that there was a glitch in assembly and the middle of the book is from Fever, 1793. So Amazon replaced my book and the replacement was also faulty. They are pulling the copies they have so this won't happen again. I ended up buying a copy of Fever because the part I read in the middle of Turnabout was so good! Anything by Margaret Haddix Peterson is excellent! She often deals with time and that's one of my favorite topics."
3,Better than the last two.,"Anne Rice may need to branch out and find another genre. While this book has lovely imagery, it lacks the page turning suspense of The Witching Hour and the senuality of The Vampire Chronicles. Triana is an average heroine at best. Wait for the paperback version."
5,It's amazing!,"I absolutely adore this CD. The show is in London now and I'm dying to see it. The music is so powerful especially ""Endless Night"" and ""He Lives In You (reprise)"". It's one of the best CD's I've got and I have a lot! If you love the film - you'll certainly love this CD even though a lot of songs are different. It's very strong and powerful, the cast are FAB!"
3,Def. A great Classic Rock Gem!,"Orginally,wasn't too familiar with the allman brothers band. I'd heard of them,but was not really in the mood to download them since I have ton of old music that i listen to. I decided to get their best hits album, and I thought most of it was pretty good. I really enjoy their rough garage rock sound, and though the lead singer's vocals were pretty standard for a rock singer. I was afraid that this album would be a bit too much on the country side, but I was glad that they didn't stray away from the rock sound. Overall, my favorite songs that I really like were southbound ramblin man, and whipping post. I really liked the folksy blueness of this band. They seem to remind me alot of the Doobie Brothers which were propably competing against them in the charts during this time frame."
4,great boost,GV was recommended to me by my nutritionist and I haven't looked back since then. It's a natutal energy boost before or after the gym
1,POR FAVOR QUE PORQUERIA....,"THALIA NUNCA HA SIDO UNA BUENA CANTANTE Y SUS DISCOS SIEMPRE HAN SIDO MALOS, PERO ESTE ULTIMO HA LLEGADO MUY LEJOS. EL DISCO ES MALISIMO, LA MUSICA ES CORRIENTE Y LAS CANCIONES TONTAS. ME ARREPIENTO TOTALMENTE DE HABER MALGASTADO MI DINERO EN ESTA PORQUERIA."
1,Black Tongue Cha Cha,"Really, trading slightly whiter teeth for a black tongue is not worth the trouble.I have a terrible taste in mouth, a stained tongue that looks like cha-cha dancers have done a once over in the middle of the night...Not for the faint of heart!"
3,Braun MX2050 PowerMax Jug Blender,The blender is very strong and is working very well.The Glass Jug is too heavey and would be better served as a plastic.The Knob is hard to change when your hands are wet.Buttons I think are better.Over all I would say it is a very good deal for the cost of the mixer.
4,the chinese cocteau,"I have been a huge fan of the cocteau twins since the beginning. I thought i owned just about everything they had out. When they broke up i started following robin guthries career, his solo work is like an instrumental cocteau twins. I had recently found out they had collaberated with faye wong, (she is huge in china!) She is probably the only singer that can mimic elizabeth frasers lovely voice. THis import cd is very pricey, but if you are a huge cocteau fan, its a must. THe cocteau twins only produce two tracks on this album. One track is an original and the other is a remake of a cocteau b-side. She sings in manderin, which few will understand what she is singing. But for true cocteau fans, that doesnt matter because elizabeth fraser sings in her own language, that few people understand. The rest of the album has a big cocteau feel and is pretty good to. Go ahead and give her a try."
2,Brush Roll Problems,"I, like a lot of other reviewers out there, bought this vacuum on the advice of Consumer Reports. They had it listed as their ""best buy."" They definitely messed up on this one.I have experienced a substantial amount of belt slippage on my vacuum. In my opinion, it is just bad design. There are no gears on the belt. It is a smooth belt turned by a smooth motor shaft. No wonder it slips.I ended up taking my vacuum into a service center to assist me with replacing the belt. I was not encouraged by his comment that ""that thing is a piece of junk."" He thought I would get two years out of it, tops. He says that he does a lot of brush roll replacements on them because the design of it allows pet hair to become trapped in the ends of the brush roll.I have come to learn that if you want a good vacuum, you need to spend $300 or more. I think I will consult with a different source than Consumer Reports on my next vacuum purchase, too."
4,Worked beautifully,I used this make up for a wedding. It'a a little thicker so I had better coverage to hide my freckles. It worked out beautifully.
1,Poor Customer Service,I bought a cross-cut shredder from Royal and it did not hold up. Soon after I bought it the shredder stopped working reliably. The machine would feed paper in fits and starts and usually only half way shred a page. The machine has been nothing but frustration. I recieved poor support from Royal customer service. They hide behind warranty fine print details at the expense of customer satisfaction. I would never buy another product made by Royal. Buyer Beware!
1,Crazy prices!!,I'm not sure where this company got there prices from because I just bought this at Walmart for $4.45. I would suggest shopping around before you purchase from JNL.
1,Same thing - worked initially and now doesn't,"I don't know if it is the sweeper or the battery, probably the battery, but after a short period of use it does not work at all. The brushes were cleaned. There is no logical reason for it to not work. I am very disappointed in this product."
1,Very poorly done,"This is a sad example of a movie. It had no rhythm, pace, storytelling or engaging acting/characters. None of the required elements to make a good movie even came close to sneaking into this one. The movie drags and drags through alternate haunted infirmary then police interview, back and forth incessantly. It flips back and forth so often that the entire story flow is destroyed. Further, there's no horror. Its at least 40 minutes into the movie before anything even remotely interesting happens, far too long. The acting is terrible. The interrogating cop, for example, should never set foot on a film set again. Avoid at all costs."
1,Bad bars!!!!,"These bars were old and had a really dry taste, and had a grey discolration to the outer of the chocolate. I think they were missing the plastic wrap to the entire box which keeps them fresh. The other box I've ordered in the past had this freshness wrap and these did not. They were bad bars."
3,"Love Perry, but not Paragon Walk",Although I am a huge fan of Perry -- both the Pitt series and the darker William Monk series -- this one had such an obvious plot flaw from the very beginning I was disappointed. But I'll continue to read Perry's work. I love Charlotte's clever way of getting around the Victorian drawing room manners.
4,LOOKING FOR GOOD WISDOM TALES,"I'm always happy to find some new wisdom tales, and this book has a few that I haven't seen before. It was very helpful to have the guide for better storytelling.For those who like different tales, have you seen Ayat Jamilah: Beautiful Signs by Sarah Conover? It has tales from all over the world, and most of them are new to the written scene"
3,a decent read,"For some reason this book by Bram Stoker did not fulfill my high expectations for it. Many of my reading friends recommended the book so I was pleased to get a copy of the ebook and began reading it. Had some trouble keeping reading as I wanted to read other things and had to keep coming back to finish. It was ok but unfortunately for me it did not live up to what I had been led to expect.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
1,Dissapointing to say the least,"The text ""claims"" to come with Minitab 14 and thats exactly the reason I bought it. The CD only has tutorials which by their very nature are useless. Most of the pages in this book are dedicated to teaching ""how to use Minitab"". I feel the help options it the program itself are more informative not only about statistics in general but also how to generate desired tests on the program itself.Minitab is by far one of the most user friendly packages around, no tutorial book is essentially required to know the fundamental basics of using Minitab. 10 minutes of playing with it sould suffice for this whole book.Carver has obviously composed this book for either the computer illiterate or just to gain royalties. I sincerely dislike the very existence of this book."
4,A Good Buy,Was able to buy this for a pretty good price. Connected it to my phone without trouble. It is a little big but I like the pickup on it. My wife says the sound produced is a lot cleaner than my old bluetooth headset.
5,Since the last time,"Next to the Roots no hip hop ers can integrate live instuments into their music like Arrested Development. It is not as if AD or speech had stopped making music, just that they lost confidence in Americans, which had an ear towards Gangsta rap. I guess it is also a credit to Japanese sense of good music they AD Sold well in Japan. I had to order this Album online, cause most major CD stores would not stock it on their shelves..This album is well worth hearing and is very underrated. and they are clearly still inspired by the Sly & the Family Stone experience..... as well AD has inspired an entire slew of Southern style hip hop. Among the best songs on this album, check out song #4 Sao Paulo"
4,The hologram is a fine analogy,"I read this book as an avid student of holograms and was quite taken by the idea of us as holographic images. But I could not rid myself of the fact that the hologram is a projection of an image, not the subject of the image any more than is the person in a photograph. To me the true subject is captured in the wavefront. The wave front is the sum of experience, and it is in virtually constant processes of change. Any discrete image from the wavefront is likely to be similar to any other, but in its nature, never the same. That is the divinity of the matrix. We are all parts of it, but each is a discrete moment in the pattern of the wavefront. Arriving at that made the book a compelling read."
1,2 only,"i only got two in the mail shows four on order, dont know what happen to the other 2. maybe misinformed."
3,Good (not great) comic,"This is another perfectly enjoyable installment in the life of May ""Mayday"" Parker, the stunning Spider-Girl. If you've liked the prior volumes, you'll dig this one, too. Well paced story, fun art. Terrible paper they print these on, though. Maybe the cheaper paper stock keeps the price down. Definitely recommended for the younger set, so enjoy this one with your kids."
4,Super deal,"I can't believe how cheap these things are getting. I do think it's funny how styling is getting so ""i-Poddy."" As a PC user I'd prefer black or gray. But at this deal, I won't complain. Works great, and speedily enough."
1,Dudley Can't Do Right,"After I saw this movie once, I vowed never to see it again. Brendan Fraser is completely incompetent as an actor. Actually, he isn't even an actor. He's just somebody who happens to get filmed in a movie. He can't act. Will someone kindly inform he and his agent of this fact? He shows how much work the Canadian Mounties put into the job- nothing!DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE!!!"
4,impressed,"Seeing ""Higgins Clark"" on the cover I accidently picked this up thinking it was her former mother-in law. Being an avid Mary Higgins Clark reader I was pleasantly surprised with the results of this book. I found it as good, if not better, than some of the more recent elder Clark's books. A fresh new edge for ""clean"" mystery readers."
2,pass on this scanner,"We also use this scanner at work. The thing is horrible. We get error codes, it jams, software malfunctions (ie. ask it to scan and it shoots back an error, this even after re-installing the software). Only reason we have it is because it's a work-approved device...The reason for two stars: it can scan a document but only after too much work to get it to work."
4,Predictable but still a great story,The book was predictable in the beginning but still had great character development. Loved the main characters and how much small town charm was a part of the story.
5,Good Keeps Getting Better,"In his first album minus the band, Matthew Good delivers his best music yet and it seems as though Good just keeps getting ""Gooder"".From the moment you open the disc you know you're in for something better than just good...Something great. The artwork and imagery is excellent and the jacket design is somewhere on the brilliant side of the spectrum.But it's not all just eye candy. The lyrics and music are sweet to the ear, food for thought and substance for the soul.The songs all seem to be meticulously crafted to make you think while still allowing room for you to rock out to them. Make no mistake. This isn't flash-in the-pan pop.While this is definitely a ""play through"" disc, tracks worthy of mention include, ""Pledge of Allegiance"", ""Weapon"" and the excellent, insightful rant, ""21st Century Living"".Bottom Line: Matthew Good = Great"
5,perfect,I use these for wipes for baby because they are so soft and washable. I LOVE THEM! Perfect for cloth diapering mommies.
5,wonderful,I have never felt so secure and covered up while nursing my baby until I bought this nursing cover. I'm covered from the front and back.
1,Dangerous,"I bought this only a year and a half ago and it has worked fine- until this morning. While it was brewing I smelled plastic burning, went into the kitchen and saw that the machine was smoking from the bottom. I unplugged it and put it on the porch. Needless to say, it goes in the trash. I'm thankful it didn't start a fire. It had a shamefully short life esp. considering the expense. NOT recommended."
3,It's Okay,"Purity is just okay. I have all their other disks, and I still can't get enough of them. When I pop Purity into the player, I find my mind wandering away from the music, occasionally brought back to reality by an overly repetitive melody or wailing that lasts too long. Previous disks are amazing, but this one is pedantic, boring, and lackluster. Sorry, Mythos, better luck next time. Mythos, Reality of a Dreamer, and Eternity disks are fantastic. Purity is very disappointing."
3,workmanship,Nice bike looks great but not the best workmanship when it arrived it had a bent rear rim but for the price it is a good entry level bike
4,One of Perry's Best Pitt Thrillers,"I am a huge fan of Anne Perry. I have read all of her books and eagerly look forward to the next one. My actual favourite series is the William Monk series, but the Pitt ones are very good too. This particular one is a very good example of her style of writing and it would be a good book to read first in order to get into the series. Her writing puts the reader right there in Victorian England as no one else can. I never guessed what the motive could be at all and was suitably surprised with the last chapter. A really tight well-knit thriller."
4,"Yes, It's Short. We All Know It's Short. GET OVER IT!","I wish everybody would just SHUT-UP about this game's length. Rising Sun has been out for what, eight months now? So if you're still crying about how short it is then either you don't have a life or you've been living under a rock. I just bought my copy for $19.95 at EB Games and that's a fair price for what you get.Another complaint that's often repeated in these reviews is how ""stupid the enemy is"", always running toward you. THAT'S WHAT JAPANESE SOLDIERS DID, you idiot! There not running toward you to shake your hand--they're trying to impale you with their bayonets! Get a clue.If you're a fan of World War II games (especially historically acurate World War II games), then Rising Sun should find a welcome home in your collection. It may be shorter than it's predecessor, Frontline, but the graphics, sound (THX!) and multi-player are definately an improvement. So get off your high-horse already and buy this game."
5,Love It!,"I love this steamer! I've had the larger size for years, but wanted a smaller second steamer for smaller portions. Perfect size for one to three people. Easy to use and makes great rice too."
1,Turbocharge? Depends on your interpretation of the word.,"As a marketing communications practitioner, I too was impressed with Vitale's web site, and agree that some of his online tips are quite useful and insightful. However, Vitale's ""instant writing method,"" described in Turbocharge Your Writing, isn't really insightful or new. This book tells you what to do to get started on your writing project. If you already know that you need to organize your thoughts pre-writing, and that you need to write and re-write, and that you need to step away from, and then return to your work with a fresh view, then you don't need this. If you're hoping to find suggestions for enlivening or punching up your writing, I'd try one of Vitale's other books. However, if you're completely (and I mean, completely) new to the writing practice, maybe this will help you get started."
1,Big disappointment,"I have owned every version of Simcity. By and large, they have all been very well done and obviously well-tested. This version is neither. So far, one patch has been released and another is imminent because of severe problems with performance and gameplay. It is apparent from gameplay that playtesting prior to release was insufficient. The time it takes to master this game, assuming that is even possible, is far too lengthy to make Simcity 4 enjoyable.Given how many people are likely to be turned off by this release, we may be seeing the end of what was once the best sim series in gaming."
4,"good but no ""masterpiece""","Good: the underlying real-worldliness of the film---the premise that everybody lies to everybody else and themselves, that friends are friends from one moment to the next not forever, that in life there is no forever but only a string of moments and therefore we must learn to live and love accordingly.The sex scenes have a refreshing realism to them, there's none of the MTV-stylized fake glamour designed to titillate repressed American audiences. It's just people being people physically enjoying people...nothing more, nothing less, no inhibitions but also no pretensions either.Why no ""masterpiece""---poor film editing makes for several slow and over-long scenes. This movie feels longer than it is, just doesn't flow as well as another recent (much closer to ""masterpiece"" status) Mexican film, ""Amor es perros."" That being said, the characters are brilliantly cast and you could do much, much worst than watching this movie."
2,horse sense,"While Stevie prepares games for an upcoming gymkana, Lisa develops a constitution for the Saddlel Club, and Carole prepares the stable mare Delilah for her upcoming birth. The girls get so caught up in their own projects that they forget to stick together. It takes the birth of the foal to show the girls they're better off when they pull together."
5,UN DISCO DE LO MEJOR,"Es un gran disco. Al oir las primeras canciones uno se da cuenta de la evolución que tiene el grupo. De lo mejor que hay en el mercado. Si lo ven, no lo piensen dos veces y comprenlo, no se arrepentiran. Todavía existen algunos grupos originales y que hacen musica de calidad, y KABAH es uno de esos grupos. Es el único grupo pop que no es prefabricado, hacen su música, escriben sus canciones y son ellos mismos, no como otros.Es bastante bueno y de los mejores."
4,Yea.. Clean Carpet,Easy to assemble. Easy to use. and best of all this cleaner got pet stains out of the carpets that the professional carpet cleaner did not.
5,Great Movie,I'm just browsing through older movies to see what I could find from the past that I forgot about. This one blew my mind. I remember it. Definitely a classic movie in my opinion. I'm gonna watch again.
2,Defective on arrival,"As others have said, the best thing about this clock is that I was able to see the huge numbers without my glasses. It's also nice that the time is automatically set out of the box. I did find the numbers to be a bit too bright though.The real problem is that on arrival I noticed the numbers on the clock were flickering a bit. Not too badly at first, but definitely noticeable. In the middle of the night, the clock woke me up by making a high pitched whining noise. I pulled the plug and returned it the next day. At least the return was easy, and I bought a different clock that I ended up liking better."
5,Little Tykes table and Chairs,"The table and chairs have the same high quality of the product I bought 30 years ago for my child. The table was easy to put together and can be used indoors and outdoors. Would have liked it if it came with four chairs instead of two, though."
1,book cover,"I returned this book cover because it was totally inadequate-the kindle just DOES NOT stay attached securely. Unfortunately, they charged me a restocking fee which I feel was unjust since the product did not do what it was supposed to (i.e. hold the kindle securely)"
2,Not for people who want to think...,"Three words: money making machine.This movie is realy great for CNN and MTV generation: lot of action, very few thoughs.Don't get me wrong: movie is ok (especialy for gore movie lovers). Director, operator and main actor did their best. But all this hysteria about move is just a very, very good entertainment and marketing. (Bravissimo, marketing heads!)If you realy want to think about ""great and eternal"" things, watch Antonioni, Pasolini, Scorsese, Bergman, De Sica etc. works.Even ""Finding Nemo"" is more about faith, than Gibson's movie."
3,Pinzon Sheets,"The sheets were good. they were cut full big, in fact too large on thefitted bottom sheet, otherwise they were ok."
1,Not a substitute for the original!,"This review refers *only* to the Ramble House / Fender Tucker edition, 2005/6.I bought this edition from the publisher (Ramble House / Fender Tucker) in May 2006. I compared it carefully with my copy of the original edition (1939). I was disappointed to find HUNDREDS OF ERRORS in the Ramble House edition -- including some real howlers like ""Smiting"" (page 164) for ""Smiling"" (in the original, page 252).On the whole it appears that this edition (Ramble House / Fender Tucker) was printed from a defective e-text made from a fuzzy photocopy of the original edition. And since there are already a number of defective e-texts on line, it's hard to see why we need one in print."
5,Great movie,Won't give away the plot but was a great movie we'd seen many times and wanted our own copy. If you haven't seen it you're in for an enjoyable evening.
1,Piece of Junk,"We had this unit for all of three months before it sprung a leak in the back and soaked the carpet in our apartment. When we called customer service they told us that we had to have the original receipt from when we bought it in order to get any kind of customer service. I'm sorry, is that standard?? I have never had anyone ask me for the original receipt. I will definitely never buy one of these again."
1,VS developers: Stay FAR FAR away,"I rank this book among one of the worst computer books I have ever read. ... It is filled with redundant code, poor examples and plenty of bad jokes. This book was written for masochistic notepad coders who like command line compilers. For any Visual Studio developer looking for an excellent reference text, advice on proper coding strategies, and a book that is worth what you paid for it, stay FAR FAR away, as this book is none of the above and doesn't even acknowledge the existence of VS.NET."
5,Professional quality in every aspect,"I had a small unit that switched speaker on and off and the speaker wire kept popping out. I purchased the 6 station Niles to replace it. This unit has some physical weight, there is nothing tinny about it. The knobs and switches have a smooth yet positive feel. The attachments for the speaker wire are really the best part for me. You can remove the attachment blocks for each speaker, attach the wires (screw clamps) and then slide the blocks into the back of the unit. This is extremely helpful if your stereo is in a tight location as mine is. Also, the size of the wire openings is large enough to accommodate heavier gauge speaker wire. Finally, I am very happy being able to adjust the speaker volumes in different locations from the stereo. I have two sets outside and they have to be turned up higher, yet I don't want to blast out people inside."
4,Good clay play,"If you are looking for a clay product that makes very little mess, is wonderfully versatile, dries fairly quickly (overnight) and can be colored beautifully with watercolors or markers before it has even dried, then this product is it. I also find that the individual packs are the right size for small projects. Enough to do something with but not so much that they waste it. I have used it with kinders through sixth grade and it is great. I will be using it as a staple for clay work in my art classes in the future."
4,Great Buy,This soudtrack is no longer made and was able to find it in good condition at a great price on Amazon.
5,It is James Stewart what more can I say.....Wonderful,Anything with James Stewart is good. He is a great actor and would have no problem getting everything he is in. I love this and Mr Smith goes to Washington.
3,Atkins is no longer the best guide to the Atkins Diet,"Dr. Atkins diet in 2003. Although the Atkins diet continues to be popular (simply because it works and is healthy), there is a better book on how to do it and the associated science. This is TheNew Atkins for a New You: The Ultimate Diet for Shedding Weight and Feeling Great.(published 2012). While the diet described is very close to the original, there has been much good science done since Dr. Atkins passed away. The Westman, Phinnney, and Volek book includes this more recent science, while still describing how to do the Atkins Diet in a readable and understandable manner. Hence, it would be the better purchase."
4,fun read,"I really enjoyed this book. The ending was a bit abrupt, but up until then I was very engaged. I loved the opening hook. I stayed up until after midnight to finish this book the day I bought it."
3,very useful,"this is my first book for baby food, havent tried all recipes...however the few i tried are easy and tasty....my baby likes the new taste and i hope all recipes are equally interesting ..."
3,Gift for family member was underwhelming,Beautiful art; book cover not in such great shape as promised. Giving it because it also included a loose print.
4,Awesome Music,"Just an FYI to the person below me, it wasn't Gwen Stefani who walked down from the stage during the dance scene, it was the lead singer of Letters To Cleo, dimwit.I think the songs on this CD are great, although it IS missing the song that Stiles danced to on the table. I L.O.V.E. Sister Hazel. Awesome!"
2,It's not worth the price,"Ok, the package is gorgeous. But little else.The gem here are CD's 3 and four, BEAST OVER HAMMERSMITH. The sound, the performance, the set list (it's practically a ""Best Of"" their first three albums), everything is top notch. And this perfection is also a problem!! Why?Because, listening to how good this live set is, you will notice how weak, really, are all other live albums by Maiden. You'll notice how the drumming by Clive Burr was much more powerful, precise, loud and creative than that of Nicko. You'll notice how all the live albums with Janick Gers are crap.The B-Sides are interesting, but already own most of them. The first yeasrs recording are just a curiosity, unless you really feel pleasure by listening to ""Iron Maiden"" 5 times...."
5,Read the book! See the movie!!!,Great fun to read! Not your typical sci-fi shoot-em-up-evil-aliens encounter. Actually a whimsical coming-of-age story with an unusual twist.Interesting Trivia: Can of Worms was one of the first really successful movies made for and by the Disney Channel. Check out the cast members on IMDB.com to find some very high-wattage surprises!
1,Thomas L. Friedman he is NOT!,"I just finished this book. While reading it I found it a little disjunctive, a little disturbing. But it wasn't until I slept that I woke knowing what is wrong with it. Unlike Thomas Friedman, Mr. Horovitz doesn't mingle, as he admits, with Palestinians nor does he go into the West Bank or East Jerusalem, except occasionally as a journalist. That would be okay; what is not okay is the writer's quite unbelievable arrogance. He believes he might have saved Prime Minister Rabin from his horrid fate--if only he had been at the peace rally in Tel Aviv the night he was shot! He believes, or strongly suggests, that his wife single-handedly threw the last Israeli election--to Mr. Barak. Arrogance isn't interesting and neither is most of this book. An attitude lies beneath it that is faux macho and lacking artistic value."
5,"L'Oreal Natural Match Hair Color, 3N Natural Black","I like & using this hair color from years ,I do not get this from market but I am still getting it from Amazon. Because of some of my skin problems I can not use all other hair colors.I will recommend this color to my family & friends who have any skin problems."
5,Amazingly Painted Illustrations,"This book still engages my kids who can now read it for themselves, ages 6 and 7. We've been reading this at night for at least 3 years, not because we've had any fear of monsters. It may help that I'm an artist and can revel in the imagery and explain the magic that Dean Morrisey exhibits with his paintings. I want one! I love the imagination and the magic of the combined antique toys that make up the Monster Trap....we study it and find new things all the time. Each of my children has a special part that they always point out. This is a fabulous gift and that is how it got into our library. I think there will be a fight between my 2 kids when they become adults and go to claim this for their own library! Get your own!"
3,Good Book - Bad Shipping,"Have been trying to find this wonderful book for three years and finally purchased it, used, from Amazon. The book probably started its shipping route in good condition, but since it was packaged only in a flimsy envelope with no cardboard protection, it arrive smashed and bent almost in half. I am unable to open it and turn pages without creating more rips. Am I now stuck with this mess? Obviously, the shipper is at fault here. Please respond. Thank you."
1,not Merial product,Product was advertised as Merial fronline plus. Showed up as Armor frontline . Why didnt I just go to Walmart ? false advertising!
2,Worthless book,"I have found the book quite wealthy in its contents but the accompanying CD was a complete failure... most of the more ""complex"" examples had to be fixed in order to be readable by IE4.01 or NS4.05. I liked the editing but the author gave topics like JavaScript, and gave only several basic concepts of the scrippting language although there was code in which he used JavaScript code which couldn't be understood without additional resources. But practically it's a good reference for beginners or those who only want to know the basics. I would personally suggest, in order really to get somewhere go for ""HTML 4.0 unleashed Professional reference edition""."
2,"Big vocabulary, dry presentation","I'm an early childhood educator, always looking for products and activities to enhance development and communication. This one is not one of my favorites. Once a child is signing, this may be a good choice as it presents a larger vocabulary than most other signing videos. But the presentation is pretty straightforward, with most of the signs shown by an adult. Pretty boring for kids, I think. But maybe a good tool for parents to learn signs to share with their kids. The best of this genre is the ""My Baby Can Talk"" series."
5,Scoutmaster Praise,This book is well thought out and it has a wealth of knowledge. It can break you out of that same ole routine and get you thinking about other opportunities to challenge and lead young men.
2,"with poor pix, this is too much","I was astonished with poor quality of BW pictures this book contains. And I paid $50 for this? The photos are poorly lit so the details are not clear, and not sharp enough for this kind of printing. Texts are rather sketchy too. Intrestingly, resources contain a section for books on presentation models. I found most of them are out of print.I can just imagine this book's innitial run was so low that gave this hefty price tag to this book.Unless you have a lot of money to waste, or you're advanced, you'll be surprised like me."
4,"Good, but not great......","I thought the movie was pretty suspenseful and overall was good. The general plot that computers are taking over seems exceedingly used in the theaters and TV. But between the actors, special effects and storyline the film seems to keep you wanting to know whats next and interested. 4 stars"
2,the phone is good but service is ...,"The phone is o.k. It is really large compared to the newer Sprint PCS phones for example. Plus, nextel is horrible."
2,A great idea -- but disappointing results...,"I was so excited to buy this, thinking that I would never have to hand wash my bras again, which is such a pain! However, the Bra Baby comes easily undone in my dryer, thus defeating the purpose. I've even gone so far as to use safety pins to hold it closed, but it sometimes still comes undone. Even when it stays closed, the bra moves around inside, getting folded and causing the padding to get crushed. I've been reading reviews of the BraBall and it seems to be much better, so I'm thinking of investing in one of those... We'll see how that goes...Update: After having used the BraBall now for a number of months, I can say that it is far superior to the Bra Baby. Only problem with it is that it's slightly bigger and doesn't fit well in my small washer. But it's pretty easy to put it in open and close it inside and then it causes no problem. I would definitely recommend the BraBall over the Bra Baby."
4,Very accurate & couple nice features,"I wanted a simple monitor that was really accurate. The FS3 is a really good one. My favorite features are the large display and the ""buttonless"" function (holding the watch close to your chest rotates the mode of the display from heart rate to chrono to time of day).Two things I would change... I would show both the chrono and the heart rate at the same time (addressed somewhat by my ""likes""), and I would use a lighter grade plastic for the watch/wrist material. The plastic wrist band is SO thick, it's difficult to thread in/out of the buckle."
3,Very good but too short,"This dvd has all the fun characters for Shreks 1,2 and the third. My kids and I enjoyed watching it. We were so disappointed however on the length. It could have been at least an hour long. ONLY 22Min!!"
5,This show is terrfic!,This show is terrfic. At first when I read the reviews I wasn't sure to get it or not because of the reviews but I am so glad I didn't listen to them. This show is awesome. The whole issue of the quality of the dvds is highly overrated. It is not as bad as some people made it out to be. So don't worry and get Rhoda Season 1. I cannot wait for Season 2 to come out. I watched the first season so fast. I love the show and I am only in my mid 20's. Shows you great of a show this is. The problem is I wish Season 2 would come out sooner.
3,Positives and Negatives,"My thoughts:Positive:* This went with my my theme of reading novels written in poetry.* It reminded me of how I was in high school. I was kinda lost and floating through friends. Although, I never ran away.* It's much like a movie.Negative:* It's extremely sad with no real ending.* I think that she doesn't ever realize how much she was taken advantage of and that would have been a strong lesson to learn.* It can be a little bit too like a movie and not completely believable."
5,Perfect,"This is the perfect holster for my Beretta PX4 Storm Handgun. I have had the handgun for awhile, but did not have a holster. It fits snuggly, but with a little work the firearm comes in and out with ease, but does not fall out. Great product for any PX4 Storm owner."
5,Custard and Clamsause!,"I read books extensively. Occasionally I'm fortunate enough to come across a excellent piece of prose such as this book. Esoteric but enormously entertaining. The way it is structured constantly keeps you turning pages. Neal builds a ""Alice in Wonderlandish"" world where what you can expect is the unexpected. You get a chance (that you don't get in other novels) to visit a place you've never been before. In the case of this book...a very strange place indeed. The inside of Mr. Barrett's head must contain contain a amusement park for the eccentric."
5,Awesome,I love this artist. Have two of their CDs now and they are perfect for relaxation and massage.
5,Very Pleased!,Very quick shipping of the three filters. The filters are the most up to date MWF version of the filters just like you would find at Lowes or Home Depot for a much better price. I would definitely buy from this seller again.
4,Wonderful!,My four year old son went out to our garden to start planting seeds as soon as we finished reading it the first time. And the second time. He still likes reading it and so do I.
1,Blue Shift - not worth your money,"Half-Life: Blue Shift lets you play as the obese police officer Barney Calhoun.The first thing that will strike experienced HL players is the fact that BS is extremely short. Having only 20-odd levels, anyone with even a passing interest for first-person shooters will finish it in 3-4 hours. ( I have done it in 2)The game's brevity could be forgiven if it's content was of high quality, but once again, BS's levels and game content are nothing to rave about. Following the same principle that HL popularized of having small level clusters, BS's levels are not given a chance to show their full potential.Most of the levels seemed like a work of amateur designers.You are better off purchasing Counter-Strike and playing that instead of throwing your money away on Blue Shift."
3,Not sure,"I don't actually use these books myself, I get them for my customers in the computer shop. Have had good luck with the TYV Windows XP book. But I haven't sold any of these Vista ones yet, because I don't recommend Vista to my customers. So I don't know how good it is or not. So I'll give it an ""average"" rating for now."
3,"Hard to hold attention, but lots of detail","I am a fan of shark stories and history as well. I purchased this book despite the mixed reviews. I have to agree with the reviews. The author obviously wants to set the tone and atmosphere of 1916 New Jersey. But, I would've prefered about 75 less pages to read to get to the first shark attack. The author is rambling on and on about all these historic details. I think it is overkill. I would've liked to see some pictures too. But, I guess that is what our imaginations are for. In the author's defense, he worked hard to research these details. I commend him for that."
2,The Devil wore Prada.,A shallow treatment of shallow characters with shallow values... A waste of time.
2,Pieces won't stay together!,"We inherited this set from a cousin and ended up throwing it into the recycling bin because it was more frustrating than fun. Even on a hard, flat surface, the pieces would not stay together. Marble runs are great fun, but try another brand."
1,NOT another testament of Jesus Christ,Stick with the true Gospel of Jesus Christ: the New Testament. The book of Mormon is just a book written and sold by cultists. Remember the verse at the end of the book of Revelations? Anyone who adds to the Bible will have plagues added to him. Don't buy this book. The locations mentioned in this book have never even been found. Go buy a Bible instead of this trash.
5,THOUSANDS OF ROSES FOR EMMYLOU!,"Brave Emmylou made this album at a time when bluegrass was not fashionable at all. I never played it to friends but it's remained a firm favourite down the years. Her interpretations are just so right throughout, the selection is spot-on and the playing is superb. It's not easy to pick favourites, but the title track, Green Pastures, Darkest Hour, Jordan, Miss The Mississippi and Gold Watch & Chain are particularly appealing to me. Although I've discovered much beautiful new music now that bluegrass is in vogue again, I always return to this album as one collection exemplifying the absolute best of the genre."
5,Incredible,"I took this CD out of my library just today and decided I have to own it. I have never heard harmonies like this - they sound almost medieval; minor and major weave together in a musical tapestry that makes you want to weep. Listen to this as you read, ""Irish Hunger"" and you just may feel the presence of your celtic ancestors whispering in your ear."
1,Does the show absolutely no justice,"This movie did the original series no justice. It was almost depressing at how badly the movie butchered the original characters as well as the dark humor and depth of the show. The new Daisy was portrayed in almost a laughably bad way and I felt that the plot was stretched thin at best. It almost felt like a Lifetime movie of the week, cue: overly dramatic music and heavy handed direction."
3,Depends on your needs,"If you aren't very flexible (i.e. overweight or elderly) then this can be a god-send. But for the most part, I found I could do all the stretches just as effectively, if not more effectively, without it than I could with it."
3,comfortable but...,"It is quite comfortable to wear; however, much bulkier than my Sennheiser HDR-65. I was hoping for very clear, static-free reception, but from only 11 feet away it gives out a buzzing sound when I turn my head either to the right or left. On the other hand, I have walked around the corner into another room and still can hear the sound from the TV! Go figure! Weird. It buzzes every so often, and yes I have tried tuning it. Could it be interference from the Pioneer Pro plasma t.v.? Sound is clearer and warmer than the HDR-65. Overall, I think it is o.k. product."
4,Good story but UNNEEDED SENTENCES!!!!,"There are a few sentences in which Benson could have written better, for example: ""Fility habit."" Bond said to the unconsious man. It is obvious that Bond had been speaking to the man, who else could it be? It could be change to ""Bond shooked his head"" or simply ""Bond sighed"" Nevertheless, I still think the plot is good."
5,Now I Understand . . .,"Once you see this video, things you've wondered about President Obama's actions will start to fall into place. It is creatively superb. The filming and script are terrific. We saw it in the theater and now are buying the video because this is a part of history and we want to own a copy.The author/narrator is great, but we were particularly moved by hearing Obama's voice explaining his life and his motivation, i.e. what is ""in my genes"" at his father's gravesite. Two weeks ago we saw on the news a map showing all the countries where our embassies were under siege, and my husband pointed out that looked just like the map at the end of 2016 Obama's America. He was right. Just as the movie said and right there before our eyes.This video is worth its price and more.Quick and Healthy School Lunches (Moms Can!)"
3,Keep Your Wife Happy,"This is an inexpensive and decent perfume that will help keep your wife happy. Of course, there is nothing worse than a wife who bothers you all the time. They tend to complain about wanting more money and all that-- get to be a real pain. Buy yourself less annoyance."
5,Road House,"I love the movie but I do NOT like WIDE SCREEN. That is why I have taken it off of my wish list. Please add more of his movies that are NOT WIDE SCREEN, please."
4,"valuable text, dull read","One of the most fact-packed, intelligent studies of globalization, but this is noone's beach reading. I recommend reading the intro and thereafter using it as a reference.For a more literary, bizarre, and stimulating take on the contemporary global condition, check out Hardt and Negri's Empire."
5,Debt is Credit,"This is the 5th revision, the original was published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago in 1953. It was originally titled as, ""Debt-Jeckyl and Hyde."" It is interesting to note, on page 19 paragraph 4, about how the banks create New Money when a depositor's balance also rises when the depository institution extends credit-either by granting a loan to or buying securities from the depositor. In exchange for the note or security, the lending or investing institution credits the depositor's account or gives a check that can be deposited at yet another depository institution. In this case, no one else loses a deposit. The total of currency and checkable deposits-the money supply-is increased. New money has been brought into existence by expansion of depository institution credit. Such newly created funds are in addition to funds that all financial institutions provide in their operations as intermediaries between savers and users of savings."
1,I did not wantto see a musical!,"The video quality was good, but I hate musicals! I wish there was a better selection of these types of movies."
5,A modern-day tale of assimilation.,"Most of us Americans are at least a few generations removed from the difficulties of immigration. Frank McCourt reminds us that we are all essentially immigrants. All of our ancestors have endured similar taunts, jibes, feelings of insecurity and uncertainty in this dynamic culture. But Frank has endured it in recent years, and the way he tells his tale is what makes it so enjoyable. Don't start reading this book if you have things to do!"
4,"Good, basic tongs",These are pretty standard metal tongs. I've been doing more grilling lately and needed some that are reasonably priced. They work well.
2,Stopped working after 1.5 years.,"Was quite happy with the unit until it broke after only 1.5 years of use. Most people use the same monitor for multiple children, we'll be needing multiple monitors for one child."
2,A Dark Depressing book,"I have read other Denise Mina books including Garnethill and rather enjoyed some but this one is so bleak and depressing. I found that I really didn't care about the characters. All they did was drink, get drunk, take drugs, deal drugs, smoke and swear constntly. It's hard to believe people live like this.I gave it 2 stars only because Ms Mina is indeed a talented writer but her characters are unlikable."
3,"if you don't have it, don't waste your time but...","a must for everybody. Three days of peace and music coming to an end and what better way to close than with the legendary Jimi Hendrix? The first performance of the band of gypsies. You will love it from the moment Jimi is presented till the last chord of Hey Joe climaxing with the star spangled banner known to millions as one of the greatest day in the history of pop music. After you've heard it, you might want to see it but what the hell! I found out a few months later that the songs gpsy woman and mastermind performed by larry lee were cut, why? They may be pretty boring songs but they were part of the show, there's still plenty of space availble to put them in, why do you fool people like that?"
3,Dry...but fast.,"Don't get me wrong. Ottmar continues to do what he does best--play great flamenco-influenced music, lending his own personal take and a few other influences to the great tradition of the fast and furious guitar, but for some reason this album just doesn't do it for me. Too much studio fiddling, too little wild improvisation. Go for his live album Viva! long before you move on to this new release."
5,Deliciously Wicked!!!,"I won't go into plot descriptions of the episodes, especially since others have done it so well. I'll just say this is a wonderful series full of deliciously wicked characters who haven't a decent bone in their manipulative, malevolent, conniving bodies. I doubt that Rome actually functioned in the way this HBO melodrama suggests, but who cares! HBO took quite a chance producing this obviously expensive series, but it pays off. Great, great, geat!!! I'm sorry there won't be a series 3."
1,Goodkind continues his degredation of the series,"Wizards First Rule was one of the best books in the fantasy genre I have read and the subsequent books have done at best, kept my interest (2 and 3 were really good). God, I mean the main character seems to have become a more special and powerful person with every book. I did not mind the war wizard thing a while back, but the statue that made the entire city cry and revolt in the last book? Come on. This entire series just appears somewhat to cliche. This has just become a never ending tale of Richard vs. the big bad world (whomever the great evil at time seems to be).Goodkind's writing really seems to have come down to extending the series and not doing high quality work. Don't get me wrong, The Pillars of Creation isn't a bad book and I think it is worth reading if you have read all the others, but it leaves alot to be desired."
4,Nice Hats---But Be Warned,"I saw this book last week and just had to order it.I love the hats in this book. Most are variations of the top down method with a wrap cast on of 12 stitches. In fact, I learned the wrap method from this book, and I had never made a top down hat before.I also liked the photos and expecially the variations with other weights of yarn.I made two hats(Violet Seed and Valery)already, and I love how they turned out. However, there were minor mistakes in the patterns that I could get around. I also know of some errors in at least one other pattern--Bobbi.I have sent an e-mail to the publisher for an errata sheet.Even so, I would recommend this book. It's wonderful for last minute gifts and knitters with some experience should be able to get around the pattern errors."
2,The not so tempting history of spices,"Jack Turner's book has been showered with unusual advance praise ('a brilliant, original history of the spice trade'), but its content is of rather mixed quality. The Introduction alone contains numerous errors, beginning with a reference to cloves in Syria 3,700 years (briefly published 20 years ago, but never substantiated) and an incorrect description of a nutmeg (the author failed to notice that nutmeg is not 'surrounded' by the mace, but sits inside a shell). For all the hard work the author put into this, too often he falls for the spectacular and exaggerated in a 'sex-sells' history of spices. While it makes for entertaining reading, it cannot be relied on as a balanced or scholarly piece of work. In contrast, I would recommend Andrew Dalby's 'Dangerous Tastes - The history of spices' - maybe a trifle less thrilling, but written with far greater competence."
2,All Right But Not That Engaging,"I found a copy of this album cheap somewhere, and so picked it up on the strength of ""Amanda"", which I had always liked. That song remains the best song here - unfortunately, nothing quite matches it. ""Cantcha Say"" is pretty good - a catchy number, but the rest didn't make much impression on me. They all tend to sound alike, tend to sound like...well, like Boston (this album took SIX years to complete? ). It didn't help to have ""My Destination"" sound (presumably by design) sound just like ""Amanda"", either. If you're looking for a Boston purchase, most people will point you towards their first release, and I won't stand in their way."
2,the Hummer of diaper bags,"This bag is big, bulky, holds a lot, is heavy, and not terribly stylish. I used it for the first year with my first child but wouldn't use it again in the future. I NEVER used the attached changing pad, it just added bulk to the bag. If you are going on a long excursion where you won't have a car nearby for your backup stash of supplies and need everything but the kitchen sink, this is a decent bag. But if you are looking for a daily-use bag that will see you and baby through running a couple errands, I'd shop around for something trimmer."
2,why did i give this 2 stars?,"i own 3 espresso machines and my favorite is my jura z-5 perfect espressos every time, ok now this one, i have actually owned it longer, i have never gotten a good pull, its been very difficult to find the correct combination of grind and compaction, too fine a grind and it plugs the filter, too much compaction and the water wont flow through, but the real surprise is the sloppy grind mess, this alone should warrant a one star rating, no espresso machine should produce this mess that spills all over your counter. i have a ugly machine i bought at target for less money and you get a nice espresso with with a moist puck. i really dont understand these great reviews. why the 2 stars then? well it looks the way an espresso maker should look, i just wish it preformed as well as it looks."
5,OUTSTANDING!!!,"This... on HDTV... is just like in an IMAX! I'm an earth science teacher, and I can tell you this mesmerized the class. In fact, it's great for life science as well."
2,paint chips off,I loved this press at first but only lasted about two months before paint chipped....I was not happy. Poor quality
3,Not Great But Not Bad,"This book is definitely not Stephen King's best work (and may actually be among his worst)but it was okay. Not much of a story, but I love his style of writing."
4,I-tal returns!,"These Cleveland reggae masters return with some old, some new stuff. Wets your appetitite for a re-release of some of their other material. Dave Smeltz is Dub!"
5,Highly recommended for those who want to learn about how to pray.,"There has been no other book that has so profoundly impacted my prayer life other than the Bible as Remarkable Miracles by Guy Bevington. I first read it in 1975 and it revolutionized my prayer life. Guy Bevington discovered how to hear God in living color. Bevington learned that the greater part of prayer is in hearing what our Heavenly Father wants to say. I have given away dozens of this book to those who were hungering to know God in prayer.The testimony of Guy Bevington in Remarkable Miracles is proof that God is looking for a man, woman or child in and through whom He may show Himself strong."
4,"A great ""study guide"" for resolving marital issues",This book is designed to lead a group of married couples through some of the real-life issues faced in marriage. I found it to be well written and uses illustrations that any couple could relate to. We use it in a Church marriage class setting and it works very well.
2,So disappointed!!!,"I registered this item for my Baby Shower, but I ended up so disappointed because even though is compact (great on your countertop), reasonable price, and quick!, it's very hard to find the correct water measurement. You either get it too hot or too cold and you have to run cold/hot water under the sink for it to warm up or cool off. Who has time for that when you have a baby crying telling that he is hungry.This would have been a great product if the actual instructions would work. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS []!!!!Jan 24, 2003 - I am rewriting the review since i finally figured out the problem of being too hot and cold. This system works if you dont make the bottles ahead and put them in the refrigerator; in other words, make the bottle right then and there, so you cant have the bottles already prepared with the formula but it only takes 2 seconds to do, and if you have a hungry baby just prepare it a few minutes before you think he's going to start crying."
1,Really weird aftertaste,"I've made cornbread with this mix a few times now, and it comes out with a funky aftertaste every single time. It's so gross. I wouldn't buy this ever again. Just make your own mix. It's not hard at all."
4,Good Space Opera - great science topics,"Vital part of Anderson's future history (early on, before the empire that Dominic Flandry defended even existed), when Nick van Rijn's traders discovered a rogue world that was approaching a sun close enough to get warmed up. The notion of brown bodies was new in the 1960's when this was written, and the human battles over this freak of nature was as good as anything Anderson has ever written. His desciption of what was going on as the planet warmed up were great as well."
4,Good but not Great,"Cuckoo picks up exactly where Doppleganger and Pubic Fruit left off. It's good to see a band stay true to their roots but sometimes i wish Curve would just record their ""Loveless"" and make us all happy. There is some really good material on here. ""Men are From Mars"" and ""Superblaster"" are sonic blasts of guitar and techno. ""All of One"" and ""Left of Mother"" are a nice tender addition to the Curve sound. I love Toni Halliday's voice and admire Curve for being independent. But can't help feeling they're not reaching their potential with Cuckoo."
2,Seven Girlfriends for One Guy,"Okay,the title doesn't have the ring of ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.""Tim Daly plays Jesse,the Chef Who Can't Commit.As his character has problems with commitment,so does the director with the tone of the movie.Is it drama?Is it romantic comedy?Is it supposed to be funny?To complicate matters,there are dream sequences,such as when his ex-girlfriend who died in a car crash comes alive at her funeral.There's a love scene within an inflating hot-air balloon(???)There are incriminating photographs that fall from a ceiling,and eventually land in pudding&among; mourners.There's an endless drive with the insomniac heroine.There's even a scene when Jesse meets up with a lesbian ex-girlfriend.The hero's ""self-discovery"" isn't exactly convincing since the director doesn't seem to know what genre to use.This belongs in a cheesy film festival,not ranked with ""High Fidelity.""It doesn't take itself seriously;neither should you."
3,it is worth,"I have read a lot of poker books and I have acquired a good understanding of strategy in conjuction with other texts, especially from applied mathematics and gambling psychology. This book explains in depth the strategy, reading hands and even psychology in an enjoyable manner. But I think it still has no full coverage of odds calulus, interpretation and math behind the poker. I found Catalin Barboianu's ""Texas Hold'em Odds"" far superior on this count. I recommend it as a completion for this book."
3,Disgustingly impressive,"Or impressively disgusting, take your pick. After watching this movie you grow to despise Bill the butcher so much that its jarring to realize while watching Daniel Day Lewis in the bonus features that it really was all an act. Adding to the intense realism of the storytelling is the incredible movie set built in Rome's Cine Cita movie lot in only 5 months.Scorcese's storytelling is revolting but then you think this(or something close to it) really is part of American history. And as corrupt as politicians are now, as bleak as life today may seem, it's nowhere near as horrible as life in this NYC slum during the mid 19th century.It is a monumental cinematic achievement. Daniel Day Lewis gives an amazing performance. But the overall effect is just overwhelming in a bad way. The violence is over the top."
2,Not worth the time....,"I agree with the last reviewer about the book being a BIG Disappointment. I was expecting a lot more than what this book had to offer. The cell phone and toys were just too weird for my taste and were very unbelievable for me. I love romantic time-travel, but once you have read magical tales of the here and then, it's really hard to beat. I would suggest looking into Lynn Kurland or Karen Marie Moning if you really want to be transported back in time and a tale that will leave you wishing it were you."
4,Fantastic pans,"After quite some research and deliberation I decided upon these pans, mainly because hard anodised is the bext type of non-stick coating at the moment, and also because of the Anolon name. The pans are great. Good, solid construction, and heavy bases. They cook well.One thing to note is that as with all non-stick you must use plastic or wooden utensils in here.The one negative is that the pictures on the Amazon website shows the saute pan with this set. However, when I received it I noticed that it came with two frying pans. Looking back at the item description it does indeed say it comes with 8 inch and 10 inch french skillets (frying pans). So, the text (and contents) and photos do not match. Amazon should rectify this!"
5,The Fugitive DVD set,"I thoroughly enjoyed the DVDs. This is my all-time favorite TV series, and the DVDs were of very high quality."
4,replacement air filter,My husband was told about this filter so I bought him one for my car. It makes a little difference in gas mileage but the best thing you don't have to change it at all. So far we like it.
3,Different,"We were looking for a different kind of movie, not stupid or intense - - well, it's different.The story itself is ok, although it took a while to get into it because it starts off pretty heavy, comedy comes in many guises - but we stuck it out in hopes of it getting better.Helen Hunt is excellent, as usual. Bette Midler is excellent, as usual. Colin Firth is also excellent, as usual. Sorry, I'm not a Broderick fan - so am uncertain if it was his character or him.Confusion rules the movie, it's emotional without a lot of emotional displays - very reigned in, yet effective. It's a strong topic, delivered well - but no way would I call it a comedy. Yes there are a few chuckles, but it's not funny at all. Wrapping it up the message comes through so beautifully that it was worth sitting through, enjoyable and yet doubtful of repeating. Love is painful, it hurts, answers to prayers are not necessarily what you ask for."
4,strong arm is holding up quite nicely,Fairly easy to install took a few minutes. Recommend reading the directions first. Have a flathead ready. Thats all you need.
4,Town and Country,"Slim Aarons really knew how to capture the jet set of a certain era, his images are so well crafted and the lucky subjects are always shown in there best light, literally and figuratively. The best picture in an array of amazing photography, and one that perfectly captures this rarified air, is the iconic picture of CeZe Guest standing by her pool, it captures all you need to know good and bad, through the prism of a beautiful woman, in a beautiful setting without a seeming care in the world, the very definition of, ""To the Manor Born"". Mr. Aarons captures so perfectly a life of unapolegetic jet setting opulance, and whether he means to are not he also captures the shallowness of it all, and you wonder, with all of this, are these people really any happier than the rest of us?"
3,Well written but boring,"Maybe I was biased because I dislike fake engagement stories. Maybe I read this too close to Layton's very fine The Duke's Wager.Whatever the reasons, I did not like this book. Yes, it was well written. Yes, the heroine was swell and likable. Still, it did not work for me. There was too much narration, too much telling instead of showing. Also, the hero's actions from the beginning(above mentioned fake engagement) did not mesh with his charaterization. He did not know her and was, in fact a bit of a cad. The writer did not adequately explain North's about face.I kept telling myself to keep reading and that such a well written book was bound to get better. Some parts actually did. Some did not. But I really had to force myself to stick with it. Romance novels should not be endurance tests."
3,Good intro to XML -- XSL info is obsolete,"This is a very good introduction to XML. However, I bought the book because it was the only one I could find that covered XSL. Unfortunately, XSL seems to have changed completely since this book was published. After reading the book I looked at the spec and found a completely different syntax. IE5.0 supports the spec and not what is documented in this book."
4,Good Drama Movie,"I was reading Major Ed Dames book ""Tell Me What You See: Remote Viewing"" when he mentions this movie being made, interesting insights into RV."
4,Delicieux,"Being a Francophile of the highest order I devoured Susan Herrmann Loomis' book avariciously. She captures the joys and pitfalls of living and working in Normandy with charm, wit and delicious recipes. Susan - please write some more; as a writer Ms Loomis encapsulates all that I aspire to food and travel - is there more to life?"
1,"If you are older than 14, this magazine is NOT for you!","I have been a long time subscriber to Rolling Stone. For the longest time they actually talked about music (Like when MTV used to play music). Now it seems to be marketed toward the Teen Beat crowd. If you love the Jonas Brothers and Adam Lambert, this is your magazine. Occasionally they still have a good article or two. Expect lots of stories about Nick Lachey and that dork married to Britney Spears. Also be aware that Rolling Stone thinks that the Jonas Brothers are on par with the Beatles. The last 20 issues I read ALL had an article about the Jo-Bros.This once great magazine is now horrible!"
4,Beautiful poetry of a childhood,"I am an unabashed fan on Yoel Hoffman's books. This volume, however, is different - for the first time I felt on the outside looking in without comprehension. Why? I suspect it is because I am not Jewish and have never been to Israel. Hoffman has written a beautiful, poetic narrative of childhood. It is, perhaps, closer to prose poems than poetic prose. The images are multifaceted gems that are pleasurable to read. But the connotations that should have arisen from the references to Jewish writers, to children's songs, to Jewish festival prayers and hymns -- footnotes gave me minimal denotations. The rest was lost on me.I still recommend everything by Hoffman but suggest that you learn to love him from one of his earlier books before tackling The Shunra and the Schmetterling.Earlier works:The Christ of FishorBernhard"
1,Make sure you have the machine to play this!,"I haven't rated this game correctly because I cannot play it on my computer. I very recently (we're talking less than a month ago) bought the new iBook G4 laptop for $1,300 straight off the Apple website, and was excited to have this game coming to me. Well, as it turns out, the new iBooks don't have the right video card to play this. So...not sure whether to mail the game back to Amazon and get the regular Sims game or what. All I'm saying is, if you have an iBook like mine, beware."
4,An excellent RPG,"It is a good RPG, with rules covering every imaginable problem and is not limited to generic fantasy. It also encourages puzzle-solving over hack-and-slash, unlike AD&D. However, because of its many rules, it isn't very flexible. That took it down to 9, and the fact that Rifts looks better took it down another."
5,A wonderful look at religion and morals,I don't want to discuss much of the story so that I won't give it away. How ever not unlike most of her other books you will fall into her fantasy world full of vibrant images. I love the fact that Anne Rice has a way of showing us that we are all human. In this book even the priests are in bed with the devil as is the painter of heavenly images. When you return from the journey you will have a better understanding of humanity and our down falls.
5,Truth is a welcome thing.,"Wonderful movie. It's great to see movies like this that hopefully inform American citizens about the truth of the occupy movement. Sadly the networks and the media in general, as pointed out in the movie, ignore the facts. Breitbart is Here!"
5,Good Job,"The item arrived as promised. I was notified when item was shipped. I was kept informed as to all aspects of the sale as far as when they received the order, when the order was processed, when order was shipped and when I could expect the shipment. I would order from them again with no second thoughts. It is nice to place an order and have no problems what so ever. Good Job !!"
4,title,"was a great price, tried to order another and price all most doubled, so didnt need it that bad. But is a good product...."
5,"Great, once you learn how to grind your coffee...","The first few times I used these pods I got really weak coffee. The key to getting a good cup is grinding your coffee much finer than you would for a ""normal"" drip coffee machine. Once I figured that out it made great coffee and was much cheaper than buying pre-made pods."
5,Perfect for the New Generation of Kiss fans,"This ""Best Of"" is perfect for the new, younger generation of the KISS Army. Creating a greatest hits album for a band as monumental as KISS - that's been around more than a quarter of a century, with almost 20 studio albums out and various live and solo projects, the task is a daunting one.""Best Of"" has all of the essential classics. With Deuce, Shout it out Loud, Beth, Hard Luck Woman, Calling Dr. Love, and of course the original live version of Rock & Roll All Nite, this is a great beginner's guide to the world of KISS. Not only do you hardcore rock out while you're listening to the album, you're able to gain true respect for KISS by hearing just how influential they have been on today's music scene - song after song. Rock on!"
2,Missing a little Je ne sais quoi,"The plot got better over time, but in many places I found it to be lacking. It seems like the work of someone who hasn't quite figured out the intricacies of what detail needs to be included and what detail can be left out. He just didn't push far enough. There are some details that really didn't make a whole lot of sense either, such as how a main character with the particular set of experiences and attributes that James had could know and accomplish some of the things he did, even if he did read a lot of fantasy books.I'd say this makes for a mediocre book for middle school students. With some more practice perhaps Pratt could go somewhere, but this didn't really hit the mark.*Re-posted from goodreads.com"
2,Too implausible,"The story of an average family and their sensitive son had its eerie moments. The end was a major disappointment, which left me unable to tie up all the loose ends."
3,I have to agree with Michelle L. Phillips and L.J. Russell,"I'm also a great fan of Christine Feehan's work. I've read almost all of the Dark Series and I have to agree that the sex scenes... well... they just don't quite cut it. The plots seem to all be the same and the books have started running together for me... instead of leaving a lasting impression. I did enjoy this one because Colby was a farm girl like myself, but other then that it left me wanting more in the romance department. Maybe she needs to take a break on the Dark series for a while and try concentrating on her other series. There's 17 or 18 books in this series and no more then 5 or 6 in the Leopard, Ghostwalker, and Drake Sisters series. Maybe she's just burnt out on the Dark series for the time being?"
2,"Times change, but hope never does","This book was written in 1921. Read by my grandmother, mother, and now myself. My Grandmother gave me her copy. My mother always said how she would have loved having a lunch box with compartments like Elnora's. My grandparents were pioneers in Southern Alberta and times were tough and money sparce. School was not free and it was hard work getting there. This book shows us how to focus on what is important and what it takes to get there. Though Elnora is fictional, there were thousands of young women trying to get educated in that time period. Thank you Gene for a beautifully written story of triumph and love."
5,yum!,I got this for my folks and my mom can't say enough great things about it. I think they have panini sandwiches every day for lunch!
4,CD,Ordered for my husband for Christmas. He enjoyed and has watched several times. He has recommended the to several friends.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!,This DVD was a great disappointment! It was nothing more than a slide show of random karagiozi images with unrelated music playing in the background. I was under the impression that I was purchasing a series of different Karagiozi skits...not so at all :-( It was definitely not worth the $30.00. It is not even worth $5.
5,Not for the faint-hearted,"Sure, the length of the book at a first glance might be enough to scare you already. And it is complicated. But It is totally worth it. This is a book that needs commitment.So be prepared to devote almost all of your free time into this book. It immerses the reader and is a fascinating treat to the senses (especially for those with an imagination). Chillingly haunted, very wordy, this book is not famous for it's simplicity.But if you're not looking for simple, and you want a terrific scare, pick this up right away. Probably one of King's best."
4,"Worth ORDERing, if you like fun action movies","I'll keep it short. The Order is a very good light hearted summer type action movie. Don't expect too much from it and you should enjoy it. Just take it for what it is, not what its not. And it [stinks] that there are no special features except three trailers."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:George Sanders is good as usual and the movie works reasonably well (the ""brick wall"" motif at the end is quite effective), but there's just not a lot here--the movie feels padded even in its brief running length and not a whole lot happens."
3,Scarlet's BORING walk,"it grows on you. the more you listen, the more you'll find. tori is the best live performer out there. her latest tour was stunning."
4,decent bike rack,relatively easy to install but would be better if it came with straps or other bungie type cord for carrying items
3,Garmin - sensible & convenient,"It is easy to install and simple to operate. If you miss directions, it recalculates directions quickly. We noticed however that it does not always show the shortest routes. Also, the vocal directions do not indicate street names. Overall, it is a great equipment at a good price."
1,Back Booster 1001,"DO NOT BUY!!! These are so comfortable because they are adjustable. HOWEVER I bought two of them and both developed leaks, the first one within one month of use and the second within nine months."
3,Doesn't toast evenly.,"Like many other buyers, I can't get the toaster to toast evnely top to bottom and on both sides. Otherwise, it's a great toaster. Love the pop-up feature. I can get anything of any size out of the toaster."
2,Kinda' Confusing!!!,"In the beggining it is incredibly CONFUSING!!! It ""may"" get better with time and cooperation. I don't think anyone from 9-99 would ever be able to figure this game out. Although, the graphics are the best in any CD ROM I've ever seen. You can ride the rides, and see from peoples points of views. The ""! Guy"" that ""helps you"" is just AGGRIVATING!!!!!! He comes in weird outfits like Albert Einstein!!! I would strongly advise people not to buy it if you think it's going to be like the ""5 star Roller Coaster Tycoon""."
3,The Afterschool Special Version of HST,"I'm a journalist myself and a writer of many mediums, and I find the biggest weakness of this film is: the lame direction. On paper, the writing is good, but the whole thing looks and feels like the producers are trying to explain Hunter S. Thompson to your parents. It's the Afterschool Special version of Gonzo journalism and Hunter S. Thompson.Still, Bill Murray's performance is brilliant and worth seeing. He made a fantastic Hunter.Buy a version with the original soundtrack (I guess) if you're a fan of the exaggerated persona Hunter created. It's a fun way to live.-- Todd"
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The first time I saw the Nanny, I was hooked. It was the hilarious wit and sense of humor everyone on the show had that sparked my attention. Ever since I started watching the show 2 years ago, I watch it every night at 5 and 5:30. I can't get enough of the Nanny."
4,Good..Not exact route calculation..,"I bought this product after seeing the reviews. This product is providing route direction well in advance. So by the time you go exit/turn, it will tell you another route. It is not prodving exact route at exact time."
3,Novellete of an Infantry Platoon in Italy,"This small book covers a single day in the life of a platoon of war-weary American GIs as they hit a remote beach in Italy and try to accomplish their mission of taking a key farmhouse 6 miles inland from the beach. The difficulty arises when the platoon leader lieutenant and 3 top NCOs are immediately killed or knocked out of action. The leadership of the platoon falls on a lower ranking NCO who is not very sure of himself and never dreamed he would find himself in this position. He does an admirable job dodging strafing planes, a German armored car and fleeing Italian soldiers before attacking the farmhouse and trying to blow a crucial bridge."
5,"Fantastic Book, Fantastic Writer","I loved Michael Lewis' Moneyball, and per the suggestion of a friend I picked up The Blind Side. While Moneyball was excellent, The Blind Side may have just topped it.Michael Lewis has a gift for being able to tell a story in a way that explains the basics of an idea and makes it fascinating to learn about. Prior to reading this book, I would have classified myself as a casual NFL football fan; However, after reading Lewis' account of the evolution of the left tackle, it completely changed both the way I think about and watch the game.As if redefining the game of football wasn't enough, Lewis also has taken a character in Michael Oher and created one of the most interesting, unlikely, and moving stories I have read about. Oher's story gives a sense of hope that by being surrounded by special, caring people, there is no limit to what one can accomplish.A great book, easily one of the best I've read all year."
4,great for the price,I bought this table for my 3 year old twins and they love it I was able to put away some of there other toys and they play for hours on this table. It is thomas compatable although the smaller metal thomas trains do not fit on these tracks that was alittle dissapointing....Other than that its an EXCELLENT buy....
1,Pump didn't work,I've purchased this product for over 15 years & this is the first time the pump has failed to work. The cream itself should still be good but I can't get to it. I bought this awhile back and just now tried to use it so too late to ask for a refund/return. This shud not reflect on the seller so much.I just wish I'd bought it locally to make a return easier.
5,don't be affraid of one!,I bought this trimmer off Amazon for like 18 bucks. When I received it I was excited to use it. It doesnt pull hair at all! Its kinda scary because you think its gonna catch the inside of your nose but it didnt at all! It was quick and the added eye brow trimmers are great! I would however go to walmart and buy it for 13 bucks.
3,I can never face Snape again since I failed potions. . .he keeps making these cutting comments,"This game takes a LONG TIME, as you have to run across the castle constantly. Also this game forced me to fell a strong resentment for a one, Zacharias Smith, I can honestly say I hate that kid. The castle is oddly laid out as well, not really matching up to the books or movies. Spells are a lot of fun though so it is worth playing, though definitely not $50 worth playing. They also have these weird mini-game tournament everywhere, which I absolutely fail at."
1,This router version is FAULTY,"This is my first wireless router purchase and it is a piece of crap. The easy CD install didn't work. I spoke with 3 tech support people, spending almost 2 hours on phone plugging and unplugging the thing - and going over the same instructions from them to have the final supervisor apologize that v. 5 of this router has been known to have many problems and be faulty! My options were to return and buy v.4 instead or download some software from the internet that 'might help fix it'. I see recently I""m not the only one with such problems. So be very careful and DON""T purchase this version. I don't know what to try next, as I'm not a techie geek - Very unhappy!"
3,A Little disappointed,I definitely would not have bought this rug if I had been able to see it first..Not very good quality..It's not something that I will put in my living room.
5,A Difficult Subject,Henri Blocher takes on the most difficult topic in theology and philosophy. He is economical with words as he develops his arguments.
2,i dont know about zeece one,it was kind of cwayzeet but nut cwazeet enough for zee wikes of me. if you see awan teaw him i saw it
2,tiny bone,"dog went crazy as soon as she smelled the bone, and she absolutely enjoyed the flavor - however it was so tiny she could finish it in a single bite. i expected it to be much larger and was disappointed."
1,2 UNITS BOTH DEFECTIVE,"After receiving the first unit I charged it as indicated in the user manual. when i switched it on it started making strange noises and smoking, it smelled like it had some electrical problem. I returned the item. After receiving the replacement, I opened the box and put the unit to charge it didnt seem to be charging. I called customer service at Black & Decker and they said it was defective. I suspect that they have some issues with quality assurance."
1,Unable to Read,"I suspect you need to already be a fan of Robert Rankin to read this book.The blurbs for this book indicated it was funny and had nursery rhyme characters. I'll grant that there were nursery rhyme characters in the part I was able to read - the first 5 chapters. Funny, amusing - very subjective words. I was not amused.This book did not draw me in with characters or plot. The pacing was too slow. The ""amusing"" writing style was repetious, dull and heavy-handed. The dialogue? Silly but not funny.I was looking for something more along the lines of the Jasper Fforde books - silly, witty, fast-paced. Alas, it was not to be.After 5 chapters, I just can't go on."
1,These were not what I consider music,"I am an avid Country and Blues Fan. I wonder if anyone is still alive who enjoys this type of so called music. I found it irritating, not singing but screaming. Thank goodness for Todays Music"
3,Well written history with a fatal technical flaw,"Well written, easy to read full of information and some informative maps. But it has a fatal flaw. The author for some reason insists on using modern military and naval terms instead of the appropriate roman terminology. This has two fatal results. 1) The uninitiated reader can fail to understand the critical differences between roman and modern organization and operations 2) The experienced reader has an overwhelming sense of being talked down to. Though the author might be forgiven for wanting to make Roman History more accessible, the editor cannot be forgiven for allowing this horrible horrible misstep and badly misunderstanding their audience. Because honestly no reader with only a mild interest in Rome is going to pick up a book like this one. Unfortunately this makes the book unreadable. I can only use it as a reference to look up information but I am unable to pick it up and read it for more than 15min at a time."
2,Toro Leaf Blower Extension Hose - Use with Toro Leaf Collector,It sucked - no pun intended. I connected to the Toro 'leaf barrel' (also purchased at Amazon) but the hose weight kept causing the expandable Toro recepticle to fall over. Wasted time & money.
5,"Wonderful, colorful reference","I'm not an expert and only own a couple other books on wild herbs and plants, but I do know that many edible/medicinal books out there only have line drawings for the plants, which doesn't help my untrained eye at all. I NEED to see full color photographs of the plant, its leaves, flowers and fruit and different stages in the season in order to identify it. This book satisfies most of that need. The informative sections on each plant are concise and well-written.Another thing I like about the book is the size and binding. It renders the book just the right size to take it with me in my daypack, backpack or fanny pack. So I can have it where I need it: when hiking the Rockies, which is what it's meant for."
2,"Okay, but lacked anything memorable.","There is nothing bad about this movie. Unfortunately nothing bad does not mean that the movie is really good. There is nothing memorable about this movie. It's a feel good romance. A good choice to watch once with your wife when there's nothing good on TV. If you watch it a second time you'll notice all the plot holes and loose ends. It loses its luster.What would have really helped this movie along is a little more depth - perhaps additional character development of the little girl Annie who provides the warm humor, but too little of it - or maybe an extra 20 minutes tacked onto the end to resolve (at least partially) some of the dangling plot lines."
2,A Considerable Disappointment,"I understand that marketing strategy is key to the success of any book, but in interviews regarding his biography, Tim Willis has been misleading with respect to his purported ""interview "" with Syd. I think the intention was to build up suspense, saying that he had interviewed Syd, while In fact, it was no more than a doorstep encounter (borderline harassment) that is already all over the internet. Which brings me to another point : you may read a good 90% of this ""book"" on the internet as part, or all of, various Syd-related articles, I recognised the descriptions word for word, as I knew I was not reading it for the first time. Worse, Willis goes on to criticise other biographical efforts on Syd by name, it just didn't make me feel right. The rare photos, however, were good, notably courtesy of Lindsay Corner.Shine on for eternity, You Crazy Diamond"
1,The Program for Better Vision (audio CD),"Unfortunately, I cannot review this product because I never received it. Instead of the audio CD I ordered, the book of the same title was sent. I purchased the book several months ago. My efforts to contact Amazon.com were futile and the only recourse open to me was to get a replacement. I was charged $59.00 dollars for this product which is a greater price than the book. I want a refund, but Amazon.com will only allow a replacement, which I do not want or need. I am furious that I cannot speak with a customer service person and that no customer service e-mail address is available."
1,"a brilliant example in irony, a terrible guide to math","My wife, a former dancer who is now enrolled in college as an adult, was assigned this book in her Math class.The title seemed to indicate that was the perfect text for someone who had successfully avoided math in high school, but now, many years, later was confronted with reality.But much to our surprise this book only made things worse, much worse.I'm the math geek in the family, so I could appreciate the spirit in which the book was attempted. The author does try to make things transparent by discussing the fundamental principals/logic behind topics as Pi, the seemingly magic ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter.But the execution is a classic exercise in an ""expert"" talking over the head of the reader. Unwarranted assumptions abound. Multiple concepts are packed into single passages. The text must be painstakingly read and unpacked word for word.DANGER, Will Robinson, Danger!"
4,Adorable and loved!,"I bought this for my niece for Christmas, and she LOVED it! I paired it with a true-life book about a rescued snow leopard cub. She read the book and wouldn't let go of the leopard the whole weekend she was here. Very soft and lovable, and looks realistic. Time will tell on the durability."
2,He's not quite there yet...,"Apart from some reasonable songs (One Wish - Track 4, War is Over Track 8), I really didn't feel like this album was all there. To be honest I haven't really taken the time to listen to most of the tracks & in hindsight I wouldn't have bought this CD. His talent is clear but a little more tweaking at the studio may be warranted!"
1,"Idea isn't bad, but the execution stinks.","In competent hands this could have been a good book. Good Hollywood books make the top ten. These lousy authors can only dream about it.The authors claim they want to debunk the cult of celebrity. Instead they try to suggest they are superior to it in a moralistic and boring tone. Even worse, these two half-wits don't make a whole. They use old tabloid tattle as evidence then sneer and snarl. Dullsville.I got the idea they are trying to tout this book as the antidote to the cult of celebrity. Instead they are part of the problem, not part of the solution.This book is a waste of time and money."
2,unpleasant odor,"I couldn't clean my toilets often enough when I got Mrs. Meyer's rose & geranium cleaner.... it made the whole bathroom smell lovely. Now I see that it is just geranium..... but I still like it.HOWEVER, I bought lemon Verbena scented dish soap and I think it is horrible. It suds ok but the smell is weird. I have had Lemon Verbena hair products from another manufacturer and it is a delightful odor so I know it is not that I might not like that particular scent. Now I am afraid to try any other of your products!"
3,Lightweight Hobby Bench at best.,"I inspected an assembled H7721 at a garage sale in June 2010. It looks great, yet the negative comments have merit. You really need to know the level of clamping you plan to do. The side clamp is similar to one you may have used in your high school wood shop class. I would not pay over $275 for this bench."
3,Not Suitable for KINDLE!!,"Although the book's content is good and interesting, it is totally unsuitable for reading and studying on the Kindle.As it is all about charts, analyses, details, it is very (!) annoying not to be able to see or read the charts on the kindle approprietly. Also the browsing/moving forth and back between the charts and text is irritating.This is not the author's mistake but Amazon's.Amazon should warn its customers for this!I just bought the paper back version of the book, but now have double costs of course..."
1,CD Length,"This is music that touches the heart, but for those with healing practices that are accustomed to CD's of 50-60 minutes in length, you may want to know that this 'One' is a single song with 17 passages. Therefore the total amount of music is about 31 minutes. If you are like me and have an hour-based client practice, you may want to play it in 'repeat' mode."
5,Fantastic MMORPG,Ive played many MMORPG starting with Everquest but this game has without a doubt blown them all away in my opinion. Not only are the quest fun but dieing in the game itself is made a treat as you spawn as a ghost and can even do quest then. You can do both solo and play in groups with no problem all the way to the max level. The environments and character all are very colorful and enjoyable. For every part that Verant with Everquest has gotten wrong Blizzard has gotten right with World of Warcraft.
1,One Star For Ash,"This ""Twister"" knock-off doesn't really offer much as everyone's favorite ghoul-killer plays it straight, chases storms, and seeks a little romance. It is great to watch Campbell in something other than a supporting role, but this is a TV cheapie. On the plus side is a strong supporting cast that includes Ernie Hudson (as Campbell's mentor).The DVD image is full-screen and nothing to write home about. There are no extras.So, I guess this one is for people who love Ash, couldn't watch ""Twister"" because of some dislike for Helen Hunt, or just buy anything with a special effect. Now when will ""Atomic Twister"" get released?"
1,Why recommend this book? It's not worthy!,Why Oprah recommended this book is beyond me! This is not a book I liked reading. The main character is an over-sexed teen and later judgement is passed on the ex-Nazi woman he regularly bed down with. She reads in prison... so what! This doesn't make for an Oprah book...one that we should find exciting and well written....that's what I expect from the book club. You bombed here! I want a refund!
2,A fair picture of the depression/WWII generation,"Tom Brokaw's book is an evaluation of those he interviewed, much like the news he reports each night - detailed and personal. For those Marines who want a look at the same information, but just about the enlisted man of the Corps during that period, a comparable book is ""Gyrene"" written by Wilbur Jones, and published by White Mane Press."
3,The oldest American book on the Arabian Horse,"History in Brief of Leapord and Linden, sub-titled: General Grant's Arabian Stallions, Presented to Him by the Sultan of Turkey in 1879, by Randolph Huntington. This was the first book published (1885) in America to deal (almost) exclusively with the Arabian horse. Its author is universally recognized as one of the breed's foremost early authorities. Although its 66 pages contain only four illustrations and its style is rather antiquated, it is a true collector's item."
2,Worth a look.,"2 stars is misleading. I would recommend this to anyone interested in Becket. To see a directors interpretation of his work provided invaluable insights into both the works themselves, and the process of directing film.That being said, I was not amazed. The potential of a four disk DVD and large booklet, exclusively Becket, was unlimited. The product was a half-dozen enjoyable plays, and not even a documentary on Becket. In their great humility, they made a documentary, about themselves, making the DVD you are about to purchase. Great."
2,"Fun film, poor release.","This is a fun film and one of the few from the period where Jet just seems to have some fun and go off. But this is a pretty sorry release for it. So Tai Seng is releasing widescreen laser disc masters again? Niiicccee. Wait for a better release. At least that one might not have a Ric Meyers commentary on there. If there's a sure sign of a lack of care from a company releasing kung fu films, it's Meyers' name anywhere on the product."
5,Greatest Mug on Earth,"This is the third Stainless steel mug I purchased. I use ice in it sometimes and if I leave the mug on my desk I still have ice the next day. My husband and I fill our mugs with coffee before going to a football game and when the game is over, the coffee is still hot. It is the greatest. I gave this mug to my boss for Christmas. She loves it."
5,Exactly What I Was Looking For!,These tapes are great. John is very informative and direct. Explaining chakras and Angel/Guide differences can be confusing! His personal real life stories added in are fun too! John made it all very clear and it made sense too! I am naturally very hyper and it takes a good voice and an interesting speaker to keep me motivated and relaxed. John did it! Thanks John!
3,So You Want To Be Like Christ?,This book is great to read and use the workbook designed for it. It helps your walk.
1,What is a truth?,I do not believe Moore is telling the full truth about what really happening in Afghanistan during US war against Taliban. I am skeptical that he is telling us the truth. I understand the need to protect classified activities. But the most important thing is what is a truth?1. I do not care about how many soldiers are there.2. I do not care about how many people are live in Afghanistan.3. I do not care about oil.4. I do not care about what languages that Afghans speak.5. I do not care about US government's reasons for war in Afghanistan.6. I do not care how many wars have we learned from the lessons.7. I do not care what do you think about this book.8. One thing that I care is truth.Most people does not know what is truth. I know what is a truth. I can define truth. But I am not telling you what does truth mean. Most people does not know how to telling the truth.TRUTH IS THE MOST POWERFUL WEAPON.
3,A Lesser Sellers Effort,"An entertaining cops and robbers yarn, however, if you are looking for Peter Sellers in his full comic range don't look here. It appears that he is passing the time until ""Dr. Strangelove came his way. That said, Sellers fans who are familiar with his greater work will be entertained by this lesser endeavor."
1,Oops! We fell for the hype!,"My book club, usually an astute bunch, decided to read this book because it was on the bestseller list so long. Big mistake. It was available at our local bookstore only in hardback, so we paid nearly $20. for it--it was discounted a bit, and we like to support our local store on occasion. We felt like idiots--and you'd have to be an idiot to call this book ""amazing"" and ""life- changing."" The only life change I experienced was my wallet being $20. lighter. The author should be ashamed of himself, though I suppose he should be commended for coming up with a remarkable marketing ploy. I won't even put this book on my library shelf--and I certainly won't waste a bookplate on it. We will stick with books that inspire, teach, and motivate us from now on. That doesn't need changing!"
5,Cute!,"If you like the story, which of course you do. You'll love this film. Great voices and beautiful animation."
4,Inexpensive and effective,"This flat license plate shield is great... it covers my entire plate and paired w/ a Cruiser black frame it looks awesome.I gave it four stars because it's not as tinted as it looks in the picture, but I'm sure it's for legal purposes."
3,Interesting,"An interesting read but Mr. Deedat has proven nothing that has not already been said. Nothing will convince me that Muhamad is a true prophet or that the Koran is the final word of God..One needs only to look at the its contradictions and see the writings of that era. If we cant believe in the story of the Crucifiction, we cant believe in the fiction of the Koran."
5,Didn't use it.,i gave it five stars cause it is cheap considering you don't need to splice your factory wiring. But I didn't use it since I'm using signal cables for my setup.
1,Not what I expected... :-(,"If you want a toy that makes loud noises, this is the toy for you! If you want this toy to actually move and perform the tasks on the controller, forget it. I bought this toy for my 4 year old son. He loves the noise (very loud! ugh), but we can't get it to move (roll across the floor). It doesn't work on either hardwood floors, or on carpet. From the other reviews that I have read (after I bought), NOBODY can get this thing to roll on a floor (you'd think the maker would've tested it before marketing). Oh well, lesson learned. Hope this helps you in your decision."
3,THIS IS OKAY,"THIS MOVIE WAS INTERESTING.IT'S DIFFERENT.GORY.IN ONE SCENE-THE KILLER KILLS A COUPLE OF PEOPLE,AND HANGS THEM UP IH HIS ""HAUNTED HOUSE."" HE KILLS A COUPLE OF PEOPLE AND USES THEM AS MANNIQUINS IN HIS ""HAUNTED HOUSE."" THERE'S NOT TOO MUCH ELSE TO TELL.I WAS SURPRISED WHO THE KILLER WAS."
4,Ever wonder about basic training,"If you ever wondered if you could get through basic traing, watch this movie. Well done, well acted, and well produced movie. 75% of the reviews agree with my 4 star rating, the others...????I was 1 inch away from experiencing this, and I still don't know how well I would have fared.I'll keep this disc for a second look about a year from now."
1,silly,I would not recommend this movie. It is pretty bad - a bad weak story - unintelligent plot. If you have time to waste and want to see mindless action go for it.
1,Ramtha ate my brain,"Should have been a pop-up book so as not to confuse people with all those words strung together. Thinking for ourselves is dangerous, let's all hide under Ramtha's skirt and see if she says it's all right to come out.Cliff-Notes For the Retarded"
3,Good guitar but strings are hard to press for a beginner,"The guitar is pretty good but, as a beginner, I find the cords a bit too hard. Intermediate players also found the cords hard to press so they were lots a buzzes..."
5,read it and decide for yourself,"This book seems to have generated extremes of opinion. So, I thought I should add my view on it. I have read and enjoyed all Maupin's books. Yes, some are better than others, but in my opinion all are good. This book is a definite change in direction and that is not a bad thing.Fortunatley I read this book without reading any reviews and am so glad I did.I read it in a weekend, a real ""can't put it down at this part"" book. It is EXCELLENT- my opinion I know, but make up your own.Borrow it or buy it, but READ it and decide for yourself. Oh, and its going to be in the cinemas with Robin Williams too."
3,"Somewhat Funny Movie, Wife HATED it","It was somewhat funny but not as funny as I expected. As stated the wife HATED it and walked out early.They tried to combine the action adventure and the comedy as was done in the series and wound up with a little of neither. By far not the best.Rent, do not buy."
2,Terrible book,"This book has a nice beginning,but it gets nowhere,really.The writing is so sappy,and it gets way too cliche.It is actually a dull version of The Christmas Carol.The characters are one dimensional,and I don't really feel for Eddie.Okay we know he had a hard time at war,but why keep mulling over it?And his relationship with Mag was so unrealistic and trite.I am only 14 and I don't understand how adults could love this book.Let's face it,Mitch Albom's writing is amateur."
2,warmed-over cliches,"As some of the reviews below suggest (albeit approvingly), this is a one-sided rehash of the modern cliches about this era: the Christians retaking their land are evil and intolerant; the Muslims who violently seized these lands in the first place are noble and benificent. I look forward to reading Mr. Reston's forthcoming book on the bloody Muslim conquests of the Middle East, northern Africa, the Iberian Peninsula, Turkey and the Balkans, and their forcible conversion of millions throughout those lands, which were once predominantly Christian. That should be a ripping good read.I give it two stars because at least the prose is lively."
1,um.....,this cd is really good.... as a frisbee. nothing more. it does have some great aerodynamics though.
2,Game,Good Game I guess but not too entertaining depending on who you play it with. Will give it more trys in different groups of people.
2,"What it's got is OK, what it lacks is sorely missed.","Face it. You cannot have an overview of an entire genre of music written by a single author as opinionated as Smith. Apparently he believes that if he doesn't like something, it's not worth mentioning at all. Examples? The entire progressive rock output of a quite important contributor to the progressive rock movement: Italy. Not a word! Smith also feels that it's more important to talk about bands like Throbbing Gristle than mentioning bands like Van Der Graaf Generator and Gentle Giant. These are two of the most important groups of the genre behind the biggies (Yes, Crimson, Genesis). Smith oddly enough mentions bands influenced by these groups, but feels their influences are unworthy of mention. Rather than an overview of a genre, it's an overly opinionated guide to Bradley Smith's favorite bands and nothing more. I cannot recommend this book."
1,Unusable after three months,"After I'd used mine regularly but not constantly for about three months, it developed a high-pitched whine that hurt my ears and gave me a headache. It was also annoying that there was no light to remind me to turn the switch off and stop draining the battery, but that's probably typical of this kind of product. I like the size and shape of it, and the sound quality was adequate for my needs (listening to podcasts) but it just didn't last."
3,that voice!!!,"I never liked Richard Butler's vocals I think they are to raspy like he has a bad cold all the time or something. However I can not deny that this is a solid alternative rock album SISTER EUROPE and SUSANS STRANGE are actually alright. Maybe he is an aquired taste for me it was more so the rest of the bands playing I liked more, Butler came second. I will be fair and say its worth getting."
3,NOT TOO SCARY,"HALLOWEEN H20 IS NOT AS SCARY AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE. DON'T GETE WRONG IT IS A GGOD. JAMIE LEE CURTIS DIDN'T PLAY THE PART TOO GOOD, BUT LL COOL J DID GOOD. HE AINT' REALLY CUT OUT FOR THE ACTIN BUSINESS, BUT HE DID AIGHT."
5,one of the best sjngles ever.,the metamorphosis megamix on this cd rocks.what am i saying all the songs on this single rocks also .this is a must buy if your into cd singles.take my word friend.rock on.
3,Decent sunshade with room for improvement,"Pros: good size for most midsize sedans; clean minimalist appearanceCons: fabric is not very transparent: for a clear, reliable view of vehicles behind you, you will have to use your side-view mirrors; plastic anchors for vertical mounting behind rear headrests are clumsy and didn't fit either of my vehicles well."
3,Not one clever lyric,"I'm not at all surprised that this album has been such a huge hit - the beats and songs are way above average and, most rare for a rap album, it's solid all the way through. However, 50 is a garbage lyricist. His stuff rhymes, and his lines about street violence and wealth are notable for their veracity, but that's really about it. There are no quotable bursts of wordplay on the entire CD. 50 should take some of his millions and slide some Llyod Banks's way in exchange for his rhyme book."
5,possible nov 18th release,not entirely sure as the IE website has not been updated in forever and a day but multiple stores have this set as nov 18th date and the Limited Edition for jan 13thmy hope is nov 18th but i allready have the single on the way
1,On the Fringe Interviews,"The majority of interviews in this book border on the bizarre. Interviews with and ""tips"" on dating from a professional dominatrix are laughable. The interviews provide no insights in learning how a man can really experience a woman. The chapter titles reveal nothing about the content as interviews from ""The girls next door"" could and are copied into ""Romance and dating"". If S&M, Bestiality and ""brown showers"" are your ideas of a fun date then this could be your book, otherwise it's a waste of your time and money!"
5,A must for Beefheart fanatics.,"This box set is BOOTLEG QUALITY, but the music and liner notes are FIRST RATE. The video footage is priceless! This package was made with tender loving care by Beefheart fanatics, and it shows. If you love Beefheart, grab it before it goes out of print! The instrumental ""Trout Mask"" rehearsals are worth the price of admission alone....burn them to a CD-R (without the in-between song banter) and you're in Trout Mask Heaven!"
2,Ramona Quimby IS a Pest,"Ramona the Pest is simply about a 5-year-old kid being a pest, right? Well, it's more than that. The author does take us into the mind of a kindergartener, but Beezus (the oldest sister) has a reason for calling Ramona a pest. She is! First of all, Ramona is spoiled and thinks that everyone's against her, and anytime she wants something, she knows--if she cries--her mother will listen to her. Ramona Quimby is a brat and I'm glad to see she's grown-up, because Ramona Quimby is nothing but a whiner and spoiled brat! Consider this before handing it to your child. I'm 13...I know these things. My little sister agrees with me.(Remember, this is just an opinion)"
5,Great Customer Service,We purchased this in March. A month later we had not received the caterpillars. One email to customer service resolved this. They indicated that the first shipment must have been lost in the mail and they promptly sent a second set (no additional charge). Our 4 year old is extremely happy! I will definitely purchase additional products from Insect Lore.
2,Temp Ring,"Product was OK, but doesn't do what I hoped it would. Too hard to read and to monitor finger temperature on a continuous basis."
2,Rips too easily,"We purchased this set because we wanted to get the matching sheets (thought they were adorable). However, when we went to put them on over the matress pad, the sheet tore on the end. The sheet is made too small (or tight fitting) to use with the mattress pad. We tried to get it on our mattress without the padding, but it barely fit. The rest of this set is great, but the sheets are poorly made."
1,Phew,"One hardly knows whether laugh or weep. This ""thing"" is so terrible on every level that I can hardly formulate a comment. But I'll try. Horrible script, horrible casting, horrible direction, horrible production, shall I go on? Arnold looks like a vain 70 year old lady...thanks for going in to the political arena where people appreciate tasteless behavior, the fakery and falseness of material infused semi-conscious self indulgence and prositutionary greed based decision making....Robert D......shame on you! Any of you who think this awful ""product"" has any redeeming qualities whatsoever, should drop their remote and seek help before it's too late. Thanks for your indulgence."
5,Buddy still rocks!,"A blast from my past! (Actually from my dad's past, since the copy I read as a little girl was from his childhood). I loved rereading this book 40 some years after I last read it. Okay ... so it's a little goody goody for the current time, but it features a lovable character, a childhood we can all feel nostalgic about, and a plot that moves along. I realize it was written for children, but I enjoyed it nevertheless."
1,Slow,"Plan on getting in the shower 15 minutes earlier than before. I have to stick each stem of my body under the water sprinkles to get them wet and saturation takes a couple of minutes. It probably takes about 13 seconds to get my hair wet through; I have short hair. That may not sound like a long time, but count thirteen seconds off and see if that seems normal; keep in mind, it is only your hair receiving any water at this moment. And to rinse out soap takes longer. If you don't mind being damp in the shower, go ahead and get this, but if you want to actually get wet, don't."
4,Great Book,I am very pleased with the books and have used them for several projects and have more I will do.
3,Not as good as the original German ones,"While the price is good and service is good as usual with Amazon, the best quality real Haribo gummies are all German. I hope Amazon brings the real ones here even if they charge more for it."
3,Dietary Supplement partial results.,This product has had a beneficial reaction on the state of my nails but I have seen no positive effect on the thinning state of my hair.
1,Bizarrely awful,Jumps all over the screen randomly. Both my Vista computers stopped recognizing it when plugged in as USB after a Vista update.
1,Where is Chris Claremont,I can't beleive this was at all based on the comic. Where do I even begin? This movie has taken all of the good elements out of the comic and replaced it with utter crap.As far as the casting goes Wolverine probably got the best treatment. Jean and Cyclops were also good though they did not get the screen time they deserved. Who in the world came up with Halle Berry as Storm? She can't act her way out of a paper bag. Not to mention the bad accent. If she could not keep it all the way through she should not have done it. Anna Paquin was also a horrible idea. What happened to the southern accent that Rouge was famous for?A lot of this can be blamed on the writing. Rouge has no history with Mystique and Wolverine has no history with Sabertooth. Even worse than that is the relationship with Rouge and Iceman. Iceman and Rouge were not even at the mansion at the same time. But all of these gripes aside this movie still sucked. I have to wonder if Chris Claremont had any say.
4,"Good light workout for advanced excercisers, Great workout for beginners","I bought this machine for my husband, who hates cardio. He's probably done it once a week since I bought it 4 weeks ago. That's more cardio than he's done in 2 years, so I consider it a success. I'm in fairly good shape, so I have a hard time getting my heart rate up on this machine. It's equivalent to a brisk walk. I like it, though - sometimes after a rough day at work all I can do is a light workout (and I certainly can't walk in the wintertime in Ohio). The biggest bonus is that you can watch tv while you do it.I also get a great stretch in my leg muscles, and I find that I can make the arm workout quite challenging. However, I think the calorie counter is way off. It may be correct for someone who is 250 lbs, but I don't feel like I'm burning as many calories as it claims."
3,May be a trip hazard,These look good but are somewhat thin and wear out after a year or so. I had to buy double-sided carpet tape to secure them to the wood stairs. I needed them so the dogs could go up and down. I have since removed them after they wore out. The other negative is that you can possibly trip over the edge if not secured down well.
1,a dissapointment,i have been playing dungeons and dragons since 1994 and i love it. i started playing 2nd edition in '95 and loved that even more. it brings out your imagination and 2nd edition is everythig a good RPG should be. however 3rd edition COMPLETELY strays from tradidton and flops around all the rules. it has been dumbed down and hyped up as pure money maker and no longer carries the traditions started in the original game.
2,"Terrific, sick, funny... BUT VERY ""BUGGY""--- BEWARE!!","I'd love to love this game. I've been a computer nerd for nearly twenty-five years and ""politically incorrect"" pc games take the edge off the day when I get home from the nine-to-five. My present pc is no slouch vis. power/memory/graphics, but installing ""Postal2"" and keeping the game from crashing is a nightmare...I've followed the instructions on the official website, downloaded the patch, downloaded ""DirectX 9"", re-installed numerous times, ran the game in ""safe mode"", submitted bug reports...The result???A beautifully twisted vision of a potentially GREAT game which because of the ""bugs"" is ultimately aggravating and *NOT* worth the $$$.Unless you have tomorrow's top of the line gaming machine with *all* the bells and whistles, my advice is to wait until they can work the bugs out or it comes way down in price."
4,Anointed,"I really enjoyed this album it has its own flavor even though Sara and Kim came out around the same time I feal that Sara reaches a diffrent audience. She has more of a hip hop feal, wich everyone can't get it to, but I know God will bless."
2,Not what we remembered.,I suppose it's been too long since we watched this series on TV. Some if it is very funny. Much is just bad taste.
2,Son liked....Mom not thrilled,"My 10 yr old enjoyed playing with this for about 2 months or so (kids!) 'Hot Wheels' usually make good products, but I wasn't very impressed with this item's durability."
5,The BEST thing that EVER happened to me!,"This game changed my life for the better! This is evidence of video games being a positive influence! It has been a dream of mine for some time to be a race car driver and this stroke of genius, has allowed me to feel as though i am living my dream! Right now the only thing that would complete my life is to meet the individual who created this masterpiece. I am a very avid gamer and I do not doubt that he is a fasinating human being, an artist if you will!! I, Kristen ... may never be a ""real"" race car driver but, because of 4 Wheel Thunder i sure feel like i'm behind the wheel! Thanks 4 Wheel Thunder, you've made me a VERY happy woman! EVERYTHING about this game rules! I truly don't know where i would be without this game!"
1,What a Rip Off,"This binder had 200 double spaced, single sided, huge printing pages for $145.Total rip off"
4,Perfect for teething!,"I dont use these for food since I don't have a dishwasher its hard to get them clean. However I do use them all the time for ice cubes during teething. Or for frozen pedialyte when little ones are sick! They work great! Kiddos can chew away on them, soothing and tasty!"
1,Not for developers.,This reads like an ADO.NET user manual where all possibilities are mentioned but lack reasoning and coherence in the subject. Its not an easy read and was not written for develoipers who needs to quickly get to the topic instead its more for trainers.
3,Good workout video but DVD freezes and stops working.,I like the workout video. The problem is that after only a few times playing it's freezing and stops playing.
2,Lower Quality,"These shoes are good looking; but, are of a lower quality that the Aididas and Otomix martial arts sneakers. Very little arch support and the seams are not welded at high quality."
4,Great for the money,"Great for the money, bought the CA-3000 speakers for $15 Canadian. I hook them up to a portable DVD player & they greatly improve the sound. No problems with humming or buzzing unless they are hooked up in the input jack instead of the headphone jack. If in the wrong jack, then the one speaker will just buzz.Only concern from reading the papers inside is that it says these speakers are not magnetically shielded. Aren't you supposed to keep magnets away from electronic equipment?? Even the el-cheapo CA-2012's ($9) say they are magnetically shielded."
1,movie with no point,This was the worst Adam Sandler movie ever. It was stupid and has absolutely no point.
2,Not so Bad for ...,"I have rented and played this game and it is trying to copy HydroThunder and is not doing a good job at it. The graphics might get 2 1/2 stars. The Good Things: Available at ... The Bad Things: Bad graphics/horrible boat selection and handling/ and VERY narrow courses that make playing difficult. All in all, if you are gonna pay ... for a video game, dont bother with this one."
1,boo,"i didnt think it was even that funny. i had something to say about every ""funny-part"". some parts were all right but i believe the movie should have never been created. And that goes for the sequel. I wish i didn't waste my time watching it."
3,"They fell off Big Tyme, but it was awight.","They fell off big tyme with this album. If the Hot Boy$ & Mack 10 was on here, it will be *****stars, since they ain't on here, they messed up! I like some of the new people like:Mikkey, Christina she shoulda been on here, she can't spit on the mic, I also like Lac & Stone. But this album was awight, but not better than none of other albums in Cash Money. If Cash Money keep making joints like this, they gone end up like No Limit. Cash Money still is fly, and my favorite record label. I hope everybody still together, and go back to their old hot boy style."
1,Django Where?,"This documentary had zero footage of Django performing. Lots of filler graphics not needed and was long and dull.Audio was good and it was informative,just could have been way shorter way better and GET some licensing for video footage instead of spinning and flashing the same photo's. Not recommended."
3,Great for carpet but not for bare floors.,"Love this vacuum for carpet only. Do not like it for bare floors. When sweeping our kitchen/dining area which is ceramic tile, I can feel the dirt being thrown back at my legs. I can also see the dog hair blowing out the back of the vacuum base. I have the vacuum set on the ""bare floor, low cleaning"" position, all filters are clean, the dirt cup is empty and there are no clogs. I think the problem is that the rotating brush does not stop rotating. On my old vacuum, the rotating brush did not spin on the bare floor setting. I've gone back to the old fashion corn broom and dust pan for my kitchen."
4,Includes some plastic,"My kids (ages 2 to 5) all LOVE this toy. I like it because it's open-ended play and can be put into various configurations. It is a little delicate when it's set up. If the kids get a little rambunctious, the thing either comes tumbling down or gets thrown out of whack so that we have marbles going every which way. This hasn't happened often, though, and my 5-year-old son is already trying to plan new configurations and perusing extension sets.My only real complaint with the Quadrilla is that I was under the impression that the set was completely constructed of wood. There are plastic rings and other bitty parts used among the wood, however, so be please be aware of this if you do not allow plastic into your home!"
1,Broke within 6 months and can't figure out how to get replaced,Bought this item back in March of 2005 and it just stopped working in September of 2005 after only minor use (2x a week maybe).I would like to find out how to get this P.O.S. replaced on the warranty but I can't seem to find a contact to make it happen.Do yourself a favor and note the several reviews in here that forewarn you to look elsewhere for another coffeemaker.
4,This is a fine product,"This product is pretty good for the price. I use it as a secondary unit to track the time and miles I put on my trainer. It has worked fine so far. You need to keep in mind that the rage of the unit is limited. you cannot mount the device on the handle bars and the sensor to the back wheel. That distance is too large for it to sense. I placed the unit between the handle bars and the seat. It works fine there. I usually take it off when I go out to ride. It has a lot of functions too, which I ofcourse do not use."
5,BOB'S BEST,"I have always liked Bob, I have been a fan of his since his day's with the great Muddy Waters. This is his second solo album, It has an all-star line up of old members of Muddy's band's. Including : Jimmy Rogers, Kim Wilson, Pinetop Perkins, Willie ""Big Eyes"" Smith & Calvin ""Fuzz"" Jones, all that is missing is Muddy himself. That is where Bob picks up he plays slide like a mad man, they say his seven years with Muddy he learned more than any one else about Muddy's style. This is Chicago blues at it's best, Bob's vocals fit right in. The songs and players are superb, this is very hard to find on cd. It came out in 1990 on cd, so it was an excellent find for me. It also is a long player, I have all of Bob's cd's this is the best so far, I also think (Up & In) is great, both worth a listen."
1,Waste of time!!,Comparing this book to Jean's Auel's Clan of the Cave Bear is an insult. The gruesome details of the people of Ka's brutality and hatred were a real turn off. It's also hard to believe Eena and Agon's 3 year old son could be so consumed with hate for his father that he vows to kill him. And all those similar names! I lost track of who the characters were. I forced myself to finish the book because I kept thinking it might get better. I was wrong.
4,fills in gaps between series and movie,"I'm not a fan of graphic novels or comics, so I can't really judge this as an example of that sort of art form, but I was glad to have the extra story filled in between the series and the movie. To me, definitely worth having for that reason alone."
2,decent but price has gone up!,"ok bedding,although very inconsistnet and the bag always arrives broken or torn inside a huge box. also why has the price gone up?? it used to be $21.99 now $27.98?? will not buy again unless price drops"
5,Comfortable,This by far my son says is the most comfortable sandal ever and has had several pairs for about 2 years now and when these wear out we will be getting some more.
5,ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!!,"This movie is by far the best all time comic movie ever. Heath Ledger (God Bless You, 1979-2008) as the Joker was questionable at first, but once I saw the opening negotiation scene with the mobsters, I was hands down convinced that this was the man for the job, ""Wanna see a magic trick?"". This movie, unlike many other reboots, didn't bore you. In fact, it kept you urning for more. Both Christian Bale and Heath Ledger put on a performance that was exceptional. I hope they reconsider another reboot because Christian Bale as the Dark Knight was perfect. As a fan, I gonna miss Heath Ledger playing the Joker, but I would hate it more if they reboot the whole franchise and try to one up the Joker character with a new actor."
3,Sound is not the best,"I liked the looks of this product and it appeared to be durable. However the wood is strung on elastic bands. It has held up to this point but I assumed it would be more rigid. My daughter, who this was a gift for, does play on it but seems to enjoy the metal variety better."
5,The most comprehensive book on the process of enlightenment,"I have read all of the books written by Kryon and Lee Carroll and have found that this one book summarizes everything I have ever read on the topics of spiritual growth and enlightenment. It is a book I give freely to people who cross my path because I think it offers the purest message on God and the meaning of life on this planet. Kryon goes, step-by-step, through the process we all need to take to find our true sense of Joy on this planet. It is though-provoking, funny, and incredibly uplifting. It shows that everything we do, that everything we experience has value in the eyes of God and the Universe. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is seeking to find their own sense of the Truth."
3,Before You Buy . . . .,"I wish some reviews of this album had appeared here before I bought the CD. I probably would have chosen something else.This is solo piano. The arrangements are different from the run-of-the-mill sacred choices currently available, and are quite interesting. So far, so good.The pianist is competent. But the engineering of the recording . . . oh dear! I think there was one microphone somewhere in the room, possibly too near the pedals. Some very odd effects were achieved, either by oddball pedaling, poor recording, or a combination of both. In short, a very low budget recording session has spoiled what could have been a worthy contribution to the needed diversity in the sacred repertoire.If you are purchasing the album because you want to hear the arrangements, and might be thinking of performing them, this CD might be of some interest to you. But for general listening, I'd get something else."
5,The Very Best of Harlan...,"Troublemakers is the best introduction to the stories of Harlan Ellison in print. Out of the roughly 2,000 stories he has written, some of his greatest are here, including Soldier, Jeffty is Five, and ""Repent, Harlequin!"" Said the Ticktockman. Each story comes with a little preface by the author, wherein he loosely ties them all together with the theme of ""troublemaking."" (In actuality, this is a ""greatest hits"" collection.) However, this by no means contains ALL of his greatest hits. For instance, The Whimper of Whipped Dogs is absent, as is Demon with a Glass Hand. For something along those lines you'd need to purchase The Essential Ellison - and only Harlan could get away with calling a book the size of the Norton Anthology ""essential."" However, to begin a study of his work, this is the place to start."
3,"A little vague, but kind of funny.","I saw this movie for the first time some 6 years ago on BET Starz network channel. I thought the movie was somewhat vague, but it kind of had me rolling a little. It was real funny seeing a black man take over a network and employ a bunch of people of color to run it. Antonio Fargas was out of his hookup as he is in some of his other roles as an actor. If you're the type who's really into black films, then it's worth getting. If not, keep your dollars in your pocket."
2,I don't like it,"I went to Amazon to read reviews for over 20 headphones with a mic. I bought this one in Fry's electronic today, and I am definitely going to return it today.It is very uncomfortable. The headphones sit ON your ears not around. This results is a painful experience. The headphones are also very warm, and your ears will be sweating a few seconds later. Finally, the mic is a bit far from your mouth, and I could barely hear my own voice. Even the mic of the laptop seem to capture my voice better."
1,biased view of American History is a NO NO,Save the biased view of American History. I wanted an unbiased view of American History .....FACTS and FACTS. Don't teach lies to children or your biased view........just facts is needed.
4,enjoyable,"There are many movies out there that wind up as extremely disappointing adaptations of the books they come from, but this particular movie is a rather faithful version of the book. Of course, it's not 100 percent the same as the book, but no movie ever is,. The acting is great, I especially liked Javert's actor. If you liked the book, then you should enjoy this movie. The acting and props are great, and the script is fairly faithful to the book (at least, as far as movie adaptations go) Enjoy!"
2,if u got an e-trigger dont buy,"this loader is useless if u got an e-trigger, it dont feed fast enough ur gonna keap breaking ball, shooting blanks, and ur gun is just goin to jam up."
4,information,"When selecting these products from a page and the page gives you an option to see a larger picture, it would help if that picture gave you a better insite to what the product is capable of doing. I like the lable factory but it is not very easy to navagiate."
3,Arthur Miller is a masterful writer,"I first read this play in high school and was struck by the limited vision and narrow thinking of the characters. With a few wonderful exceptions, these are not people you really want to know. Many moons later I've re-read it and found it as interesting a character study as ever.When in high school in the 60's, we weren't told about Arthur Miller's disguising of the Mcarthy ""witch"" hunts in this play. Much like the T.V. show ""M.A.S.H."" was really about Vietnam, this is about another embarassing time in American history. Although well veiled, it's really does point out the extremes those driven by their own delusional dogma will go to to be considered ""right"" and righteous."
3,started with this book but have found better aproaches,"I trained my first dog using this book and another by the Monks of New Skete. Six years later, as I began training my second dog, I re-read the books and became uncomfortable with the degree of force recommended. So I looked farther afield and found other approaches that are kinder and better suited to how I want to work with my best friends. I recommend reading ""Bones would rain from the sky"" by Susanne Clothier before selecting a training approach."
4,The Universe,"If you love space then this is the book for you. The conceps leave you wondering how big the universe is and if it is still expanding. The pictures are absolutly breathtaking. With the pictures and explanations of the galaxy, black holes, and stars, the book is a must for space lovers. It is easy to understand and would make a great gift to any child, or anyone of any age, who loves space."
4,wii Nunchuk controller,Purchased this as a christmas gift for my son he wanted an extra one for when his friends came over to play. Tried it out when arrived worked fine. The item arrived at a reasonable amount of time.
1,A non-edited scan?,This kindle edition has so many typos and errors where parts of the text are misplaced that if has the feel of a totally unedited scan. I do not believe that it has been proofed at all.If it had been one of the free books available I would have forgiven these many errors but there is no way that I should have been charged for it!
3,Uncomfortably enjoyable,"Let me first say that I love Elmore Leonard on principle. I enjoy the pacing and the humanization of his characters, regardless of where they fall in the moral spectrum. That said, I was intrigued by the plot involving the genocidal activity in Rwanda. Leonard was careful to keep the genocidal activity comedy free, although you couldn't help but feel undomfortable from page one through the end. It is a well crafted book, with several engrossing passages, and the typical Elmore Leonard dialogue, rife with witticisms, but the utterly depressing backdrop is a bit much to deal with. Read with caution"
2,Lord...,"The writing style in this book was so tedious to read, i had to give up 4 chapters in. If you like reading random thoughts jotted down all ou of order, this is the book for you..."
1,Don't Bother,"Don't bother ordering this item because you will be sorely disappointed. I ordered this link and my card was promptly charged, but the link that was sent instead was an ""angel"" link that was completely different and only priced at half what I had been charged. Pugster does not answer the customer service line during their posted hours, and when they do choose to respond to emails do not want to address the error of having sent the wrong item. Pugster finally decided to respond and send a replacement only after I had to have Amazon intervene for a refund, and the replacement link was STILL wrong!!! I now have 2 poorly designed angel links and no music note link. Unbelievably poor service. Product received is not even close to what is represented in the picture - not even music related in any way. Company refuses to admit that there is an obvious error in their warehouse. Definitely not worth the time or hassle of ordering."
1,the worst possible message for a child,"The gist of the book is that Rainbow fish is a beautiful and unique fish. The only way he is able to be happy is by giving away the thing that makes him a beautiful and unique individual. To make himself like all the other fish. Otherwise, no other fish will want to be friends with him.I'm guessing/hoping that Pfister's intention in writing this horrible piece of self esteem destroying garbage was to encourage sharing. It doesn't. The message of the book is that the only way to have friends and be happy is to destroy all that is unique and original about yourself. To destroy the individual.I suppose someone could write a children's book about how fun it is to rape and murder other children. Assuming that book isn't out there, Rainbow Fish is probably the worst children's book ever written.Terrible.the illustrations ARE lovely. Just not so lovely to override the terrible ""moral"" of the story."
3,Movie is great - Case was broken in two different places!,"The film itself is great! I don't often purchase movies, but it was an easy decision to add ""Sideways"" to my collection. However, the case itself was broken in two different places. Not a huge deal, and the movie seems to play fine, but it was disappointing to receive a damaged case."
2,"Teaches colors, that's about it","Like all of the author's books, the characters in this book are so stylized that they hardly hold any semblance to reality. Really seems inappropriate for young chilldren if you actually want to teach them what these animals look like. It is certainly passable if teaching colors is the only goal."
5,Good Belt,"Belt fits me well. I wear 34 size pants, so if you're in this range, then the Medium belt works well for you. I could probably use a small too, since I had to pull the belt through pretty far to get a tight fit. This really helps with my back, since I've learned my lesson after hurting it a few times too many while lifting."
1,Piece of junk!,"This DVD player skips badly, even for new DVDs. And at about 9 months the video output has stopped working. Don't but this piece of junk."
5,Awesome!,"Bought this for my 6 yr old who is currently obsessed with trains. Have watched it many, many times now! Very interesting for adults also. Highly recommend this for any youngster who loves trains. I also recommend I Love Big Trains part 1 & 2."
3,"short run time, mediocre selection","only ten songs, so only a 30 min or so run time; and of the ten songs selected, i would say that half were great, the other half were mediacore background music with no oomph.."
4,Wonderful Music...,"I am quite surprised that several of these tracks didn't make it on to MandA, namely Night on the Sun, So much Beauty in Dirt, and Here it Comes. The purchase price is at least worth these three songs, all of which compare to some of the best from any of their earlier works.However, I must admit that this album tends to go the same route as MandA, which to me is unfortunate. The polish and sparkle on MandA is beautiful and haunting, but doesn't have the raw energy present on Long Drive or Lonesome Crowded West.All in all, as a huge fan of the band over the years, I am quite satisfied with their latest work (though perhaps not as much as when I first heard LCW or Long Drive)."
1,Broken Link / No response to email,"I too found the link cited in the book to be broken, so I sent an email to the address I found on the www.paulmckenna.com webpage -- no response.I recommend against buying this book. Why reward Paul McKenna for treating his customers so poorly?"
5,"My, Oh My, Ohio!",Top performers well conducted all having lots of fun. One can not ask for any better than this. Simon Rattle is very good with L. Bernstein!
3,If I could give this a 3.5 star,"This is the first book of Three Sisters Island TrilogySetting: Modern TimesI would have given this a 3.5 star...Sweet story. Love the whole stalker and faking her death plotline, though wished she had close family still alive. This is a witch series: Nell, Ripley, and Mia1st book- ""Dance Upon the Air"" Nell's story2nd book- ""Heaven and Earth"" Ripley's story3rd book- ""Face the Fire"" Mia's story"
3,Audio Book Listener,"The characters in this book were well developed- but there were so MANY of them!I wanted to make a Family Tree just to keep them all straight!If you've never tried listening to Aduio Books, you should give them a try- they're WONDERFUL entertainment while doing housework, traveling, gardening, and you don't have to turn on the light when you want to ""read"" at night!"
5,Something we knew about hundreds on thousands of years ago,"Way to go Roy! Britain's best songwriter has still got it, and he proves he does with his epic new single. A multipart piece from different perspectives of people involved in the imperialist foreign military actions perpetrated by the USA, The Death Of God features Harper's trademark guitar, creative vocal arrangements, and cutting lyrics. This is some of Roy's most compelling work in the last few years, and I would recommend checking it out. The premise, I would say, is similar to Dylans ""With God On Our Side,"" insofar as the Bush Administration has claimed to have God on its side, as it were, but when the bottom fell out of the ridiculous war in Iraq and there were no WMD to be found, (in Roy's view) God was wrong, and he ""fell out the sky."" Great stuff, and it's a good thing Roy has his own label because a big one probably wouldn't allow this kind of sharp commentary. (...)"
2,"Bad 1970's disco...bad disco? Yes, it's true.",Some rediculously good beats and some stuff that I have to turn off. Meh. I've heard better DJ's. I won't buy another recording from him unless he leaves the 70's alone. I love some 70's disco but the mixes on this album are rough.
2,Falling apart,"Mine is falling apart after a couple of years of light use. But I will probably buy another one, because I love the functionality. Its really fast and easy to use."
3,All Right,This game is like a looney version of Metroid. You get great guns! I would not give this game to a little kid though it has some green blood on it on some levels.
1,Hogg 's book is not for breastfeeding families.,"Counter intuitive Breastfeeding and parenting information not grounded in the research about the fundamental developmental needs and behavior of a breastfed newborn. She is the next new dangerous fad in parenting books!Hogg is asking parents to replace tons of research and judgment with her authoritarian information about caring for a breastfeeding newborn. Parenting does not work that way and neither does breastfeeding. Remember she does not write from experience of being a parent, s he is not a medical professional or any other type of professional study.She is a nanny, a baby nurse.She is NOT a board certified lactation consultant."
2,Good story but it is not a book,"I bought this game for my 3 year old because of the great reviews. The games comes with a story and it is very cute however, you are not looking for a good book you are looking for a fun game.As a parent I look for a game that is educational and since of course I am going to be the one playing with my child I want it to be fun.well this game is NOT fun. There is nothing going on. you just pick a card and go, nothing is happening on the board there is nothing fun to do at all. Near then end if you dont have enough points you cant go through to the end and have to go in a circle forever. This is not very fun for me or my son.I suggest cariboo. This is a great fun game and it teaches counting, number recognition, colors, letters and sportsmanship."
3,No substitute for the Women's Utility,"Ironclad makes great gloves, and these are no exception. The problem is in the fit. Ironclad's old women's fit gloves,the Women's Utility (no longer available), were amazing. I went through two pairs a year doing barn chores, gardening, and hauling firewood. The fingers of these new gloves are significantly longer,leaving half-inch flaps at the ends of my fingers--just like most gloves, but not Ironclad's old women's fit. If you've got long fingers, these are great gloves. If, like me, you need gloves made for short fingers (a lot of women), keep looking."
2,FAIRYTALES CAN BE BORING,"If you collect the Plum hardcovers, well you of course will want this.It is a Plum fairytale with not much substance. Stephanie goes to her parents house for Christmas, Stephanie wants a tree but has no time or motivation to get one, Stephanie see Joes for two seconds here and there, Stephanie has a supernatural friend who is a hunk but pretty boring (personally, I think Ranger is having a bad dream and this book was it)."
2,Religious dribble for those with lots of spare time,"Maybe I don't understand Joyce's style or use of religion in this work, but I found this work totally dull and bloated. There's nothing that I hate more than a religous/spiritual epiphany."
1,Misleading,I ordered this item thinking that I would receive 10 since the item is listing says File Pockets...10 per box. I was astonished to find that I actually ordered 1 folder for $10.00!!!! Be careful to watch what you are purchasing.
3,A good album from an Indie band,"This was one of many of those bands where a group of young people who had heads full of ideas go into a studio and cut an album and it sold a few copies (a few thousand copies perhaps, but a few in relative terms)This is a good album. The band doesn't use scales, so their melodies are very unusual. The production could be better, but that's not a big deal. They are essentially a rock band. The lineup is guitars, bass and drums. The vocals are raw but decent. They tell weird stories. It isn't a very pop-sounding album, it's very raw and hard-edged. It's garage band-jamming, there's some good instrumental sections. Their lyrics are very weird, sometimes humourous stories. It has a fairly dark feeling aura to it, but it is essnetially raw-garage jams. I liked it, hope you will too, Brendan"
5,Excellent ! A timeless look about gamefish behavior.,"I read it 10 yrs ago and was impressed. Most or all recreational fisherman want to improve upon their productivity. A novice fisherman can learn where, when, how, and with what (s)he should do to improve productivity. For example: What do gamefish see? What is color to a fish? What causes fish to pursue your offering?"
5,"Baby says ""YES!""","Well paced, great songs, and cute idea with the babies singing. My daughter, Nadia, is only 13 months but really has fallen for the Singing Babies. She carries the DVD case around the house with her like a security blanket. If they start a Singing Babies Fan club, Nadia should be the club president."
4,Rock music lives again...,"The Darkness is perhaps the start of the rennaisance of rock music, it sounds like the rock music of old (or at least the 70s and 80s), when it wasn't particularly whiney and all the songs didn't sound a like (or feature some depressed guy mumbling).Catchy (and distinct guitar hooks), amusing lyrics, unique singing style (often falsetto), and more importantly, it sounds like they're having fun.It's an uneven album, with some good songs and some bad, but for the most part, it's very enjoyable. Besides ""I Believe in a Thing Called Love"", which is probably going to be considered a classic, ""Giving Up"" and ""Love on the Rocks with No Ice"" are great. The only songs I really hated were ""Black Shuck"" and ""Holding My Own"". (""Friday Night"" is pretty bad, too)"
3,Good Entertainment,Enjoyable read. good ties to the knights templar and current terroist threats. right vs. wrong long term choice was interesting.
2,certainly not automated,This book is basically about using moving averages. The author at times does not recommend using stop loss. Books by Elder + study guide I found to be more useful in money management area. The method is discretionary and is difficult to program into any computer for backtesting to see performance statistics.
3,Its ok for a simulator game,I am not much of a simulator fan of games. I bought it more becasue i am a trek fan and play several of thier computer games. Activision company gmaes I tried on the computer I liked so went with this. Have not really played it enough since i found out it was more of a simulator than strategy simulator like Starfleet command series games. More computer efficient than playstation efficient in gaming knowledge. I play it on my Playstation 2 and still trying to figure out hte controls (tells you how much I dont play the game :P)
2,NO! NO! NO!,"Hey remember me, I'm Franky R. I own every Hendrix ever released. So believe me when I tell you, Don't buy this!!!! It sucks! This is NOT! I say, This is NOT! Jimi in the west! I'm NOT happy with the Hendrix Family! Go buy the original JIMI IN THE WEST! PEACE!"
5,"""Sweetheart Of Song"" by Deanna Durbin","Am a Canadian. What more can I say? Being a self-styled ""musical-film historian"", this beautiful songbird from Winnipeg, Manitoba, was our contribution to saving Universal Studios, Hollywood, and, yes-the North American economy from financial ruin during the 1930s. She was a little girl with a big voice! Her videocassettes, CDs, and tapes will always be a part of my collection."
5,As Usual...,"This album was dropped a long time after it's expected release date simply because (as usual) the record label just dont know what to do with Untouchable legendary emcees(Rakim & Kool G Raps are 2 other examples) thankfully it was put out. Now the beats are well made but as usual it's Chino's lyrical skill and the colabos that make this album. My favorite track would be the one with Killah Priest, but the tracks with beatnutz & Proof(R.I.P.)are both dope. I'd say it's not as well produced as his last 2 records but still worth getting for a true Chino XL fan."
3,They wont stop breaking,These strings definitely sound great but have the worst reliability of any string I have used. I used to use Alchemy strings and had one set on for 3 years without one break. With these I have had 2 strings break in the last 6 months. If you are going to buy these i would advise buying two sets.
1,DRM - Manage This,"Spore looked like it'd be great fun, and I loved the marketing leading up to the launch (Creatures reacted by famous people, for instance), but the DRM makes it a no-go. Simply put, there's no way I'll pay $50 for a game that requires external authority. I feel offended as a consumer that EA feels they can treat me like dirt and expect me to still play their games. Just being activated externally is bad enough, but to limit it to three is adding insult to injury. I frequently replay games from years past for the fun of it, and knowing I'm buying the game to play through maybe once more means its a game I won't buy.Additionally, I wouldn't even ever pick this up used, since it may not have activations left. Just shoddy management all around."
4,You can relate,"Just finished this book last night; very entertaining. When I read, I envision the scene; I could see the characters and the house at Lily Pond; I would recommend this one. I feel as if I just visited down south and I'd like to go back; maybe to Lester's new condos he's going to build!"
1,FAULTY PRODUCT,DO NOT BUY THIS CLOCK RADIO! I purchased this and gave it as a birthday gift. Two months later the CD player died without warning. And it wasn't even used on a daily basis. At most three to four days a week.I have looked back at the other reviews listed here and found I am not alone. This is a poorly made product and chances are it will break for you too.
5,Hard-hitting story packed with real-world insights,"WHAT IS THE WHAT is no light story: it's the hard-hitting novel of one Valentino, a refugee of the Sudanese civil war fleeing from his village, who becomes one of the Lost Boys - children pursued by militias and shunned by the world. His long journey to the U.S. with some 4,000 other Sudanese refugees starts a new struggle for survival in this hard-hitting story packed with real-world insights and recommended for any literary fiction holding, whether it be public lending library or personal collection with an African focus.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
3,not as great as the first,"i liked LTE1, but this one was ok. Acid Rain was definatly one to like. Biaxident was pretty good, reminded me of Freedom of Speech from the previous album. 914 is interesting for its dark theme. i like another dimension as all of its odd time signatures. when the water breaks is ok. chewbacca is the only track which i dont like. Liquid dreams and Hourglass are probably the most soothing of them all. not a bad cd, but could have been better. otherwise, the musicianship is still at the top of its game."
2,I just don't hear it,"I have seen that some of the reviewers of this, the Third release by Big Star, claim it to be a classic. A dark testimony of a troubled artist flipping the bird to his management and the record industry. I just don't get it. A fan of the first two Big Star releases and no stranger to dark and daunting works by other artists, all I get from this is a feeling that Alex Chilton laughs his heinie off everytime he cashes a royalty check from sales of this album. A collection of unfinished pieces, dirges, fair, but unspectacular covers and unfocused songs, I have tried numerous times to try to get into it's murk without success. It probably does an excellent job of showing the state of the artist at the time, but honestly, how many times do you go back and listen to this if you own it? If you come to this expecting a legendary work, take the time to preview this before parting with your hard earned money. Buyer beware!!"
1,HP No.45 Black Ink Cartridge Twin Pack 51645A,I do not recommend this product. The ink was practically dry and useless. The package didn't protect the cartridge from drying. I had to change my printer because of expensive cartridges.
2,Boring,"While this is based on a great concept, I felt that it took too long to build up suspense and was not really that frightening."
1,Why waste my time with this remake?,"I never thought much of the original Omen. I found it long and dull. This movie is exactly the same. Generally when you remake a movie you do so to add things that maybe couldn't be done thrity years ago; you add special effects, you modernize language and style, you clean up the rough edges of the film. This remake does none of that. It is the exact same movie with new people. (And Julia Styles is a terrible actress.) The Omen 666 is reminiscent of the Psycho remake with Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche...they add NOTHING to the originals."
2,Small book for the price,"This book looked amazing in the picture. However, when I received it in the mail, it was quite dinky. The price is too much for the size of the book. I bought it for my hunter-boyfriend. I was disappointed when I finally got it."
3,wired router works ... but ...,"wired router works ... but ... with cable modem and power switch at the door it needs to be coaxed back into sharing the modem - looks ok for real time always live but would not recommend for a novice unless they have lots of time to access it with a browser and tweak it until it's happy - but for $25 it solves a problem so maybe it's ok for us, the last of the wired dinosaurs"
3,Sound is good but it is not long lasting,worked for less than 6 months. while it worked the sound was good but the life cycle was too short for me
1,VERY Disappointed,"I've really enjoyed James Patterson's other books, esp. the Alex Cross series, so I was looking forward to cracking this one open. I am so disappointed. I made myself finish the book, even though I really didn't care what happened to the characters. The book is VERY choppy, the plot is a bit ridiculous, and the ending is... well, I expected better of Mr. Patterson. Maybe because it's jointly written it's not quite as good as his regular stuff. Hoping that the next one I read meets my expectations."
4,All about redemption.,"A decent ""purgatorial"" novel about the redemption of a soul and what it takes. I often found myself thinking of Lewis's space trilogy during the read especially the last volume. I'd put this on a reading list of books about the theology of purgation; The Divine Comedy, The Great Divorce, etc.At times I found Williams writing style a bit thick but I suspect that was intentional. I particularly enjoyed what seemed to be a slam on logical positivism and literary post-modernism in the character of the clerk.Some classify this as horror and perhaps it is but it wasn't really scary to me. In fact, the clerk just winds up looking like a boob. Maybe the scariest thing about it is the choice one of the characters makes for hell."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I got this book for free and it was in the top 100 of its category on the day I got it. I was a little bit torn because it had a few 1 star ratings mentioning excessive profanity and bad grammar, as well as poorly drawn characters. Well, I am glad I gave it a chance. There was no profanity, I only found one typo. The plot and characters are well drawn. I enjoyed the book and plan on reading more from this author."
4,Works just like it should,I used this battery for 3 weeks to charge my psp (exclusively--I left the psp ac adapter at home) while traveling. I wish it had a charge indicator. That is the only reason I don't rate it 5 stars.
5,Perfect,The package was in great condition! 100%!I got this as a gift for my dad and he is Enjoying every minute of this hilarious TV show!
2,no perks!!!!!!,to many black and white pictures!!!!!!!!!!!!book would be better with ALL COLOR pictures to illustrate levels of color?????
4,Fun and easy read,This was the first book I've read by this author and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Very witty and enjoyable characters and story line. Will be reading more of her books.
2,Rehash,"This crap has already been released upteen times. Why dont you come up with something new Mr McDonald? Or tell your record company to release something then the same old crap that has been on the Best Of The Doobies, The Very Best of this, Greates Hits of that. BLAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Just a picture book,"I should have read more reviews before buying this book. It was about 2 pages of writing and the rest pictures. All the pictures looked like they could have all been taken at one run, because you see the same guys over and over. Also it's not a book of a few 1%er clubs as the title might have you think, but only OUTLAWS mc. Don't waste your money."
2,Good at first but it didn't last.,I bought these less than a year ago. The sound quality was quite good for my standards (I'm by no means an audiophile). Then the weather turned cold and every time I wore them outside I'd get little static shocks in my ears. This didn't happen if I was wearing them indoors. Now there is hardly any volume coming from the left bud. I was quite happy with these at first but now less then a year later I am very disappointed.
4,Intuitive Empaths,"The message of Positive Energy is to be mindful and from mindfulness comes a new kind of freedom, both in knowing one's self fully and in being fully present in one's life.Dr. Orloff offers great information about how to deal with life's issues. Where she's especially strong is as an empath and it's as an empath that her voice is most authentic."
1,"Great in Theory, Trama for me and Pup.","My 8 lb. maltese clawed/chewed through/got out of mesh webbing in 5 mins.-bleeding and all-back floor of car. My pup crying and tramatized, I cannot use this product. Unless animal is sedated or used to crating, forget about it. Believe me, don't waste your money and time. I cannot imagine shoving this product w/ your pet under an airline seat. p.s. I read these kind of reviews about this product before, but hoped it would not happen to me. Returning to PETCO store wonderful customer support but complicated because I purchased on-line."
2,pulp X hack,"the kind of book you wish you hadn't started but finished anyway - mediocre plot, predictable one-dimensional characters, unimaginative, flat writing, humorless, no drama, tension or surprises, whitewashed with thinly researched and mostly erroneous historical ""factoids"", even the soft-core scenes are clumsily done - amazing what gets into print - bought by mistaken click for 1.99 - and maybe worth it at that price - but really there are better ways to waste time. Gave it two stars only because it is possible to finish it if you have nothing else to do (I have a lot of down time at work...)"
4,Great first attempt by someone new to the movie scene,"While I was one of the two oldest people in the theater (my friend being the other), I actually really enjoyed this movie BECAUSE it is a scary movie that I would be okay taking my twelve-year-old brother to see. If this was meant to cater to twenty-somethings, I might have been disappointed, but it's supposed to be for teenagers so I pretty much knew what to expect upon entering (not quite sure why others seem surprised). The camera work was fantastic, acting was pretty good (especially the kid that played Owen) if perhaps a little over-done at times, and the story line had a few twists. I will take my little brother to see this and be comfortable, and he will love it (as did the other teens in the theater). Not bad for a first-timer."
1,Don't waste your money,"Brought two. The whole thing is made of plastic. It arrived with cracks all over the place. Tried stacking the two together, cracked. So it's basically it's a piece of junk, and that's putting it nicely. It's not even worth the money to ship it back."
1,Tokyo pop - Company out of touch,"My girls have been fans of Sailor Moon, Rayearth, Tenchi and many other series. We came across Saint Tail by accident, but my younger girls really enjoy the series and wait impatiently until the release of the next DVD. This release came as a big disappointment for them.I understand why the company chose to do this (lower cost for them), but I think they need to keep in mind their audience. It would have been easy for the company to either release two DVD products or to have included both languages on the DVD.I don't know if this change in format will stop us from buying further Saint Tail DVD's. It will all depend on if the consumers (my girls) fail to watch this DVD as much as the previous titles because it is too difficult for them to read and watch the action at the same time. The whole purpose for watching a movie is enjoyment, not frustration."
1,almost useless,"I was given this item and found the monitor aspect extremely poor quality. It has terrible reception and the listening device clicks constantly. The ceiling projection is very sweet though, so we bought a Clear and Near monitor with infinitely better sound quality and a rechargeable receiver and I leave the Fisher Price monitor set up just as an image projector."
5,Cool Tool!,"This is a pretty cool divot repair tool (not that I have a lot of experience using it...). It's ergonomic, sleek, and nice to have on the course. The ball markers also work well. The tool works well and seems to repair divots nicely."
2,My friend literally tricked me into seeing this (but I didn't fall for the trick),"When my friend and I were bored one night, we decided to watch The Good Shepherd on DVD. My friend saw it in theaters and said it was a waste of money (4 months ago). I knew it was boring, everyone said so, but still, I wanted to give it a chance. He also wanted to give it another chance. Well, that wasnt the case. I had to leave in the first 20 minutes because it was that bad. The only reason he wanted me to see it cause he wanted me to suffer through it like him. HAH! Well I knew better. I came back for the last 15 minutes of the movie (it was still on). I didnt understand what happened, but had I watched it through, I still wouldntve understood. Haha, my friend was so mad at me for not having to watch it.Watching this movie is like being shot with a tranquilizer. You better escape before it gets to you."
5,pirate figurines,"The pirate figurines are durable, well made and are depicted well.I used these on a pirate ship cake and they are exactly what I needed to show action. I would purchase this product again should the need arise."
3,Not enough Umph!,"Although I enjoyed reading TMOAGT, I thought Ms. Roby could have had more flava to her writing. It was almost like she held back, and gave more along the lines of a step by step guide of the plot...but it was for the most a take-my-time-read because I already knew where it was going...too predictable. I didn't race through it like CTFS perhaps because that was my first introduction to greedy Pastor Curtis Black."
4,Interesting,I Have learned a lot about the Doris Day i didn't knowWell researched and put together very enjoyable
2,BB Reference Guide Review,"Overall the reference guide was not as informative as I expected. I also expected that the Guide would have contained more information, relating to the program itself. I may be incorrect, but sensed the Guide was written by a non-progam person.The contents, more specifically, word listings are readily available through a number of search engines, which in my opinion are more complete.The idea of presenting key individuals significant to the program is interesting, but also available in more detail through alternate sources.The product was delivered before the scheduled date, well packaged, and in excellent condition. This part of the transaction I would rate as 5 Star"
4,Summer Read,"Catherine Coulter never fails to deliver. This is a good, summer read. Romance with some intrigue. Not the best intrigue I've ever read, but worth your time while sitting at the pool. I enjoyed it, overall.No Child Left Behind? The True Story of a Teacher's Quest"
1,Horrible. Just search google!,Keep away from this drive - particularly firmware V7.01. This drive was installed in many Apple products including Macbooks and Mac Minis and all are failing in an unrecoverable way.[...]
2,"Not that good, but love the direction","As with any mega artist that has been around for 20 years and released a crazy amount of singles and albums. Not everything by that artist is great. This is a prime example, while I thought Cowboy Style and Breathe were two very good songs that i play occasionally. The rest is really just filler. Drunk? Seriously, it's lame techno beats over her saying drunk(haha ok maybe not to that extreme but that's what it felt like to me). After hearing Cowboy style I expected this album to be really good,but was disappointed. I will say one thing, she did do any intersting job of fusing techno along with scottish/british rhythmns on her last few tracks. Other then that some of this album is like a bad kelly clarkson cd(even thought this did come out way before), and the other half a lame techno party. I would buy this album if your into electronic music, but other then that I wouldn't waste any money on it."
5,Simply divine...,"Having grown up in India and gifted several Indian artifacts and books to friends worldwide, I have always wondered what gift would best capture the spirit, sights, and sounds of such a diverse culture, landscape, and environment. No single work of art could possibly do so, but this book comes close, evoking such fond and strong memories and visions of India, that this has, over the past decade, become THE one book I would encourage people to go through, to get a mesmerizing glimpse of India.Mainly pictorial, and close to being a coffee table book (not hardbound though and the binding could be a lot better...), it is by far the best book to encompass a range of visual images including India's landscape, its people, and hints of its cultural past and present. You will not be disappointed. Its a book not easily available, but if you ever come across it, don't think twice before grabbing a copy."
1,Truly awful,"I thought this film would be fun, but I had expected it to be an homage to the old flicks like The Car. Instead we have a boring bunch of incredibly foul-mouthed and brainless women interminably babbling, and finally, at the end, a distasteful car chase with (spoiler) a woman on the hood of a car. It even manages to make Kurt Russell seem gross. Yech! I loved Tokyo Gore Police, but this is so much of a mess that it's not even campy. I can't believe I watched all the way through to the end."
5,Reliable and very convenient,I took this converter to a very long European trip. It worked just fine. My family members were using it for both high-wattage and low-wattage appliances. It was very handy to have a single converter for all cases. What can I say - it worked as supposed and didn't break. The set of 5 different adapters (all types used on the planet) was very handy too.
1,Disappointed with Presto,"We purchased this item to make fried sopapillas. The recipes we found online all required the oil to be heated to 375. Also, the cookbook that came with the fryer says to cook some of the items at 375 degrees. When we began frying the sopapillas, they were not cooking correctly. We checked the oil temperature with our electronic cooking thermometer to see if it was hot enough. The temperature would never get above 340. My wife called Presto today to ask if there was something we should be doing to get the oil heated to 375 degrees. The customer service representative from Presto told her that ""The machine goes up to 375, but the oil will never get above 340"". In disbelief, my wife asked if she was understanding correctly, to which the representative again said, the oil will only get to 340. So, if you're thinking about purchasing this unit and you need the oil to be hotter than 340, Presto does not guarantee this unit will get your oil hot enough to cook anything above that."
4,one of the funniest books ever!,"Not high art, but SOOOOO funny! I loved it as a kid, my son loves it now...and I still find it laugh out loud hilarious."
5,Perfect for me.,Clock is small enough to fit on my overloaded nightstand. Brightness can be dimmed low enough to not bother me at all in the dark of the night. Alarm setting is simple. Double alarms come in very handy.
1,Probably the worst Sparks album ever,"I'm an unashamed Sparks fan but in this album they sound like a sad shaddow of their normal original selves. The songs feel thin in production and the electronic edge lacks the sort of originality that one sensed in ""No One Song In Heaven"" (which I never really liked but could appreciate for those who like that sort of synth-rock)It feels like they were trying to get back a bit of their 1970s sound but without giving up the euro-pop feel. And the result falls between two stools and simply doesn't really work.It's only an album to buy for completeness if you're a diehard fan and feel so inclined."
4,Beautiful and fun!,"This Emma is more fun and more understanding. The cast is perfect, Romola Garai is perfect as Emma Woodhouse, Jonny Lee Miller as Mr. Knightley. I gave it four stars because the very end is not enough pomp for four episodes. With all the great language included. There are balls and more along the line of those Jane Austen may have attended. Lovely!!!!!"
4,saw them live,"dont expect a highly polished overly produced hillary duff type sound. but they have originality, real creativity, quirk and charm. this is indie pop made by middle school kids, to all those who complained, i'd like to see u try to make something better. i think some songs r better than others thats y its a 4 star rating, but they really get a lot of bang outta a drum set and keyboards. they play pretty flawlessly live. and from the preview of new songs, the next cd will show some growth."
3,Its got Clonus - that's about it,"I Really enjoy MST3K but can't Rhino release better shows for over $35.00+ bucks?! I mean, there is usually just the one really good one like on this set Parts - the Clonus Horror - nothing much else. The same with volume 11, all that was really there was Tormented. Why can't we see Screaming Skull, Devil Doll and Zombie Nightmare? And probably now we will never see Godzila Vs. the Sea Monster, since Rhino is going to the trouble of Re-releasing Volume 10 with a different show in place of Godzila Vs. Megalon. Which I don't think is fair to those of us who already bought volume 10 - we'll have to buy the same volume all over again just for that one extra show."
3,my disc 3 won't play! ugh!,Disappointed because disc 3 keeps reading 'no disc detected!!!!! Now i don't want to watch the rest bc Im going to be lost!!!!!
1,My dear friends!,"Some of the favorable reviews seemed a little confused as to what truth is. Speculation is not truth. This book is fiction like the Da Vinci Code, without excitement or RESEARCH. Or very limited research.Oh, and by the way (to those who think that I am a Merton worshiper), I very much doubt that anyone worships Merton (for obvious reasons)."
3,"OK, depending on what you're looking for","As a Domino admin running R6 for several months (and R5 for several years), I was hoping for more detailed server info than this book has. I think if you are a Notes power user or just getting into Lotus programming, this may be a good reference. It is not really an administration reference. I will not be using this book, but plan to make it available to my users. I will be waiting for Kirkland's next book to be released."
5,AMAZING!,I love the whole series and I recommend it for anyone ages 11 and up. Meg Cabot is my favorite author and this book WOW'd me more than any other book I've read by her! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
3,???,"I thought that book (Up a Road Slowly) was boring.It wasnt for me, but i thought she did a good job writing it. the charecters seemed real,like they were ure friends.The book is more for girls rather than boys...."
1,nice if it worked,"crucial online help useless,claimed product number wasnt their part,1 gig of two not ""seen""....64 bit mem sent for 32 bit os... since anything was better than 512 I just kept it....hassle to return. slot still shows empty...they fought me the whole way though I was pleasant and patient......I think it was just a bad day for me.---heed...Crucial fought me the whole way,even though I was patient and pleasant.ie its your fault. oh well..not gonna sweat it..gonna buy a voodoo anyways...so ill just give it free to one of my customers. and use someone else next time.I have installed over 1000 kits from other ""lame brand"" ie chineese with nary a problem and quick change out when I got a dead stick....which happens more often than people realize.things happen .. its how you fix the problem not whether a problem occurs."
5,Fantastic,"Bought one for home and work. Guys at work love it, clean up is great the way it snaps apart. Found it is great for slicing pre-sliced meats and cheese into cracker size pieces also."
3,Left a little to be desired...,"I am a huge fan of the first two books in the series, and I was really expecting the same kind of intensity that books one and two had. Most of the story takes place on another planet in another dimension, and I didn't like it as much as the previous two books where everything occured in our world.My final recommendation: Read it only after the first two books in the series. The fourth book is definitely worth the effort."
2,Save Your Money,Save your money unless what your looking for is to hear the auther write 90% about how much he is not taking you for a ride and only 10% about the subject of the book.
1,No longer a fan,I like the old books by Heather Graham so much more than the newer ones. I will no longer purchase any of her books until the book has been reviewed by several people. I'm also irritated with the publishers for putting this kind of trash out in hardback format.
2,Loved the concept but in reality did not perform,"Loved the concept, but after using for one week, the plastc ""rivits"" that the main frame grabs on to, to spin the grinder frayed and will no linger spun to grind. I am very upset. I did not save the box so I'm stuck with a product I spent $50.00 for with no ability to return it and no contact number to discuss my experience with. I'm very dissatisfied."
5,DVD RELEASE DATE SET,"May 6, 2003 is the date ""CMD"" will FINALLY be released on DVD. Twenty-three years (!) after it's initial release, one of my favorite films will be given the Collector's Edition treatment. : )""The more I laugh, the hornier I get"""
3,"Morals, oh please!","The author did a wonderful job in developing the characters, however I had difficulty with the morals of the main character Mel. Mel had a rough childhood. Her fathers death, her mothers inability to deal with his infidelity, and her resentment towards her brother caused her so much pain that she just couldn't deal. I don't understand why she just didn't ask her brother for the financial help that would have prevented so much additional pain. Afterall, he did volunteer to help.The relationship between Mel and her husband should have ended long before the rape took place. They were awful towards one another. Builder wasn't a businessman and should have allowed Mel to help him. Afterall, that is supposed to be the goal of a marriage - teamwork!Interesting read."
2,The only 2Pac-album I don't like...,"I'm a big fan of Tupac Shakur (he's my favorite rapper), but I think he went too far on this album. He's dissing eastcoast-rappers such as the Notorious B.I.G, Jay-Z and Nas on almost every single song. It gets kinda boring, and the production is pretty dull and boring. The beats suck on most of the songs. I think this album is so overrated. Me Against The World is Tupac's best album. No doubt.R.I.P Tupac Shakur AKA Makaveli 1971-1996"
3,Great Sounds for One Ear,The Lyrics and beats on here are great. The style is one of a kind and a great listen to my left ear. I have a problem that I was blessed with two working ears and only get to hear the music in one. Post if you have the same problem because only one other person has the same problem and it is a majior problem. CD is still a must for any hip hop head or collector but hard to get a full feel out of one ear
1,Arrived Broken,"Needed in time for Christmas.Opened box & found this in 2 broken pieces.Oh well, guess I'm still the back scratcher."
4,A Dictionary of The Da Vinci Code,"This is a good little reference work for people who have been exposed for the first time to the Bloodline/Grail theories found in The Da Vinci Code. Cox gives each item its own dictionary-style entry with a factual description that is anywhere from a half page in length to three pages. As Cox writes, ""This book is designed in such a way as to give the reader of The Da Vinci Code a primer on many of the factual elements in the book."" I found the color photos especially helpful so that I could see for myself what is being talked about. This book has been faulted for Cox's unabashed support of The Da Vinci Code, but clearly that is what inspired him to put this volume together."
1,wrong roles for a dame,"Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, with all my applauding hands on her appearance in other recordings like Bernstein's West Side Story with José Carreras, and with all my respect for a fantastic career recently ended, I have to say that in standard songbooks used to play a wrong role, by compulsive advancinng herself to the refrains of songs, at the point that it seemed that she was the orchestra conductor at the moment: the musical effect produced is anoying and hard, please note that on 'Kiri sings Porter' almost all tracks were originally meant for male roles."
2,Pretty Cheesy and convoluted,"This move is basically trying to be Harry Potter, but just can't pull it off. The plot is pretty ridiculously convoluted, none of the characters are really developed all that deeply, and its basically just a bunch of cheesy CGI. (Complete with the bear from the Coke Christmas commercials) I didn't like this movie essentially for the same reason people didn't like the new star wars movies, its just all action and cheesy CGI, no real heart to it. Just a mush of wannabe Harry Potter with toned down versions of Lord of the Rings scenary, and maybe a hint or two of Magic the Gathering or World of Warcraft (Hey, the bears armor was soulbound!) I gave it two stars because I found it mildly entertaining, despite the fact I found myself still laughing more at the movie than with it."
3,Mediocre Chip Davis,"The arrangements are good except quality lacks. The tracks are frequently different sound levels, so one must constantly turn up or down to hear clearly."
4,Baby in 'Family Bed',"Think this would have been a great product but we ended up putting our little guy in a pack 'n play next to our bed...only other thought, I agree with other reviews in that this bed is a little short."
5,Excellent Metallurgical Reference in Non-Ferrous Metals,I think this book is unique in its content-no other book has such a comprehensive coverage in the metallurgy of non-ferrous metals. It is well written and has a pickupable easy to read style. Finding information on specific non-ferrous metals is very easy. The figures are also very clear.
2,they forgot the harpsichord,I was very disapointed with these cd's. I got them instead of Pinnock just because so often the violin concertos are tacked on to Bach recordings and I already had Grumiaux and was satisfied. But the harpsichord is so thin it is merely an ornament and relativily unimportant. I ended up going back for Pinnock. This might not be a bad background Christmas cd though.
2,Trochanter belt,"Belt itself has not held up well. Approximately 1 month of use and it looks years old. For a short term use, this inexpensive belt is good, but I would recomend paying for a higher quality brace."
1,Time Thieves,Time Thieves is one of Dean Koontz's first books. It is absolutely horrible. This is the first one that I thought was bad.
5,Grandson Fascinated By Escalators,"I have a Grandson who is extremely fascinated by Escalators. I had even gone to the point of capturing pictures off the Internet and creating him a book. This book is now one of his favorite books. If your son or grandson has this fascination, I highly recommend it."
1,Author obviously has NO idea,This book totally misconstrues the Catholic Faith. It takes the Bible itself out of context as well as all Catholic references. It is a sad display of untruth. For a true view of the Catholic faith read a good book like Catholism and Fundementalism By Karl Keating
3,"a good watch, but..","actually, i bought that as a replacement for my other ""coleman"" watch, which is the exact model as this one.it lasted many years, and held up great through rapid rides and LOTSA bangs, but the buttons had become hard to push, so i thought i'd just get another one..the problem is that i actually use the timer and alarms, and oddly the volume on this new one is so low i can barely hear it when it goes off.funnily enough, just today i almost missed an alarm, but suddenly my cat started looking at my arm, so i realized my watch had gone off.my previous one was much louder, and i can't see anywhere online about adjusting any kind of volume, so i'm guessing either they altered this feature since my last version, or i got a dud this time.kinda sucks cuz i just threw out the box it came in.otherwise i'd send it back for a replacement.still, as a watch, it does exactly what it's supposed to do, so i guess it's not all bad.."
5,a terrific find,"I have recently been studying Jainism and stumbled across the recordings of Rajaudio in a titles listing. I was so excited I had 6 titles in my cart before I knew it, but then decided I would be more cautious and choose one to start with and hope for the best. I was absolutely blown away by how much I enjoyed this album. Both the players and vocalists give a feeling of ""classical"" Indian music but bring it up to date with some shining extras. I will definitely be buying those albums I didn't get the first time around, and probably more. If you enjoyNiyaz,Kiran Ahluwalia's self titled album, Shree Maa'sShiva Is in My Heart, Gypsy Caravan'sQuest, or the more tribal sound of Solace'sRhythm of the Dance, this is an album for you."
1,Broomfield's depiction of science is both wrong and one-sided,"First, let me be clear that I have only read the Introduction and Chapter 2 (which deals with quantum physics and the ""scientific articles of faith"").Even if I set aside the numerous straw-man arguments the author uses in his attempt to paint science in a bad light I had to come here and mention that his descriptions of the quantum physics is misleading in many places and flat out wrong in a few places. This clearly stems from a lack of understanding on Broomfield's part and it is disappointing that he didn't learn a bit more before trying to speak credibly on the subject.So read this book if you must, but know that the science discussed here is incorrect and that many of the statements made about science itself are caricatures and straw-men.Again... let me be clear that I have not read the entire book and cannot speak to the other parts."
1,"Dont buy its a waste of your oils, time and money.",I had the diffuser for just a couple weeks and the diffuser burned the oils instead of slowly dispersing them. The thing wasnt even powerfull enough to work in one bedroom and broke after falling off of my 1 foot night stand onto my rug!!! Spend just a little more money on a better one or you'll regret it and end up having to replace it within a month or two.
5,Good quality light,"I purchased 3 of these while it was on sale for $29.99. They look awesome and appears to have good quality.So far, I installed one at the front door entrance and the installation was easy and straight forward. I also purchased a photo-sensor timer control and put in the CFL bulb into this and it works flawlessly.Overall, very happy with the purchase. Well worth the money, in my opinion."
1,Samsung Warranty Repair,"Samsung is not on my Christmas list!RMA support and repair of existing Monitors is 1/2 star and attempts to escalate were denied.Overall support is poor at best. I decided to give ASUS VE248H - 24"" a chance making Sansung'slack of support a non issue."
5,Dog lover is disc happy!,"For anyone just getting started in disc-dog sports, this video is it! The training video answered all my questions and covered every topic in the sport from A-Z. I could barely throw a disc, but with the demonstration and step by step guidance, I am throwing like a pro now! I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn how to play and throw with your family pet."
5,A sentimental favorite,"I purchased this book after seeing ""The Man Who Saved Christmas"" on TV in December. My older brother, now in his 60's, was a huge erector set fan as a kid and grew up to be an engineer. He said he actually remembered Gilbert's name from the ouside of the set's box! Anyway, he really got a kick out of the book. Gilbert's true-life story is remarkable and particularly inspiring for those of us who grew up in the Kennedy days of trying to be the ""best and the brightest."" It also would make a great gift for any academically inclined young person."
2,"Compared to previous releases, nothing special here","First off. Common?? Neptunes?? Neptunes as in the same production team that did Hot in Herre and Im a slave 4 you? Seems like Common sense that he is trying to broaden his audience. And the cover of the album?? What the hell is that? What is he trying to do, get a Ben Kravenston look?"
5,great band!,"Dizzy was a true master. He has spread his mastery onto countless numbers of people including all who are on this great cd. Jon Faddis is an extreme player. He plays high, low, loud, soft, fast, slow, furious, and beautiful. His highnotes are very controlled and have a great tone. The big disappointment of the cd is the fact that Slide Hampton does not solo. He arranges many of the songs and plays in the band, but has no improvisation. Steve Turre does take a couple of nice trombone solos.The arrangements by Slide are some of the best ever. Lush full orchestration with unique colors being used together.Roy Hargrove also plays in the band, as well as Lewis Nash, and Jimmy Heath. With them and other well known players, the band is truly an all star assembledge. All great Gillespie tunes made for a bebop big band(3sax,3tbone,3trpt,rhythm section). Worth twice as much as the asking price."
3,Not bad,Film not bad. Moved a bit slow for us. Did have decent character development. Actors did a nice job with the material given.
3,"Product seems well built, once it's assembled","First, I must give bad marks to Amazon for shipping me a resealed package which did not include the instructions and warranty materials. I'm still trying to resolve this with them. Also, I cannot find the McCulloch web page anywhere, so bad marks to them for customer service. Fortunately, another reviewer posted very good instructions and I was able to assemble it in under an hour.The product itself works well and I'm very happy with it. I don't need it for branches bigger than about an inch, since I burn those in my fireplace. For smaller branches, twigs, and debris it works great. Bear in mind that it is not for industrial use - it's much too slow. For homeowners keeping the hedges and trees under control it's just right.I give the product 5 stars, but knock it down to 3 for bad customer service."
3,This floss seemed like it would work fine ...,"This floss seemed like it would work fine for most people, but it didn't for me. Some of my teeth are close together and when flossing those, this floss got stuck and then """"broke"""" in my teeth. I think it's a decent product but just didn't fit my needs."
5,Good book for teenager girls,"I would recommend this book for all teenage girl. It is about a young teenage girl getting pregnant at the age of 14. It's really sad how her boyfreind treated her and abused her. He would always call her bad names. When she told him that she was pregnant he just left her and told her that he didn't care and that it wasn't his baby. But Annie's mom was very supportive of her. Annie's mom worked two jobs just to pay all the bills and she didn't even yell at Annie when she told her that she was pregnant. I think that this book would be a good reason why girls should wait to do it. And the saying ""everyone's doing it"" isn't true because everyone isn't."
3,The game isn't too bad. Multiplayer is the key feature.,"The game isn't too bad. Building the robots isn't too difficult when selecting parts and weapons. Control is good as well. However, single player tournament mode seems a bit short and doesn't really inspire you to want to play it again and again to try building different robots.However, multiplayer mode is what helps save the game. Playing against other people with their own designs in a multiplayer rumble is rather fun."
2,Disappointed,I was very disappointed reading this book. Didn't really recognize the Kellerman touch.
2,Not what I was expecting.,"The flashlight is very cute, but when I tried to put it on all I got was a very very faint light. Turns out 2 out of the 3 batteries exploded and that's why the light wont work. Now, not only have I paid 6 dollars for this flashlight, I have to go to the store and buy new batteries. This is why I rated it so badly, I mean if you pay for something to come with batteries and ready to work it should be so."
2,Well researched but lacking in enjoyment.,"This book was clearly well researched..It includes a plethora of information on the bounty and its sailors. However, the book can be extremely monotonous. The story also bounces around a lot making it hard to follow at times. If your looking for a narrative on the bounty this is not it, however if your a fan of the bounty story and its research interests you than this is the book for you."
5,I think I'm in Love,"We bought this movie as a Christmas present for ourselves. We love classic movies, but had never seen any of the Thin Man movies. We decided to buy the whole set, and what a wonderful surprise. It took a lot of self control to NOT watch them all in one weekend. Like everyone else has been saying, William Powell and Myrna Loy have a great on screen chemistry. Not just the dialog, but the looks, the expressions, the exchanged glances.And yes, I think that I have fallen in love with Nora Charles."
5,A Great RPG!,"One of the best martial arts/sci-fi RPGs out there. Great on its own, and awesome as a supplement to the rest of the Palladium Megaverse (16 character classes, 41 martial arts systems, cybernetic augmentation, plus a lot more). A great RPG."
4,"THE BEST SEQUEL , THE DVD FEATURES ZERO STARS","THIS SEQUEL TO THE FIRST BATMAN MOVIE IS ONE OF THE BEST. AGAIN MICHAEL KEATON RETURNS AS BATMAN/BRUCE WAYNE HE AS ALWAYS DID A GOOD JOB AS THIS CHARACTER, THEN DANNY DeVITO DID A GOOD JOB AS THE PENGUIN/OSWALD COBBLEPOT AND LAST BUT LEAST MICHELLE PFEIFFER DID AN EXTRAORDINARY JOB AS CATWOMAN(SHE LOOKS SEXY IN THAT OUTFIT)BUT AGAIN AS THE SPECIAL FEATURES ZERO STARS BECAUSE AS WITH THE FIRST ONE IT HAS NOTHING.BATMAN 5/5BATMAN RETURNS 5/5BATMAN FOREVER 2/5BATMAN AND ROBIN 1/5STICK WITH BATMAN AND BATMAN RETURNS."
4,THE FRAY,I really love this music. I like the meloncoloy of the words and how they both mesh together to make this lovely to listen to songs. This is a must buy for anyone who enjoys light rock/alternative music.
1,Was Sent Two Different Size Chicks,"I Ordered two penquin chicks, they arrived today and when I opened the box I was very confused one chich is about 4 inched tall (as stated in the product discription) and the OTHER ONE is about 9 inches tall. Very frustrating when you order two of the same products but you receive two different products. I dont think anyone checks what they put into the boxes. Beware if you wnat more then one they may not be the same product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Loved It,"I have always loved Neil Young's music. Takes me back, but still the music is as great today as it was in my youth."
4,Jillian kick butt!!!!,"Jillian is like she is on the show. It is tough at first. It says 30 day shred, but I only did it 3 times a week instead of everyday. My muscles were sore for the first week. You need a small set of hand weights and a mat for sit-ups. I liked the fast paced part of it. She changed exercises every 2 minutes. That way if it is difficult, I knew I could last for 120 seconds. Includes jumping jacks, took me back to grade school."
1,An unfortunate effort.,Flat characterizations and no emotional development mark this text by Phillips. The author seems so insistent on presenting his theme that he neglects the true art of storytelling.
5,Jillian Michaels Killer Abs,Product arrived in excellent shape and I absolutely love the workout. Jillian is quite the motivator for exercise. Using it with my other workouts for a full body routine.
2,Poor QC,"This is the second Irwin guide I have purchased and the basic design is pretty good. Unfortunately, this one was horribly inaccurate - the laser line was at least 1/8"" away from the cut line. Thankfully, I was able to get the original working again and plan to return the new one."
2,HealthCare Acu-Point Pen,"Item arrive okay. Unfortunately, it seems to work well for diagnostics, but doesn't seem to work when it comes to applications for doing some self- electronic accupuncture relief. Don't know if the unit is just defective or is a faux product."
4,Too academic for the average reader,"I was a student of Prof Cameron at Old Dominion and it amazes me that people advocate book burning just because they disagree with his ideas. He was decried as a racist on campus and these fools denounce him for sitting in an ivory tower. This book is written as an academic work and should be treated as such. It has to be taken dispassionately, I'm a former Marine and not did not see anything revisionist in his work. If you are too afraid to hold a mirror to yourself don't read this book---stick to Clancy-he uses small word and easy sentences."
3,Do not get this game,"This game isn't very good. I read the previous reviews and they stated that even if you don't like snowboarding (like me), you would like this game. That is unfortunately not true. The game play got boring for me extremely quickly. If you don't like snowboarding, SSX Tricky is not worth your money."
3,Put on by Cunning by Ruth Rendell,It just wasn't up to her usual sneakiness I saw it coming. I am still a fan of ruth so I'll keep on.Chandler Smith.
3,"Good Sound, but...","Great sound quality for the price I payed (under $10 - includes tax and shipping). I gave it 3 stars, because after a week or so, I can no longer hear the sound on the right ear piece. I thought about returning it, but I didn't beacause it's a hassle and I can still use the headset with just the left ear piece."
4,Surprise someone you love--this is a great gift CD,"When I first heard this album on NPR two years ago, I was stunned. Peyroux sounds like Billy Holiday filtered through Patsy Cline by way of Edith Piaf. Her phrasing is fabulous, especially given her young age when the CD was cut. My only gripe is that sometimes she sounds too much like Lady Day, Patsy, or Piaf. I cannot wait for her to develop her own voice and sound--it will be incredible when she matures and deepens. I hope a second album is coming soon--I will get it immediately. Give this as a gift and you will be seen as a true afficianado! By the way, Marc Ribot is on guitar on this album--for another special treat, listen to his Marc Ribot Y Los Cubanos Postizos, a wonderful Cuban-inspired guitar CD."
4,good buy does as is claimed leaves dog fully groomed!,"good value, and she loves bieng groomed with it! strong sturdy construction, and very easy to clean, ergonomically designed with ease of use in mind! All pet lover's should have one! Very fast delivery! *****"
1,disappointing,"This book was a waste of time and money, the last time I was this disappointed in a book was ""hannibal"". The plot was ridiculous, you know from the biginning that there are 4 days till xmas, steph is hunting a bail jumper only to let him go because it's xmas eve! this author could have done much better especially w/a xmas theme."
1,This book is boring!,"I watched the movie first with that Mandy Moore girl and really liked the movie. It was cute and sweet. So I was excited to read the book. ... I've never came across a movie that was better then the book until now. This book was terrible. Badly written and (YAWN) boring! It went on and on and on. I finally had to put it down and read something else. SAVE YOUR MONEY, DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!"
3,Perfect for my ties,Perfect fit to hold my ties. Perfect fit for the budget. Perfect timing arriving to my door to be put to use.
3,Too many mistakes!,"I bought the book to try the pastry recipes and it has really disappointed me. There are typos and mistakes in the amounts and ingredients. Such as saying egg yolk instead of egg white (p:282) or saying the dough will rise when there is no Leavening agent in the recipe (p:284). It might not make a big difference in savory dishes, but for pastry details matter. I just wish better proofreading was done."
1,Not as Advertised,"Just a quick note to buyers that the item description is in not accurate. These dragon lamps do not take a 75 watt bulb, in fact they only take a 7 watt night light. So they can not be used to read or light a room. The dragon artwork is nice but I can not use them as I intended because of misleading descprition."
3,Too Shiny - a review of Sandstorm,"First, the good news. This eyeshadow lasts and it doesn't crease. I don't know about 12-hours of wear, because I don't wear makeup for that long during the day, but it certainly last 8-hours although it might be a tad shear at the end.Now for the bad news. I tried the ""Sandstorm"" and despise the color. For one thing the darkest shade looks much lighter than it appears in either the picture or the container. I wanted a dark, subtle brownish shade, but it's none of these things. The darkest shade is so shiny and light in color that I'd never consider wearing it to the office. It's like something you'd expect a teen to wear. Too light for a sophisticated look.Pam T~"
5,Magnificent,Summertime is one of my favorite films. Katharine Hepburn and Rossano Brazzi are superbly cast in this great film. Venice isa dream. Sad ending though. I would have stayed in Venice.
1,"Utterly useless, the wood bows and the shelves fall.","I don't need to say more than that. The side wood is not straight, it bows outward and the pegs are too short, so the shelves literally fall off the pegs and your DVDs go crashing to the floor. This thing is terrible and a waste of money, don't buy it."
1,"I'm sorry,","but this was one of the dumbest things I have ever seen. I saw it on TV and was telling a friend about how horrible it was but I couldn't remember the name. I went here to look up all of Hackman's movies and found the title. After seeing all the good reviews, I had to respond.I love parody as much as the next guy. This was just too stupid to be true."
3,"Excellent content, but poor writing.","In terms of its content, this is definitely the best introductory text to operating system and concurrency. Unfortunately, Jean Bacon's writing style has caused tremendous headaches among her students at Cambridge. This is how one student used to put it:""Every word has its meaning, but when they were put together, they make no sense in Jean Bacon's book!"" My personal experience was that I had to read the same paragraph at least 3 to 4 times in order to understand the message. In short, this book is for serious reader only. You need all the patience, and determination in order to finish reading this book. (like us, who had to answer the exam questions she set!)"
5,Poignant tales,"""After Many Days"" is one of my favourite thematic volumes of LMM's short stories. These stories deal with people who set things ""right"" after years of misunderstanding or absence. ""In the Old Valley"" and ""Between the Hill and the Valley"", both stories of love which survives time and separation, are among my favourite LMM stories out of any collection. There are no surprises in this book - if you are familiar with LMM's work you will find more of the same here. This collection stands out from the others for its honest poignancy, which strikes me anew every time I read it."
4,Almost Medicore,This is a pretty good Cd. I really enjoy Gasoline and Cochise. This album however does not reflect the full potential this band can achieve. The lyrics have lost their political side and its mainly the Chris Cornell lyrics common to his Soundgarden albums. Anyway highly reccomended!
4,Great Portrayal of an African American Family!,This was my favorite season of Soul Food. It is realistic and I absolutely love the chemistry between Boris and Nicole!
2,bad soundtrack,"lovely picture quality but bad soundtrack transfer. the cute 'come out' song is particularly bad - the orchestra sounds 'wobbly'. my old vhs copy is way better.a pity, because this early sinatra movie has some musical gems."
1,Shockingly bad,"Alright, I will admit I've only read the New Yorker short story. But that was awful - mannered, self-absorbed and completely false. I find it hard to believe that the novel can be much better. I have spent years working in Ukraine, speak Russian and Ukrainian, and I found the character of Alex simply ridiculous. Evidently Alex's butchering of English is supposed to be humorous, but unfortunately none of his dialogue sounds anything like a native-Ukrainian speaker attempting to speak English. Caricatures are not funny when they're painfully off-key. I'm shocked that this is the book of the season. If you want a good, funny, real novel about Ukraine try ""Death and the Penguin."""
3,IT's OK...,"There are 2 songs in this collection that are absolutely INCREDIBLE! Those 2 songs are ""Mary, Did You Know"" and ""Don't Save it all for Christmas Day"" However, these songs aside, this CD is just OK. I mean, Clay Aiken has a good voice and all, but, in my opinion, he doesn't shine on here the way he did on his ""Measure of a Man"" cd. The songs just come off as a little boring actually. And I love Christmas music. You know what, though, before anyone gets mad and threatens me :o Clay Aiken is still a great singer and I know that all of his die-hard fans will love this CD. (They actually probably own it already) I give it a slight recommendation because of the 2 great songs. :)"
2,Very Average,Stevie Wonder is one of my All-Time Favorites Period.He is a Musical Genius.but This isn't his Genius here.Only two songs stand Out Sensuous Whisper&Cold CHill.His Writing is hurting on this DIsc.The Music is Lacking that Stevie Edge.After His Live Set I was Hyped for this Disc but it wasn't Happening but you can't take away The Man's Genius.
4,Beware --incuded power adapter is NOT 220-240V compatible,"Bought this hub for primarily overseas use. Typically what I find overseas is junk, and like other reviewers, I have tried just about everything out there and ended up returning them one and all.Several of the reviews said an overseas capable power adapter (100-240V) came with the unit. That is evidently no longer the case as the unit I received (June 2010) arrived with an adapter rated at 100-120V (input) and 5V 3.6A (output). Apparently Cyberpower no longer supplies higher voltage capable power adapters with this unit. To get full simultaneous use from all the ports from a 220-240V source, you would either need to get an appropriate universal power adapter which can operate from 220-240 or a step-down transformer.From their website, Cyberpower does not appear to offer a model of this hub with a 100-240V adapter."
2,Didn't like it,"Sold them the next day I got them. Volume is low. I read in the manual something like ""Listening loud? NO! Loud music will damage your eardrums etc."" BUT I didn't like the fact that Sennheiser engineers would decide for me the maximum volume that is safe for me."
3,Did exactly what is said it would do.,This product works well....but you have to apply it daily if you want your skin/heals to stay soft. I mean if you miss a day your all dry and cracked all over again.
2,What happened ?,"When I first started reading Memory Keepers Daughter it really sucked me in and I was totally hooked. I thought this was the beginings of a great novel. But half way through the book it somehow lost the plot and I was left quite dissapointed. The second half of the book tried to go too deep and quite missed the point of looking at the parallel lives of the two children.It just seemed to drag on forever.. I feel qutie sad, the book was so good at the begining."
4,As advertised,"There is a little bit of a noise issue, but that's more a factor of my tires than anything else. Other than that its exactly what I wanted/expected."
1,doesn't work,I ordered three of these fans. Two of them made incredibly loud squeeking noises and didn't blow out any air at all. The third one worked for about a week and then died. Don't waste your money.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK IF YOU ARE A FIELD TECH,"I've been a MCSE now for about 5 years and this is the worst read I've ever had in terms of application. This book could be half the size if the author simply cut down on all the flowery explanation and potification. He simply needs to tell you why things are done and then how to do them.If you have the time at your IT job to read a college-like text book, then this book is for you. If you want to have a long drawn-out conversation each time you have a basic to advanced question about a Microsoft topic, then this book is for you.Please stay away if you are needing to get the job done and fast, but need some sound, clear, concise instruction."
2,Messy and Disappointing Kit,"I have 2 indoor cats. They are both around 7 years old. I read the instructions and installed everything just like the manual said. I read advise from other users of this product and tried my best to teach my cats to use the CitiKitty. The litter was all over my bathroom floor. What a mess! Sadly, its not for my cats. Perhaps, it might work on the younger kitties.I wouldn't say that its a waste of money since this product is not expensive so I would say ""try it and see how it works for your cat"". Never give up! But unfortunately for me, its back to the automatic ScoopFree Cat Litter box."
3,"not bad for a vampire book,","As a fanatic reader of the Vampire Chronics i'm quit disapointed by this book,anne rice love for detailfull descriptions of places is getting boring."
4,Interesting and thought provoking,"This is a book that will really make you think. The whole point of the book is to try to find where the argument that is presented in the book is wrong. Not an easy thing to do - as long as you work within the framework presented (some of the facts that are offered to support the argument are obviously wrong, but must be accepted as basic postulates - you don't have to agree with them, but whether they are right or wrong doesn't really impinge upon the thought expieriment presented). It's a form of writing that hasn't been done much recently (Think something closer to ""Plato's Republic"").One thing that should be mentioned - This is NOT a Dilbert book. It contains no humor and no cartoons. If that is what you are looking for, then pass this book.In short, if you are looking for something that will make you think try this."
4,A Reactionary Tale,"This novel was very engaging and accurate in it's depiction of the drug-addled and heady days of the 70's. The citizens of Drop City South were idealistic, naive and most of all irresponsible. Their move from California to Alaska seemed logical in the plot and ludicrous at the same time. The ability of Boyle to juxtapose these idealists with the realism of life in Alaska by real environmentalists and survivors of the Alaskan life was brilliant. By the end of the book you realize that it has levied a scathing criticism of the idealistic hippies. I found the ending disappointing and anti-climactic; but the characters were endearing and multidimensional. It was a good read and I would recommend to those looking for a glimpse into the counterculture of the 70's as well as the life of Alasakan settlers."
1,Ooooopsie!,DNA evidence actually clearly supports the Algonquin Indians as being of Middle Eastern descent.Too bad these authors either were not aware of that fact or chose to ignore it.Check out Rod Meldrum's research.
3,I thought there was more to this CD,"I was so excited about getting this CD, and when I got it, realized there were only two good songs. I should have checked into it better, but make sure you like more than two songs of this CD."
2,Luna Bar Lemon Zest New Recipe Stinks!,Luna Bar decided to change the recipe for the Lemon Zest Bars. They are way less lemony - much more oily. Very disappointed in the change - were way better before.
3,<title>,"Honestly, this is like My Side of the Mountain meets Life of Pi but more boring. I did not find out until the end of the book that the girl was once alive, but it didn't really matter. I think this book is boring partly because the author, who is a male, fails to make his character, who is a girl, sounds convincingly female. She lacks, say, some emotions. When her father dies, she barely mentions it. She doesn't even cry, I don't think. Likewise, she doesn't seem to dwell too much on her brother's dying even though he is the reason she jumps off the ship in the first place. Even though this girl is supposed to be tough, I really still can't believe she actually exists."
2,Valley 75090 Receiver Tube,"Needs to be taller. With the bike rack in place, there is not enough clearance to raise the Stowmaster 5000 tow bar high enough to clear the ball. Everytime I connect or disconnect the car, the bikes have to come off then the bike rack has to come off. I'll have a weld shop modify it for probably more than the hitch cost me but Valley should make the receiver a couple inches taller. Maybe an inch would do it -- their testing should determine."
5,Best Mario Party. Period,"I know the drill. Every Mario Party game is basically the same thing, so I'm not expecting everyone to see this game in a different light. But this game is slightly different. I think the formula is better than that of most other Mario Party games, and for the most part, I bought this so that my friends and I could add something else to our mix of Mario Kart get-togethers and whatnot and for that purpose, Mario Party 5 scores! Buy this if you and your friends need something new and interesting to do. It should keep the entertainment going for the next two months at least."
2,"The first time was okay, but the rest was horrible.",It was an extremely sad plot. See it only once. I have it and saw it at least 50 times. I feel as though I should be sick.
4,stylus,"Small, fits in pocket well, works great. no need for a large cumbersome stylus. I would reccommend to a friend. BoxWave mini Capacitive Kindle Fire Stylus (Lunar Blue)"
3,Definitely for Batman fans,"I'll just start out by saying I'm not necessarily a Batman fanatic. I love a good super hero. I love a good action movie. I like Christian Bale; Love Anne Hathaway; Love Gary Oldman; Love Michael Caine. Heck, I'm a HUGE Pittsburgh Steelers fan and actually bought the commemorative Hines Ward action figure before even seeing this movie There's a lot to like about The Dark Knight Rises. But, it just didn't do it for me. I was disappointed in Bale's performance this time around. Anne Hathaway couldn't have been any sexier. I liked Joseph Gordon-Levitt. But, this film just couldn't bring out the super hero fan in me. I thought the script was really bad. Tom Hardy's Bane was annoying. Half the time, we couldn't make out what he was saying. The action was lame. I don't know....for all the hype and how popular this film was, I'm very disappointed."
4,"An ""Outsiders"" Inside Look at Athens","While it might seem that the book could be a bit dated in light of the 8+ years that have passed since the 2004 Olympics, this book speaks volumes about the Athens of today with it sprawling landscape, political corruption, and undercurrent of racism toward the rapid inflict illegal immigrants. But being one who calls Athens ""home"", the author speaks with a sensitivity that no mere travel writer can replicate. He is not harsh in his criticism, only honest -as one might be with one's own family. Insightful & a quick, enjoyable & thought-provoking read!"
5,GREAT LIVE RECORDING,IT SHOWS A MATURING JIMI HENDRIX PLAYING MANY SONGS OTHER THAN PURPLE HAZE AND DISPLAYING NEW SOUNDS LIKE FUNK. IT IS SAD THAT JIMI NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO DISPLAY HIS MUSICAL ON A HIGH DUE TO HIS DEMISE. ENJOY THE CD!
2,not practical,"i received this for a baby gift and returned it after finding out you couldnt wash the boppy itself, and you couldnt put another cover on it, because it had to attach to the other part with loops. i just bought a boppy and placed it on another play mat"
5,Lust for Danger - Packed with Adventure!,It was hard to put the book down because I wanted to know what was going to happen next!
4,Very Scary!,"It is d*mn near impossible to scare me, but this movie temporarily crossed the threshold! A deep inside look into the spiritual realm! Laura Linney was great. A very funny part when the camera shot an eyesview of the priest running down the steps to get outside of his house! i'm smiling as i type this."
4,Imaginative with interesting illustrations,"This book is a frequently-requested bedtime read for my 2-year old. The illustrations have a lot going on so there is great opportunity for pointing out hens, trees, the teddy bear looking out the window, etc. The story is simply told yet imaginative."
5,Superb,"'The Ultimate Collection' is a superb double CD set containing many of Petra's best hits.As one of the premier bands in Christian rock history, this is a great CD for anyone to get. You can't go wrong with it. Petra's music is energetic and inspirational. They have great vocals and a terrific overall sound.They have so many great hits on this album that I won't bother to mention any specific ones. There are no bad songs here. I would consider this a must have album for any fan of contemporary Christian music or even rock and roll in general."
4,Bridesmaid Dress,Dress was exactly as described. The fit was true to size. Perfect color. The dress is just what we needed for a perfect bridesmaid dress.
5,A must read for all who carry a business card,I had never paid attention to what a business card may or may not help accomplish. Reading Dr. Grants Business Card Book allowed a new and beneficial insight. Thanks. Jehangir
4,"A fun tribute, filled with genuine love","As with most tribute albums, about half of the tracks here are people trying their best to sound like the artist...which in Harry's case is just not possible...and the rest are 'rethinkings' of the songs. It's hit-and-miss, with some wonderful performances (Ringo, Adrian Belew, Marshall Crenshaw) some inspired contributions (Victoria Williams, Randy Newman) and some real duds (Fred Schneider's ""Coconut"" is just awful). But it doesn't really matter, because everyone here genuinely loves Nilsson, and it shows."
4,the best book on the works of the famous architect K. Tange,50 yrs of Architecture and Urban Design. it's the best book concerning the life and the works of Prof. Kenzo Tange.
5,One of the top ten pop recordings of all time.,"This recording is truely brilliant, it evokes unforgetable mental imagery which I thought was impossible to produce in a recording studio. This early 1980s configuration of mindboggling african rythms combined with samples of televangelists always evokes a reaction from the listener. This is a must-listen for anyone who consideres themself a true lover of the avante-garde."
1,it's good,"Now this is how art should be done. I love that a 13 year old can do what famous artists think they can do just because hey are famous. She has as much, if not more talent than an artist educated in Paris."
5,Another great series by BBC,"When it comes to documentary series, BBC has always met and exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend it. Watch it and you are going to put life in perspective."
5,High Quality Bulbs,"In the past I have used other brands of (Extra Bright Headlights), these bulbs fit much better and the road visibility is excellent."
5,Canon deluxe gadget bag 10 EG,"This one was for me. It is perfect! All of my ""stuff"" fits. I am so excited about making some pics."
5,You MUST purchase this DVD!!,"I was skeptical when I ordered this DVD because I have had bad luck with ""beginners"" workout videos. I am so happy that I was wrong in this case. Ms. Ivanhoe is a wonderful coach and really guides beginners through each pose. I never felt pushed to the limits but I did feel energized and like I had a good workout when I was done.Using the stability ball is a great tool for doing the poses, also. Throughout my workout I kept thinking that I can't wait to do this again tomorrow. I have NEVER thought that about excercise before!!If you have never done yoga before, this is the video for you. I can't recommend it enough!"
3,"Good, in parts","Although i think Elisa is an awesome, talented singer/songwriter i have to say i was slightly disappointed with this album. I found the songs were of a reasonable standard, but the poduction let it down for me. I found that because Elisa's voice is generally too loud in all the songs, and the effort that has gone into the music is slightly lost. On her other albums, i find the vocal sits in the mix a lot better and sounds more like part of the songs. I'm probably listening to the album with rather a technical point of view, but then, that's me! That said, i'm listening to the album 'Lotus' and it's absolutely awesome! I think that Elisa is one of the most talented female singer/songwriters i've had the pleasure of listening to. Elisa fans will pretty much enjoy this album, but from a sound production point of view i feel some potentially golden moments haven't acheived their fullest potential. Anyway, i'll leave on the note that i totally LOVE her other stuff."
5,The best book about totalitariasm,"There are several books about the theme of totalitarianism, but this is one is the best. Hannah Arendt trascends all traditional concepts of ""left"" and ""righ"". You could feel the malignancy of this political pathology and understand how it works."
3,Disappointingly Short,"Negatives:1) Only two major characters involved on screen, Sheridan and Galen (Lochley is in this too, but I never cared for her character).2) Minimal sets, a la ""300""3) Almost no Disc extrasPositives:1) Very thoughtful, well written scripts.2) Great performances by Bruce Boxleitner and Peter Woodward.3) Kudos to JMS for not being afraid to deal with the supernatural in a reverent, serious way that doesn't go out of its way to mock or disparage religious belief.Bottom line: Think of this as pay-per-view for two B+ TV episodes."
4,Family and IQ produce very eccentric spy,"While much of the text speaks of baseball, spies, andunusual social behavour, the backround information tellsenough to show how all this came out of a home where thefather was not only absent but also had some ratherunusual ideas and attitudes about his own identity. If youare not overly consumed by the enlightening stories ofbaseball and spying, and pay attention to the glimpses offamily, it is facinating to see how Berg's family couldproduce such an unusual character as Moe. His use of hisintelligence makes him seem similar to today's stereotypicalgeek engineering nerd, only directed more at the humanitiesthan the technical. An easy and interesting read about avery unusual individual."
1,HEY GUYS THERE IS ANOTHER OPTION....,"Hey I almost buy this dvd.....but thanks to your reviews i did not, so instead i found a better option....you can buy the cd / dvd The Very Best of Billy Idol: Idolize Yourself (CD/DVD) [Deluxe Edition]Here the quality is INCREDIBLE.....the sound and image is fantastic....!!!! also has more and great videos!!"
1,newage sewage,"I really like Cunningham, and I really hated this book. I think it's the worst under his name.I really am not sure that this book has any use at all beyond maybe making your house smell good.It requires you to accept a number of beliefs about the power of smell with little evidence behind them...."
5,Hilarious!!,"I love this show. It is like a cross breed between Friends and Big Bang. Always funny, always a nice pick me up moment in each episode. If you haven't watched it yet then you are missing out!Digital download lets me take it anywhere and it's great to watch on plane (although people may stare at you when you are laughing to yourself)You won't be disappointed!I buy over 400 items a year from Amazon and always give an honest review in order to help those trying to make a purchase decision.This product rates 5 stars for use-ability, construction and price."
3,"Good, But a Little Sparse","This book was not at all what I had expected, in that it features a lot of superfluous personal touch that, in a story that isn't Campbell's, just doesn't belong. I wish that it had contained more statistics and factual research than just tales of his visits to Sierra Leone, with less-than-necessary intervals of fact. However, it was still an interesting read, and I definitely recommend it to someone who's seeking a general outline of the history of blood diamonds."
3,Cute but would not fit on my crib,"This mobile is very cute and plays a sweet song...I was really excited to find it. I actually got it to go with a Lambie nursery crib set from another store. However, I have a crib with a wide rail at the top (the Babi Italia Carlisle Lifetime crib) and the mobile will not fit on the side. I have seen other lifetime cribs with a similar design, so I just wanted to warn everyone that this mobile may not work. I am going to have to return it for this reason. Also, the mobile only plays for about three minutes, which is probably about average but definitely shorter than I would like."
1,Please read carefully,"I should have read the description better, it does NOT come with CD's. Plus, it's far too involved. Good perhaps if moving there but overkill for travelling."
2,Not his best,"I loved both Fight Club and Survivor. Invisible Monsters, though, pales by comparison to both of those novels. It is very difficult for men to write convincingly from the standpoint of a woman. There were many points in the book when it was blatantly obvious that the author was a man and didn't quite understand what it's like to be a woman. (A woman would probably not think about her breasts being hard when she was holding a frozen turkey against them.) The plot was driven by bizarre turns of fate that, though interesting, seem forced. The only truly brilliant writing in the novel revolves around the protagonist's parents. I've read few other things that equal the genius of the Christmas chapter. Unfortunately, that chapter cannot make up for the rest of the novel."
4,Gerber Diesel rating,Nice product.However you may want to checkout the Gerber Suspension Multiplier as an alternative buy
5,"Great acting, who-dunn-it keeps you guessing","What a great movie! I remember watching it as a kid and had to see it again! Just gets better with time! All star cast with such theatrical acting! If you've never seen the movie before, you'd never guess who dunn it! They just don't make movies like this today. This stimulates the mind without all the gore. Very comical, too. Highly recommended."
1,did not fit,i have always had a problem getting a 32 c . i was so happy to find them in my size. when it got here i was about two sizes two big. just one more reason companys should use the same size scale.i was happy that it was so easy to return andthen the credited my account pretty fast.
4,Surprisingly Good,"Faith Hill has never disappointed me with any of her albums. Though not as good as her latest effort Cry, it is much better than her most popular album, Breathe. This CD has her most notable hits of the late '90s - This Kiss, Let Me Let Go, The Secret Of Life and Just To Hear You Say That You Love Me, a duet with her hubby Tim McGraw. One of my favorites is Love Ain't Like That but, unfortunately, it failed at radio back in early '99. And unlike most country albums of the '90s, the unreleased songs aren't filler. In fact, my very faves are Better Days, My Wild Frontier and I Love You - all unreleased songs. Surprisingly, Faith's version of I Love You is much better than the original Celine Dion version. After Cry and It Matters To Me, Faith is my favorite album by the beautiful and talented Faith Hill."
3,Not as good as the movie,"I liked this book, but I liked the movie better and that doesn't happen a lot. Great story and interesting characters."
1,Exceptionally Poor Quality Reproduction,"The 1968 BBC performance of ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" was terrific. Unfortunately, as others have noted by others here, the quality of this reproduction of that performance is abysmal. Absolutely abysmal. THe color is uneven and faded, and the sound uneven as well. It is most unfortunate that this fine production by a sterling cast should be so degraded in this edition. This is a movie which really is in want and need of a proper treatment.This version is not such a treatment."
5,The beggining of a new generation of technology!,"I, in fact happen to own an Amazon kindle. On Tuesday, I bought a book and started reading it. I was very impressed on this new 'ebook'.The price: At first, you might say,"" $400??!! Im not paying that much for the kindle!""But just consider, in a year, you will probably have bought about 20 books or more. Say each book is about $15. You would have spent about $300 on books in a year. The Amazon kindle can store 200 books at a time! Can you carry 200 books on an air plane or train? Now you can! Imagine: your whole library traveling with you.The Amazon kindle is definitely worth the money!"
2,Copy of a book,"Contrary to to the description title this is not a reprint, this is a photo copy of the original book. Much of the book is hard to read due to blurred or faded letters and pictures. I can't tell you how good of a read the book is as the print quality caused me to have to quit reading it shortly after I started reading it. The blurred pictures made it impossible to follow the text in the included figures. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS COPY OF A BOOK!"
1,Pure Trash,"This guy is so full of himself it's sick. He makes stuff up just to get more people to see his pieces of crap so he can buy more Big Macs and stuff them down his lying mouth. The day this guy is ""silenced"" the better."
4,Great!,"Book arrived as promised, practically new with only slight evidence of previous use. Very pleased with this item!"
4,Very Good Condition,This book was in the condition as stated. It was definitelt worth what I paid for it. Thank you very much.
1,Fritz the Cat,The package was broken... Nothing good. I can't see the movies. Please take care with the international post. Some other providers use little boxes with a plastic cushion to avoid damages.Thanks
3,Assembly not easy,"Someone said it took HER 15 min w/help of her 2 year old son and should take anyone else 10 minutes. Not so. We are experienced toy ""putter-togetherers"" and it was an hour. There's no way I'd be able to do it all by myself because it required a lot of strength to try and stretch the springs into place. My husband could barely do it and he's not some girly type either. He works out regularly and isn't small."
4,true blood the first season,I watched the second season and wanted to know how it all started? I find the series very intriging. It is wierd but makes you want to watch more of it.
2,Not very useful,There's not much in this video by way of direct instructions and demonstration of the technique. Just a mishmash collection of excepts from his workshops. Not good enough value for money.
4,It is very difficult to put any of the novels in this series,Another excellent Hornblower adventure that I thoroughly enjoyed.
1,Do not buy!,I bought this device because in the past we had a 9Volt that was really good. This device is not worth the price. I have had several different ones. This one runs at half the speed of the others. Even with a new battery. I would give it a negative if I could. Very disappointed.
5,Brave,"Great movie! I look forward to watching it again. Great storyline and message for children of all ages...be careful of what you wish for, you might get it. Also, girls need to talent, smart, strong and brave, so they can have a say in who their life partner may be. I will be watching it again."
1,"20 by Harrick Connick, Jr.","This was a TERRIBLE cd. I bought it for my husband's birthday. It sounded like a 7-year-old beginning pianist was playing piano, and the singing wasn't much better. I am extremely disappointed in this purchase."
4,Great new sleuth,"Jennifer Apodaca's novel DATING CAN BE MURDER introduces a clever heroine named Samantha Shaw who after her husband's sudden death makes some ""enhancements"" to her life. What is soon to follow is a series of sometimes frightening, but hilarious events that takes the reader on an exciting roller coaster ride. DATING is a fun read with colorful characters and enough action, mystery, and romance for everyone. We'll be seeing much from Jennifer Apodaca."
1,Very Dissappointed,"I am a builder who was looking for ideas on cottage decore for sea shore homes. This book would be more aptly titled ""Modern Architecture by the Sea"". The homes featured in this book had nothing to do with most peoples' preconceived ideas of what a ""cottage"" looks like. I am returning the book for a refund."
4,Nerds in Paradise Soundtrack?,"Does anyone know if there is an existing ""Nerds in Paradise"" soundtrack? I am actually searching for the last song that plays during the credits. I can't seem to find it, or any information on the soundtrack anywhere. CAN SOMEBODY HELP ME??? I'd really like to know the name of that last song! Nerdtacular!"
5,A Rave,Just love it! It is convenient to use especially when the weather is inclement and outside walking not possible.
5,Marvelous,I am a medical transcriptionist for a large company and this book was a lifesaver. Stedman's you rock!! Will buy again.
2,"distracting, but not really good","Other reviewers have eloquently described this book. And it is not unpleasant reading--it is distracting and mildly entertaining. It won't keep you up all night finishing it.I just want to re-iterate that the acquisition of limitless wealth, the change of identity and appearance, and the various revenges taken, strain the credibility way too far. The last part of the book is all juvenile fantasy wish fulfillment, and made me uncomfortably embarrassed for the author, who I have to presume took the fantasy wishes from his own collection. Sure, we all have these fantasies, but if I'm going to read about someone else's, I'd like them described a little more artfully."
5,Brilliant - Elvis keeps getting better!,"Firstly, don't let the DVD Region 1 status put you off - I am in Australia and this disc played perfectly on my PC, DVD Player and even the PS2! It's wonderful to finally see an intimate performance by Elvis Costello on DVD! It brought so many memories of his tour in 2004 back to me. Elvis Fans will love this DVD featuring his latest music, along with many oldies, it is very rare to get up close and personal with this man! Elvis gives 100% of himself on stage! A must for your music DVD collection."
4,once twice three times overlooked,"we all heard the ballads like forever cause the ballads lionel richie performed will never die, brick house tired of that i like this because of the way forgotten funk the commodores made before lionel started shopping at hallmark, like are you happy a classic, cebu that is the bomb, why is that never mentioned? if you wanna hear the ballads then this is fopr you, but if you wanna hear a different side of the commodores then check it out, you might be like is this lionel."
2,The Wrong Shape,"Reading all the reviews of this breadmaker made me think it would be the machine I wanted. I used my old bread machine at least every other day for almost 10 years. Unfortunately, when I got the Sunbeam, I discovered something you can only find out in person. The loaf pan is an odd shape. I can't see how you could use it to make bread for sandwiches. The slices of bread would be too large. Also, any bread I made in it wouldn't fit into my storage containers. The loaf pan seemed too narrow for horizontal loaves, but not narrow enough for vertical loaves. I think this would be a great bread machine if you're not trying to make all your everyday bread with it, like I do. I'm going to have to start all over looking for a new bread machine, one that will bake the right shaped loaves."
2,Not Kind to Women,"SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER was a very popular ""R"" rated film with young audiences made in 1977. It featured John Travolta as Tony Manero who lived in Brooklyn and spent his weekends at a local disco with his buddies. It was very popular at the time and reflected the time and place somewhat accurately but was criticized for its use of foul language and its depiction of young women as sex objects. Even though the film was realistic in part it was giving the wrong message to all the young people indicating that certain types of amoral behavior was a reality and was acceptable. For that reason the film was re-edited and reissued in an alternate ""PG"" rated version."
4,Nice Phone,Pros:Really cool phone. Nice OS with amazing tabbed display option.Battery is not bad if not great.I changed the packet option to 'when needed' from 'always' which helps the batteryNice music playerCons:OS is a bit slow. Response sometimes a but sluggish.had some issues with real player files not workingagain as i said battery is not great... dont xpect 3 days widout charging...
4,Beware of matching Prairie rugs!,"I ordered the gold runner a month ago, was happy and decided to added a 2x3 gold for the same room. To my surprise the two shades of gold don't at all match! The runner was a lighter gold, but the 2x3 turned out to be decidedly darker and browner. Apparently there's a ""no return policy"" on this item! I'm shocked. Both rugs are good quality, but a buyer should know that there's no guarantee shades will match. Now I'm stuck with a nice little rug that I'll have to find another use for."
3,This movey made me feel rill smart an' stuff,"Muh gurlfrend n I wur gon watch king of thuh hill, buhht then we sed lets go t'thuh vidio storr? We took this 'un, an' we feel reel smart an' all that bcuz we watcht it. If I gon to skool 'sted of bein tot at hom thun mabuh I'd unnerstan whut this moveys 'bout. Hunny, whurrd yu put thuh pork rines?"
4,(Review on any Tenchi TV),"I loved the Tenchi cartoons it was half DragonBall Z half Staw Warz.I loved Tenchi Muyo,Universe and Tokyo.It is about(If i remember right,i last seen it in 2002) a teenage lad who goes running and finds a cave and finds a magic sword(Think Light Sabre from Star Warz,Its exactly like one of those) and is grabbed into a world of extraordinary stuff he encounters a woman who later has a crush on him and she attacts him and he fight her with that Light Sabre like sword.Thats what i can only remember.I seen it on CartoonNetwork and C.N.X.(UK chanels).Though it was alot like Star Warz it was nearly as good as DBZ.Great cartoon to NE body who likes Str Wrz or DragonBall-Z"
5,Really Great Knife,I got this knife for my college roommate's wedding gift. It was a really nice knife. A friend of mine recommended Buck and I can see why. This knife was really great and appeared to be built very well. The handle of the knife I bought was a little lighter than the picture and the sheath is a very light tan. It is a very beautiful knife. I would recommend it.
1,What a piece of junk,"Went straight from the box to the recycling bin since it was now too mangled to return. Nothing fit together properly so I had to resort to taping the plastic parts inorder to get them to hold their configuration long enough to line up with the base. Then the cage bars wouldn't slide into the plastic. I gave up and bought a Crittertrail system which went together like magic. The Habitrail system, however, is made of very thin plastic and is poorly engineered. I'll never buy another product from this line."
3,"""Rough Diamond,"" yeah!","I have to agree with reviewer Bridges above, this is probably my favorite Heep album, too. But to whoever the other reviwer, that said that ""Wetton wasn't as good as Thain?"" Well...go back and check some of your album covers and see how many John Wetton's been on (or in the case of ""Asia,"" inflicted on) Anyway, ""Fantasy"" is almost literally that. The band sounds like they're finally coming into their own as a ""prog"" band instead of the braindead/headbanger mentality that finally ended with ""Sweet Freedom."" But the best track on the album? No question: #2, ""Shady Lady."" Any song, stupid as the lyrics are, that features a Ken Hensley slide guitar and a Mick Box ""lead"" guitar has to be great. Oh yeah, another plus: ""Fantasy"" doen't have any hobbity Ken Hensley liner notes either. Sorry if he don't like the album."
1,skip it...,This movie really really sucks... Don't waste your time!!! Nothing like Dead Man Walking.
2,Old information,"This is a good book idea, and it might have been a good book in its day, but it's an old book with dated information, I discovered."
5,Nice mouse,"I bought my Wheel Mouse about a year ago. This is probably the best mouse you can get at a good price. Its like a Microsoft Intellimouse and a Microsoft Basic Mouse combined into one, keeping the Intellimouse Wheel and the Basic Mouse shape and feel."
5,Pleased for different reasons,The book was in very good condition. It is also very easy to read. I bought this book because my Grand-daughter has gotten into geneology and has asked about family history. Dr. Fisher is my great-great uncle so it gave her a thrill to read about a famous relation especially when she found out through research that he was married to the also famous American Indian Princess Te Ata. The book was worth far more than I paid for it just for the pleasure and dreams it gave a young girl.
2,No writing at all,"This book tries very hard to come up with ""stories"" to fill the gap of those years we had previously read and saw in the movies...but it becomes more a event list than a fiction.Disappointed."
3,"Interesting book, not much new...","I enjoyed this book a little bit, but I found that for significantly long sections that the author either deviated into niches of his research too narrow to contribute to his ultimate objective. Between that distraction and the fact that there's just so much in here that's either not new or too obvious, I decided to rate it a 3. This book was by no means revolutionary or life changing for me as some of the reviews seem to indicate, but to each his own."
2,Tons of mistakes and grammatical errors,Not nearly as good as ICRC. I agree with the other reviewer that there seems to have been no editor.
1,Not the complete album.,"Why does your MP3 version only have nine tracks?? The original has 12, as does the one sold on iTunes. I'm not buying it unless I can get the complete album. Furthermore, you don't even list it as a partial album."
1,Business Book?,This book does not belong among business books. Really quite silly. Won't do a thing to improve your business. Look around - there really are research based books out there.
3,picture wrong,The picture and description at time I ordered said green coffee extract. I got green tea extract that's why the 3 stars. I use green tea but was set on the green coffee extract.
4,A Case of Mistaken Identity,"When Flash/Flash was released, ""Small Beginnings"" and ""Children of the Universe"" received major airplay from prog-rock stations. At the time, the style was to play long segues, with almost no announcments. Most people never heard the artists credits... and with two alumni from ""Yes"", Peter Banks (guitar) and Tony Kaye (keyboards)... people ran out and bought ""The Yes Album"" and missed the band ""Flash"" completely. What a shame. This album really shows their talents, but the market just wasn't there for them. The songs on this album are great."
5,Awesome teaching tool,"I use this to teach civil disobedience and the importance of Gandhi because it is part of our 7th grade curriculum. It is such a good movie. It is one of my favorite things to teach each year because the movie was made so well, shows so many important events throughout Gandhi's life, and the kids always love it. I recommend watching it for pleasure as well."
2,the animals and whoom?,"This is a mix of The animals,and Eric Burton and the new animals.The new animals,someone sings half of theese songs in a deep abnoctios voice which sounds like crap on background vocals as well,which almost ruins the songs."
4,Pretty Awesome,"The title is sort of a lie, it's more than just starting conversations, it has plenty of great ideas for conversation in general, if you're a bit shy or just not comfortable talking to people you don't know, this book is awesome."
2,Not the greatest... for me.,"I was looking for this binder to really help organize me and I didn't feel like it did so much. It is just a binder with some pockets in it, but it didn't give me any ideas on how to organize. If you're one to go through magazines and do a lot of clipping and searching of pictures, this binder might be great, but I already had a good idea of what I wanted so I didn't do all of that. I had a good idea of what I wanted, i just needed help organizing everything."
1,do not buy i repeat do not buy!!!!!!!!!,this item sucks i got it when i lost the regular one and i put it on the psp but i kept getting stuck up top and i kept having to pause the game take the stick of move it around then put the stick back on every five seconds its hard to use its terrable moving gets me killed playing shooting games online so now i wasted my money and i just have to go with that little nub that holds the stick it hurts my thumb and i cant play games for very long because it hurts so much im getting way less use out of my psp because of it dont buy these get something else
2,OK,The book was not that bad-but i wouldn't strongly recommend it. It was a bit weird for my liking.
1,Dont waste your money,"""Santa"" bought one from a mall kiosk. Paid $29.95 + tax for a piece of junk that never lifted off of the floor. Would love to know who manufactured this product. Not looking to get my money back (I'm a realist), but so a 7-yr old can vent his feelings towards one of Santa's elves."
3,not what i had hoped for,"I don`t think this is such a great book. Yeah, ok, funny gorilla takes the keys and lets the animals out..... There are hardly any words in the book and my daughter like it either. sorry, not a fan."
2,"awesome, but deadly",This mug has EVERYTHING I want in a travel mug. It seals tight to prevent leakage (even when upside down). It fits in my car cup holder. It keeps beverages hot/ cold for a very long time. It is so cool. Except when you find out there are IMPOSSIBLE to clean places. Nothing is worse than pouring a new cup of coffee only to have it smell like rotten soy milk.... ewww! Rotten smelly travel mug = bad. The lid has nooks that are impossible to reach or clean and it can not be taken apart. It's unfortunate because I really like this travel mug. Boohoo.
2,Big disappointment for a Parker fan!,"I'm sorry, but this is the worst Robert B. Parker novel I have ever read! I am sorry that I spent the money on the paperback. I loved the Spenser novels, I even loved Night Passage with Jesse Stone, but this book was pedestrian, right from the start. The dialogue was so predictable, I could practically guess what Sunny was going to say. The characters were underdeveloped with no real depth. There was no thrill or excitement at the end of the book, like in the rest of Mr. Parker's novels. All I know is that I will be getting the next book he writes from the library!"
4,good book,What can anybody say about Samuel Clemens. His books and short stories are always entertaining and fun to read anytime.
4,A great toy for solar system fans,"My son is 5 and obsessed with the solar system. This toy is probably designed for older kids, but if you have an advanced preschooler or kindergartener, they will also enjoy it and it's a toy they can grow into. All in all, a good buy."
5,Starship Troopers - A Hit,"Roughnecks is the best show period. The animation is spectacular and the story has a very grasping plot. The Roughnecks (led by Lieutenant Razak) fight space bugs which have invaded our solar system (sounds corny, but its really not). From fighting on Pluto to the outer brinks of many galaxies, Starship Troopers adds drama, suspense and humor all in one show (with amazing animation).If anyone (especially sci-fi lovers) hasn't seen the Roughnecks, they're really missing out on one of the greatest television shows ever created.""Live forever apes!"""
4,Go at your own pace.,"Even those of us who love to get lost in a good, long read, often appreciate the short story as a change of pace. I felt as if I too were journeying through London on the Tube, peeking into the lives of my fellow (or should I say ""sister"" ) commuters. This book is for everyone who ever sat bored on a train, imagining storylines for everyone sitting nearby!"
3,It was funny for 10 pages,"After the first 10 pages or so, the joke got old.OK, I get that it's a parody, but a parody can only go so far. Once you recognize that by Clements' exaggerating Dan Brown's hyperbolic writing just a little you realize what a bad writer - albeit great story-teller (not the same thing)- Brown truly is, ""The Asti Spumante Code"" gets very old very quickly.I would only recommend the book with the caveat that it's silly."
2,Umm...not for me.,"I really had to force myself to read this one, thinking, maybe it will get better. Unfortunately it didn't. I really enjoy parnormal romance/urban fantasy books. But, this one was just not believable. It really was silly and the characters were 2 dimensional at best. If you like your reads more on the fluff side (as this one is)try the Undead series by Maryjanice Davidson."
2,"Waxy, sorta cheap","I guess the price was ok for the quality... but the product wasn't great... didn't do what it was supposed to do. However, it is an excellent mosturizer, if you don't mind the greasiness."
4,Loved it,Great book for children! I read this book to my nephew and he loved it! He made me read it over and over.
5,Great title but WAY cheaper elsewhere!,I got this at BJ's brand new for $19.99Sorry Amazon...price check register 3!
3,not that tight,"i expected this $hit to be tight as hell""breakin da law"" is alot bettathey got 1 song from breakin da law on here and thats tire shopget breakin da law its real rare and i got it if u wanna trade music hit ah ni99ah up at hearless_murderah_187@yahoo.com"
1,Misleading CD,"As the other reviewers have stated, you get an actual copy of ""Whoever's in New England"" and ""Sweet 16"". I didn't read the reviews first and therefore didn't realize the ruse until I received the product! If you're really jonesed to get those two CD's then it's a good deal, but get it ""used""...much cheaper. I paid .65 each...as the old saying goes, ""if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is."" As was the case here."
3,UNUSUAL SEXUAL BEHAVIORS,"Robert J. Stoller, MDPerversion:The Erotic Form of Hatred(New York: Pantheon, 1975)(reprint: London, UK: Karnac Books, 1986) 240 pagesStoller takes another look at several unusual sexual behaviors(homosexuality, cross-dressing, transsexualism, pornography),but he does not successfully formulate a comprehensive theory.Childhood trauma, resulting in hostility and hatred, probably explainsonly some of the unusual sex-scripts touched on in this book.Some historical beginnings of exploration into imprinted sex-scripts.Search the Internet for other books:""VARIATIONS OF SEX & GENDER BIBLIOGRAPHY"".James Leonard Park, author ofVariations of Sex & Gender:Six Phenomena Frequently Confused."
5,"Fabulous, and the animals actually enjoy it!","Our family includes six dogs ranging from a Chihuahua to a Doberman (two of them, a collie and a labrador retriever, have long coats) plus one (very wary) cat. I purchased this product after reading an enthusiastic review of it in a glossy dog-enthusiast magazine; the price at amazon.com was far less than half the price for the same item in the leading mail order pet products catalog. Not only does Furminator work as represented, extracting huge fluffy clouds of fur, especially from the dogs with long coats; the animals, even the cat, also seem to enjoy the grooming and happily remain passive and relaxed until I've been thoroughly over them. This one's a winner!"
2,Belgian Greyhound pet comb is the only one to get,"I have tried many pet combs for grooming my long-haired cat. Cheap ones (like this one) aren't worth the money. The teeth bend and break easily--take a close look at the photo of this brand new one for an example. But the worst part is that they just don't work well. Do a bit of searching and you will find an expensive ($20+) Greyhound comb that is FAR superior and will last you a lifetime. You want only the original one made in Belgium. Talk to any professional groomer, they will all tell you the same thing. Unfortunately, this Belgian made comb is not available in typical retail pet outlets because most people refuse to shell out over $20 for just a comb. Also, look out for imitations. You do not want a Greyhound ""style"" comb, you want only the real thing. Good luck in your search. Your cat will love you for it!"
4,To whom it may concern,"This is an overall great prodouct, but, it seems to delete data when trying to hold an EA Sports file like: Madden 2002, All Star Baseball, etc. I recommend that if you only play sports games with ESPN or a year like 2002 in the title, this would not be a good product for you to buy."
1,This item ....... WAS NOT NEW.,This item was....... NOT NEW.It has been USED then returned.THERE IS EVEN SOMEONES DIRT IN THE HALF FILLED VACUUM CLEANER BAG......THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE That someone would use a item then return it. And even more UNBELIEVABLE that Amazon would ship out a returned item with out checking it out firstI am so pissed right now.
1,Not as pictured.,"The item was not as pictured. I could not use the item, but it cost more to return than I paid. I would not order from this vendor again."
2,Serious proofreading lacking,"Crimes of the RightHer novels are well plotted but seriouslyflawed by scores of typos, misspellings anderrors in diction and grammar. I stopped counting these at 100"
3,Seagal / Daemon = Action / Comedy / Buddy Movie,"This is by far one of the better movies that Seagal has been in, he even shows that he can act a little and there is comedy from Seagal's sidekick Daemon Wayans. This is a stereotypical buddy / action movie, with lots of explosions, fight scenes and 8 people going through windows. Even though it is a buddy movie, all of the time is spent on Seagal's character who is the Glimmer man, a detective who is a former killer who found peace and spirituality. If it sounds corny, it is the joke of the entire movie but Seagal gets the last laugh as usual beating up bad guys, doing comedy and throwing a few philosophical lines at the audience. Its not a bad movie, and it has a great running time of 92 minutes, because the action does get repetitive, especially the final fight scene, as the same kick is used a good 25 times against Seagal."
2,Soft-core java for weekend programmers,"Don't believe the cover. This book is not useful for professional programmers. I hadn't really used Java since JDK 1.02, and thought this book could get me up to speed. Now it just collects dust and occassionally gets further defaced when I'm feeling spiteful.It probably would be good for somebody learning Java from Visual Basic -- it includes lots of VB-specific notes. But if you already know anything about Java or OO you will find this book very slow and hard to use. It makes a terrible reference as its description of both the language and the libraries are far from complete, hoping that you can infer the general ideas from their simple over-explained examples. Serious programmers will be bored or even insulted by the windy, condescending prose.Keep looking. There's got to be better out there. I wish I had."
4,4.25 stars- Brymer's best account of the concerto,"Of Brymer's three different versions of the Clarinet Concerto, his phrasing seems to be the best in this particular version. I think the timing of the slow movement at about 7:15 is going a little fast (I like versions to be at about the 8:00 minute mark), but it's not breathlessly fast in the least. This is a recording made in 1964 but it's not bad, just a little dry. If you just want a good Clarinet Concerto you really can't go wrong with this version.Also, the Clarinet Quintet is even better than the concerto and it's seems to have a little better sound quality too. If it's not the best recorded quintet available it's in the top 5 percent of all available recordings of that work. You definitely won't feel shortchanged if you buy this superb cd."
2,Damaged paper on arrival,"Box of paper arrived damaged and heavily taped up... inside, 3 reams of paper were damaged and taped up, apparently previously opened. Would not order again."
2,you can do better,Minus:These were some of the most uncomfortable headphones I've ever worn.There is a hum/buzz sound when noise canceling is turned on.One of the hinges broke about a year after purchased them.Plus:The folded up very nicely when I tossed them in the waste bucket.
4,Good Value,"The unit works well... The infrared night light is a real plus. The infrared light surprised me as far as distance and uniform lighting. The unit is compact, and easy to use.The best feature for me is the wide field of view."
3,The Sound and the Fury Review,"reasonably timed delivery, didnt know just how used the product really was (not that i care, it just would have been nice to know about all the mark-ups)"
2,Disappointing,"I had high hopes for this player as I have had multiple components from Onkyo in the past (including DVD players) and they have all been really solid.This unit, however, has been nothing but a dud. For a unit of its price and supposed pedigree, it is extremely finicky when it comes to reading DVDs. Too often I insert a disc, wait 30 seconds, and get ""Bad Disc"" on the menu. But when I take that same DVD to my Mac, it works just fine. Error correction is extremely poor - discs that read just fine on other players either stop or skip on this player.Just last night, my wife and I were watching a movie on this unit. Our daughter woke up, so we stopped the movie. 10 minutes later when I tried to restart the movie, the Onkyo told me it was now a ""bad disc"".Forget it. I'm finding another player."
1,incompetent uploader,"I am currently trying to return this book for a refund. The text is very good, but the person who uploaded it is incompetent. The book was obviously scanned from a dtb. that is fine but the scanning errors were not corrected. The big problem is that when you upload a book to Amazon, you must download it, correct the HTML, and then reupload it. This was not done. The result is a book where the paragraphs are not indented. The text of this book is good enough that I would live with that if it were a free or inexpensive book but at just under $15 that is intolerable.John BeyerleinLiz & Dick"
4,Good Game -a little tough for the younger ages,"Overall this game is fun and was a good buy. I do not want to rehash what the other reviewers have written, they are pretty much right on with their assessment. But I do have to say, this game is a little too much for younger kids. My little guy (age 4) loves the nintendo characters and he can handle most platform based games, so I picked him up this game based on the reviews I read, not realizing that the game has a RPG aspect to it. I actually thought I had bought him something else, but decided to give the game a chance based on the reviews. There are too many breaks in the action and too much reading involved to hold the younger audience."
2,don't be fooled by this janet jackson wannabe,"so she had 2 dance hits, but she can't even dance as good as janet jackson yet she copies her videos and dance moves and all these little kids are falling for it. What a damn shame."
1,what order?,"This order was a joke ... I ordered the magazine over a month ago, was charged for it immediately, but haven't received the magazine, a card, nothing!Would I order again? Are you kidding?!?!"
5,Excellent as always,"This movie is probably the most true to the story as anything ever done. That is saying a lot when one considers how many copies of this story is out there. The characters actually quote parts of the book. Of course the typical cynical muppets humor is there. Gonzo says, "" I knew that because I am the narrator. I am omni present"". That is just one example amon many they work in."
2,good for adult reggae lovers,"After the huge success of Boombastic, I thought Shaggy would expand on that success. This album, to me, has a totally different sound than Boombastic. The best tracks on the album are probably John Doe, the Peice of My Heart remix, and I guess Tender Love is okay too. But even these sound way too popish. They sound like they were made for some adults. It's totally not dancehall but more like Pop/rock and lovers rock. Don't get me wrong, I love Shaggy, but I think this doesn't help his potential. If it wasn't for That Girl, which wasn't even his song, he'd be a one hit wonder in America. I think Shaggy sounds best when he's exploring more true dancehall and reggae, and he's at his best when he does hip-hop and r&b. This album was a disappointment and I'd only recommend it for adults over thirty five."
5,UNBELIEVABLE!!!,"As a vocalist myself, I can say with all honesty and fairness that Ms. McPhee has one of the best voices I have ever heard. She has GREAT tone quality and strong vocals and there is no dobut that she will go on to do AMAZING things!! This single is a MUST BUY!!!!"
3,What a business,"A quick, entertaining memoir of Jimmy Wagner's short and adreneline soaked career as a New York PI. Famous people, good and bad, populate this fast paced tale."
2,Good for a While then real bad,"At first it was great. It was cheaper than a regular controller, but now I see why. Sometimes it works okay and sometimes it will move your person by itself. No good at all."
2,An overpriced Harlequin Romance,"If you like stories like this, you can get them for around [price] at the supermarket checkout. Except for the fact that it was published in hardcover, this book has no discernible differences from the pulp romance genre. A young 23 year old woman, engaged to be married, undergoes a life-altering transition when her young, dashing fiancee becomes paralyzed! She escapes her contrained life by fleeing to New York and taking another lover--she also pursues her dream of becoming a fashion designer.. . .the sex scenes (frequent) are hilarious--full of euphemisms like ""he pressed 'himself' into her""--also reminiscent of the Harlequin romance-genre. As a bland, predictable romance--it's okay. But to somehow claim that this book approaches ""good literature"" is just plain wrong. If you're in the mood for this kind of book--toss it in the shopping cart with the milk and eggs."
5,Encountering the New Testament/ A Super Study Tool,I found this book a very good resource in my study. I would highly recomend it to anyone who wants to understand the New Testament better!
4,Nice strainer,"This strainer looks nice and has a solid feel. I expect it to last a very long time. If you're looking for an ordinary hand-held strainer, this is a fine choice. Perhaps it would be nice if the handle were lighter so that the mesh could sit on a pot without having to be held in place; you'll need a separate strainer to do that. But for most purposes, this is excellent."
5,great read'n for a drug store cowboy,"i have seven full volumes of ""louie"" and found a list of his bantam books. all of them are worth the time and price."
4,Handy & Reliable,"This mini dictionary is easily placed in a backpack, satchel, or briefcase and is a handy reference for those times when you are not so sure of spelling or usage. I love it!"
4,Good with a twist ending.,"This book was semi-good and it also had a twist ending. Not one of the best books I've ever read, but it was still pretty good. The book kind of stayed on a subtle level."
1,missing screws,my bright starts tropical fun around we go activity station arrived WITHOUT screws. I am going to buy screws at the hardware store or return it.

5,GREAT SAW!!,"I love milwaukee products,they have been good to me over the years.This saw works great just like I expected!! THANKS FOR GREAT PRODUCTS MILWAUKEE!!!!!"
1,Poor Quality,"This toy is cute, however, the quality is so poor that I wouldn't recommend it. The pieces of the castle do not stay together."
5,Great piggy bank.,"I bought this piggy bank for a grandson to help him learn to save money. It is very durable and made a great gift, especially since it was given with some money already in it."
1,totally unrealistic,Why would it go up from under $100 to 300? It is silly to think I'd pay that much for a collection which originally sold for $99. Price went up that much in 3 years? stupidEven dumber its now up to $600+.
5,A great film,"This film is simply spectacular, while it's a bit broken down to fit onto film it pretty much sums up the story of the American dream and the powers that want to destroy it. For auto enthusiasts and a general audience this film will show exactly how Corporate America has slowed the advancement of technology ensuring we fall behind while other countries advance. Jeff Bridges' performance is fantastic and his supporting cast is great as well. The elder Bridges does a great job of playing the ""evil"" senator. I highly recommend this film to anyone who is interested in automobiles or just wants to learn a little bit of American history."
5,Awesome DVD and CD,"""Spirit"" by Peter Buffet is a spiritual expirience that you will never forget. Originally a stage show, it was brought to film and now has captured a NAMMT Award for best ""Native Heart "" at the Native American Music Awards this past Saturday. The music takes you on a journey visually and musically exploring what happens when technology takes over our lives and parallels the Native American simple way of living simultaneously through various image, music, and dance. All mediums of music are used, Native American,jazz, blues, PowWow, New Age,and ballet dance,erc. Your emotions will be all over the map, you laugh, cry, experience joy. The spiritual journey is worth every bit of the price of the DVD and I bought the CD as well so I could listen to the music only over and over. 5 star album fabulous!"
3,I Think This One's OK,"This is my second JVC camcorder, and it isn't bad at all. I haven't had it for very long, but it was pretty easy to use. It is not feature-rich, but it has enough to keep me occupied. I am a beginner camcorder user, and I was shooting and playing tapes back with ease very quickly. The focusing isn't great, but on the upside, it does pretty well in darker environments. I was shooting in dim conditions and the picture was nice and clear. The sound is OK too. Playback was alright, but somewhat grainy. The appearance of the camera isn't all that sleek, but all in all it is a reliable, easy to use model."
5,Amazing!,"This ladder, while not cheap, paid for itself the first day I used it. We are doing interior painting and finishing. The ladder is very sturdy, and has deep-enough steps that I can stand comfortably. Not having to move a ladder every 20 minutes is great! And, although the ladder is marked not to stand on the top surface, the top is actually a double wide platform that lets me reach our higher ceilings.Put it in the corner of a room, and be able to reach your armspan along one wall and then three feet plus your armspan on the other wall! What's not to like about that??It does fold, but it still is going to be a challenge to store, since it ends up being 3 feet x 4 feet x 12 inches or so."
1,Pure Industrial Chemical - Toxic MSG -,"For anyone who suffers from adverse reactions to Monosodium Glutamate (MSG) this should be avoided. MSG is the main ingredient. For me causes Migrane headache within 30 minutes - thats for all MSG containing foods, not just this."
2,not a good value,"I bought this game thinking it would be a fun racing game...i spent [money]! u can race and gain points on a different section by causing crashes the crashs are really lame because random cars accedently hit other cars that has nothing to do with the crash, anyways its not worth the money rent it before you buy it, trust me."
2,BAD DESCRIPTION>>>THIS IS ONLY FOR REAR WINDOWS,"The order arrived in a huge box, with only two pieces of rear window deflectors.Dissapointing. Had it been mentioned that it is only for rear window, i would ordered accordingly. I expected it to be a set of our, two for front and two for rear windows."
5,Game Fan,"We played this game over the Thanksgiving holiday with family members ranging in age from 7 to 60. We had two teamswith as few as 3 people on a team to sometimes as many as 7 per team. It was a blast. When the words were too hard for the youngest we just quickly passed the disk to the next one on our team, or someone on the other team gave them a quick clue as to what the word was. We couldn't get enough of the game. It makes you think fast and learn some things about those around you as they throw clues at you. Our son's girlfriend who is 17 always got the words that had to do with reproduction. It was a riot. I would highly recommend this one."
3,It was ok,Got some laughs out of me but the story line was terrible. Rent it if there is noting else good out.
1,Dont buy from eek Technology,"you can find a better price , and its only replacement remote starter, it took them 3 weeks to send the item"
1,good pictures of nature but little advise,"This book looks beutiful, its a very lovely ornament for the table, but as fore advice and ionformation - it was very dull, and appart from 2-3 gardens, most was just beutiful nature or flower pictures. i was very disapointedMichal"
2,keep shopping if you have opposable thumbs,"It's great that you won't burn yourself when you pick up a heavy, hot pan. But suddenly, unable to keep a natural grip, you will drop the pot on your foot and break a bone or 20 (the human foot has many bones).My son, who is otherwise a great person, bought me this mitt. I will return it because it is so hard to use. It forces my thumb into an unnatural position which is not conducive to grasping, let alone lifting. I have it in mind to give him a stern talking-to."
3,not as entertaining,"My seven month old son loves the ""Baby Mozart"" video. I thought for sure ""Baby Santa's Music Box"" would entertain him. I was surprised to find that ""Baby Santa's Music Box"" barely held his attention while the ""Baby Mozart"" video holds his attention the entire 27+ minutes. I found the characters adorable, but they didn't pass the test for my son!"
4,Some great stuff,"A great album from EJ. And almost every song has something of interest on it, whether it be Jean-Luc Ponty's electric violin solo on ""Mellow"", or the tap dancing on ""I think I'm going to kill myself"", with it's vaudeville feel. Then of course there are the hits ""Honky Cat"" and ""Rocket Man"". Add to that the gorgeous ""Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters"" and you have a very good album. The 12 page booklet contains all the lyrics and a 4 page essay."
5,Great Shampoo,"I bought this shampoo because it was recommended to me by a friend. She told me to look on Amazon to see if they had any good deals, which I found one. This shampoo gives great volume and body... I would recommend this to everyone!"
3,Shallow Treatment,"I was disappointed in this film, though it was entertaining. There was no character development among the children, or in fact very much development of anybody. I had hoped to learn something of Gullah culture from this film, and was left wanting. There is no discussion of who these folks are, of their history, why they live in isolation on an island.This film could have been so much better. As it was, it could have been another Robin Williams film with the misunderstood, altruistic clown with a heart of gold battling the bad old establishment. I'm sure the book is much better. This is superficial, lighthearted entertainment at best."
2,Pure Fiction,"If you go into this film knowing what you are about to see is BS, it's not that bad. I have read up on the Beatles for years, and had hoped at least for some entertainment value, but I have to admit there are several places where this film just reaches. The aforementioned Heather Mills connection is, of course, laughable and not possible.Then there are the many factual errors (giving L&M; credit for George's ""Only a Northern Song""; Abbey Road was the last album recorded by the band, not Let it Be, etc.), and lastly George's voice. That is not him, and the obvious dubbing of George's interview clips is a great dishonor to George. I have to wonder, too, if the filmmakers created this as fiction. If so, they needed to have researched better.Next we'll be hearing that the MI5 silenced Linda by giving her cancer. Bleh!"
3,Somewhat disappointing,"I bought this toaster oven because it seemed so practical in design, and I do like the fact that it takes up very little counter space. However, it will not toast 4 normal slices of bread at one time without overlapping the pieces, which I could not anticipate from the picture, and it toasts darker on the bottom of the bread slice than on the top. Also, there is a learning curve for setting the dial to achieve the amount of toasting you want, and the toaster does not turn off automatically when the door is opened. If you over-estimate the toasting time you want and have to pull the bread out before the oven is finished working, you risk burning yourself on the still hot elements."
1,quality not good,"The day after I ordered this I was shopping at Meijer and found a similar, but narrower unit for $20. I put it together and was going to refuse this item when it came. Unfortunately, it didn't work where I wanted it, so I kept this piece when it arrived. The quality of the $20 unit I bought was much better than this! The finish is nice on it, but that's about the only good thing I have to say. The shelves don't sit evenly- the unit side walls feel unstable- the directions are awful and it is awkward to assemble. I've put together a lot of this type of thing, the latest project being a captain's bed, so I am comfortable with assembling these types of items. Definitely not worth the price."
2,"Nice hero, weepy/whiny heroine","Gerard deserved better - he is blackmailed into marrying a spineless, weepy childlike woman who then betrays him, that was nice, and then it's only when she changes that she gets some spine. I like the tone of the book, but I don't like pushover heroines who are in constant need of handkerchiefs."
3,"Good enough, but no more","A good-enough Bollywood/videogame/SF film which, unfortunately, never rises above being a well executed string of cliches. Not a waste of time to watch, but not something to seek out."
4,A collector's bonanza.,"Bear Family Records has done it again! The world's premier packager of oldies from the 1950-60's has taken the LIN/KLIFF masters and given collectors a bonanza. Here are valuable early releases by Ken Copeland, The Strikes, and The Chuck-a-Lucks whose later masters were leased to IMPERIAL Records; Buck Griffin, Andy Starr, Margee Robinson whose later masters were leased to MGM Records; Jerry Fuller, whose contract went to CHALLENGE and COLUMBIA Records; The Tu-Tones, The Atmospheres, The Mints, Steve Wright, Honee Welch, and Ray Ruff were all leased to LONDON/DECCA Records. These artists were innovators and producers of new sounds and songs in rockabilly, country, pop - you name it. ENJOY!"
4,"Very useful, but...","I really like this item. Nice to get all my brooms, mops, etc. off the floor that were falling down constantly. The problem is only 4 out of 5 slots work! Not worth taking off the wall and sending back. Glad 4 is enough. Otherwise I would give 5 stars."
2,Wow- this is sad,"This album really isn't any good. the tracks aren't as polish the sound un-original and down right boring.I got this album based on name alone since Vegas, and to a minor extent tweekend are decent albums that I enjoyd on occasion back in the days. I always had gripes with the unfinished/unoriginal song structures method uses, usually just looping a song at the end to death of fading, tweekend fixed that to some extent and the seemed like they where on the verge of really hitting a high mark. But this is horrible. they lost all the energy they had been costing on. and still don't seem to know how to write really great music. My stock in crystal method plumeted to an all time low. After fighting (not finding) its way into my heart with some of the catchiest BIG beats back in the day .. So bad it makes tweekend and vegas sound ""better"""
1,auug!!!,"Totally can't believe I received two damaged DVDs in an order. Imagine my shocking disappointment, not only was the picture split into two screens, the color was off. And the redhead characters were blue!! Movie night ruined. Does not deserve one star."
1,Terrible Disappointment!,"While working at a bookstore in college, a coworker referred me to Robert Jordan's novels (he was on book 5 at that time). I was hooked and devoured each book in the series, unable to put them down. Even the more recent books, while slow in the plot, kept me interested. I got this book when it first came out, tried to read it and lost interest. I have half of it to read still and may not even bother. He spends too much time on details which do not carry the story. Nothing happened up to where I've read and from the reviews it sounds like nothing will either. Sigh."
4,Small Price for a lot of Sound,"I was looking for a boombox that would play MP3 formatted CDs as well as regular CDs and have an auxillery input jack for my MP3 player. This RCA boombox has all of these features and it offers great sound. It has predefined playing modes (rock, jazz, classical, pop)and a bass boost feature which adds some depth to the music that plays. Sure you can find something a lot louder that costs a lot more. But for the money this little boombox can hold it's own. I also like that it is light weight, easy to carry around with you, and has a user friendly interface. The only feature that I would like to have had is a remote. But again for the price you can't go wrong."
3,A bit disappointing,"An amusing look at letters Einstein received from children, and some (very few actually) of his responses. I appreciated most the forward from Einstein's granddaughter and those few responses to some letters.I wish there had been more responses included, but realize that would have been difficult to do. In light of that, I wish they had chosen a better title."
1,Motor Problems on a Black and Decker Cyclonic DustBuster,"Purchased a Black and Decker Cyclonic DustBuster, worked for a few weeks then it would not run except when held upside down. Looked like the brushes on the electric motor were messed up. Threw it in the trash. With all the good reviews written about this item, it appears to be one of the best small vacs, I might just try another unless I can find a better quality one. The wife likes hand vacs."
4,Easy read,This was a nice clean book. It had romance without a lot if sex. I wish more authors would learn to write cleaner. I like to share books with my grand kids but most of them have too much sex.
5,Great read,This was recommended by a book club. It was hard to put the book down once I got started. Very thoughtful and interesting history I was not aware of --I give it the top rating.
4,A great adventure novel,"Lincoln Child and Douglas Preston know how to write a good book. Anyone who has ever read ""Relic"" can attest to that. They know how to write great characters and convincing plots and scenes that will have you holding tight to your pillow as you read them in bed. They know what scares us.And they know what excites us. Thunderhead is exciting. It's Indiana Jones exciting! It's the sense of adventure in a dangerous place. Searching for a lost city made of gold! The cast of characters is great - especially with Bill Smithback back for more Preston/Child fun. This a great read that will leave you eager to do a little exploring of your own.FYI: If you are a fan of novelists who drop their characters from one book into other books (i.e. Stephan King), then you should check these guys out. Read `em in this order: Relic, Reliquary, Thunderhead, Cabinet of Curiosity, Still Life with Crows, Brimstone, and Dance of Death (brand new).Good reading!"
2,Great for veg - NOT for rice!,"We had a stainless steel one which was fantastic but needed replacing and bought this one. Sadly, we wished we hadn't.The holes are too big and let the rice through both before and after it has been cooked.The idea is a great concept and it cooks the rice beautifully with minimum hassle. This would be great for veg. but don't buy it for rice unless you don't mind wasting a fair amount."
4,Loved the Cd.,"I love the music on the CD, but where's Flagpole Sitta. I don't understand why they kicked off Harvey Danger! I like all the songs, but that was one of the best!"
1,MAKE SURE YOU HAVE WIN98 CD,you must have your windows 98 disk to load the camera to your computer. I dont have mine and can't download my pictures so i have a camera i cant use
4,Just a regular text book,"Not much to review. It's a decent text book, includes chapter summaries of each chapter for quick reference during class. Easy to find key words, good extra features and articles. A well written text book."
1,Misleading Ad for iPod Charger,"Advertisement indicates that this charger is for iPod Shuffle, Nano, etc. I ordered the charger, and after 3 weeks (which is another story), I received the device, but it did not charge my iPod Shuffle. I sent several e-mails to the company (inspiretech), and they finally agreed to send a replacement, and asked me to retract my negative rating. I recently received the replacement, and it also does not charge the Shuffle. After numerous attempts to contact inspiretech, no response. I guess they are done with me. Watch Out!!! THIS WILL NOT CHARGE AN iPOD SHUFFLE, regardless of what the ad says."
1,I don't get it.,"It wasn't scary. It wasn't interesting. It wasn't particularly well-written. It was difficult to read. In short, WTF?"
4,Clerks meets Pulp Fiction,"I am a big Pulp Fiction fan. A friend saw this movie at an Film Festival and said I would really like it. Its really good. Its like the characters from Clerks were thrown into Pulp Fiction. The acting is good the editing is great, good music and great dialogue."
2,Not worth the money,I purchased this for my daughter on her fourth birthday and the only thing she liked about was throwing the balls around. I would say this game is more for 1 to 2 yr olds. This game got put away in the closet as soon as the birthday party was over.
4,Love the Pigs!,"I loved the story of ""Pigs in the House""! The rhyming makes the story move along, and the pictures are great. I was disappointed that this was not a full size book though, I didn't realize this when ordering. Other than that, a great purchase."
2,Not great,"I have a small dog (15 lbs), and she can't get the eggs out. I can barely get them out myself. The hole is too tight. She does love playing with the eggs by themselves, and the empty hedgehog by itself, but it wasn't worth the cost. She has plenty of other squeaky balls and empty stuffed animals, I wanted something that would keep her busy."
1,Not as advertised,"To whom it may concern:I was suppose to receive a ""box"" set of books. Instead, I received 5 mangled books stuffed ina mail bag. Very displeased!"
4,Sweet looking rocket!,"This is my second rocket kit from Quest... I've built about 30 rockets over the years. First, note that I ordered, sent back, then got another order with botched decals (guessing from heat and decals sticking to the instruction sheet), but called Quest and they sent me new decals (took 1.5 weeks). Aside from that, this is a good kit - fun to make and looks super. I did not make it fully to scale as the 'air scoop' seemed like it would add a lot of drag during flight. Also note the tail cone is paper and not blown plastic, so it is a bit delicate. I've only launched her once, but she flew extremely well - be careful to direct the launch rod vertically, because if this bird gets going horizontal, you better have a LOT of recovery room (seems like all the missile rockets do). Very happy to have this one on my shelf!"
2,Problem - Lens cap does not attach,"I was very disappointed when I opened the box to find that the lens cap is a hard, plastic, solid piece that has to be removed each time you use the camera. I knew I would set it down one time, and it would be lost or misplaced (or grabbed and hidden by my twin toddlers). It is a solid piece, without any holes to attach a string. I need a camera where the lens cap either automatically covers the lens when the camera is turned off, or at least can attach easily with a string.Because of this feature alone, I returned the camera. I cannot rate its photo quality."
1,Can't Judge this book by its Title!,"VBA Programming for the Absolute Beginner, I have to say I'm very disappointed with this book, You certainly can't judge this book by its title!It seems like it'd be great if you're already an expect macro writer and just need a reminder about what certain functions do. If that's not you, then this book is probably not for you.I'm a beginner and had trouble at the beginning of the book (page 12). does not work if your using Excel 97, but I have both '97 & 2003 and had problems with both systems. Why would one continue on in a book where you can't get the 1st example to work? I'm sending it back!"
4,Fun and goofy! Sense of humor required!,"This may not be one of Goldsmith's best (and this is a short score, alas) but it is great fun. Where can you find music that fits that desperately-needed Japanese/Jazz/Baseball niche? He does it all - combines the baseball theme, a jazz element, and a Japanese sound, all in one score. Come on! Not everyone can do that! But Goldsmith does. It's great fun!If you are a Goldsmith fan, you'll want this in your collection. You never know when you may need some Japanese/Jazz/Baseball music, after all!"
4,Deadend of Besiegers,"The movie is fun to watch. Takes you to Japan and China. As some of the subject matter is predictable, its still a very good movie. I would say at the very least 3 and a half stars. The fights are pretty good, and the acting is believable. The only thing I didn't like was they should have shown Ogawa return to Japan and fight the foreigner.Still a movie to watch and the DVD is excellent."
1,SHORT Story! Not a Novel.,"I really enjoy Mr. Joyce's work in general. Note, however, that this is a 30-page short story that you might mistakenly purchase thinking its a full novel (given that it's priced as such).I was in a rush to grab some reading material before traveling the next morning. I was rather disappointed to find out how little there was to entertain me on a long flight."
2,was a nice thought,"I ordered this product before my trip to Cozumel. On the second day there while clearing the mask, the snorkel came out of the holder and sunk. I was unable to find it and had to rent gear the rest of the trip. I've never had that happen before and am not impressed with the clip on this product."
2,Ehh..,It was kind of hard to understand in the middle and end but all around a good read good for middle schoolers
5,Excellent product,"I thought this was the same jacket I saw at the mall for $200, but found out when I got it that it was actually a better jacket. Showed up in good time, and perfect condition. Would reccomend this to anyone looking to stay warm but not be sweating to death inside of it."
1,for what ?,""" For those who have faith, no explanation is necessary, for those who do not have faith, no explanation will suffice ""Whatever your purpose is for writing the book, you wasted your time."
2,bang!,"Had it for a month, liked it for the most part, but the picture seemed a bit shaky... after a month or so, there was a loud static crack and the picture went out. I don't think I would be comfortable recommending this model."
2,Wouldn't buy from this seller,"Lancome Definicils is a high qualitly product. I rated this just 2 stars b/c I think the seller must have had it for awhile b/c after a very short while it was dry and clumpy. This happens all to soon even when I buy it from the department store, but from this seller it happened even sooner. I will re-order it next time from Lancome on-line and pay the shipping."
3,a little anoyning,this game is okay. the only problem is that theres this anoyning guy. he keeps saying i bet you cant hit that. he keeps saying that in each level. man thats anoyning. spiderman the movie game was much better than this. way better. if there going to have star wars 3 just dont put that anoyning guy in there.
4,Great Costume. Excellent Company Customer Service!,"After receiving this costume, my daughter put it on and it fit great except the cowl/mask. It was much too small for her head (and her head is average size). I contacted the maker of the costume, Rubie's Costume Co. and they were great! They offered to send a new, larger cowl to me. The larger one fit much better, bigger than her head, but at least it fit this time. Now she has a great costume to play in and wear for Halloween. I would definitely order a Rubie's Costume again."
1,"Bowie goes ""slowie""","Terminally boring. Starts with some energy given to ""Rebel Rebel"" and then quickly dies in a sea of pseudo-emotional drivel with occasional instrumental interludes that try, unsuccessfully, to get some life into the performance. Evidence of the tepid tone of this performance is indicated by the limited audience response to most of the songs. Bowie should stick with his hits and save us having to hear his ""poetry"", which lacks punch and tends toward over production of what is aruably nothing more than commercial filler."
1,Broke after one day,"Everything about this product was great, until the swivel mount broke after one day's use, despite treating them very carefully. When I called Logitech to arrange a refund, the customer care rep told me there had been several similar problems in the last few days. Logitech could not have been more helpful, and are giving me a full refund. Delivery from TigerDirect also good."
2,"Ok printer, but not all functions work with Vista",You can not use the scan function with Vista. You have to open Paint software and scan from within it. Very time consuming and had I known I would not have purchased this printer. I am using a HP Computer and this is a HP printer. You would think they would be compatible. Shame on HP for putting out an inferior printer. I expect more from them.
3,"Great movie, *terrible* dub","I love Crouching Tiger, it's one of my very favorite movies, but it gave me a nasty shock when the first line came out as ""Li is back!!"" not in Chinese.It got worse from there. While the voices for Shu-lien and Li Mu Bai were alright (they were probably done by Michelle Yoah and Chow Yun-Fat, who can speak english), Shao-Long's (Jen) and Lo's and pretty much everyone else's were really bad. It also became confusing. Jade Fox was not only referred to as 'Jade Fox' but as something in Chinese as well, an attempt at retaining bits of the original, I suppose, but a pretty pathetic one.This is a movie that deserves to be kept as close to the original as possible, not Americanized in the slightest. Dubbing destroys it."
3,Three days,"Three days is a story about an 11 year old girl named jackie who was abducted by a man after his own granddaughter of the same age had died.She was tacken to his home in italy and there she tried many times to leave.Read to find out how jackies attemps to flea turned out,and if she would ever be able to return to her family again.The story line was good,but the book was often slow moving and hard to keep my attention.I also thought the book ended to soon,I wanted to know what came next."
3,disappointment at the saga's finale,"I looked forward to Band of Brothers, preordering the book. However, I found that the book seemed rushed, as if the author, like our central character and his Republic, were tired of the long war. There were occasional moments when the author's skill resurfaced to enthrall one, but overall the book was a big disappointment, not worthy of the rest of the series."
3,"Sturdy 3"" inch risers!","The clear bed risers are sufficient for my purpose, which is to raise the head of my bed 3 inches. Equally important, the risers seem to be sturdy. However, a major drawback for me is the fact that the risers cannot increase my bed height to 4 inches if desired. The manufacturer specificlly states that ""only 3 risers may be stacked together."" In short, if you want to raise the head of your bed 3 inches, or the entire bed 2 inches, the risers are suitable--but 4 inches is inadvisable."
5,Outstanding work by favorite duo,I absolutely loved this CD. Gerry Beckley and Dewey Bunnel are amazing.I admire their committment and dedication to the integrity of their craft.Hour Glass is superb from the first song to the last bathing the listener in gentle articulate lyrics and soothing melodic sounds.Hourglass is as refreshing as a candlelit bubble bath.I put on this CD when I want to escape the world and from the first note to the last the stress rolls off my body and my mind becomes clear and tranquil.I also highly reccomend America's Human Nature CD.
1,Stupid,This movie is rediculous. The interpertaion of Bob's second wife is totally a lie. There is nothing like lying to the movie audience.
4,TinHorn,"Whoah, boys, easy. Amazing how some people go off. Let's make that amusing. If you like westerns, Wyatt Earp, OK Corral, Doc Holliday, Johnny Ringgold (Ringo), and Josie Marcus (Dana Delany - hard to forget her face after the Tombstone movie), you're apt to appreciate this book. Excellent dialogue! Fine western!"
3,An OK cheesy video game movie.,"This was passable entertainment, nothing more. It is not as bad as people make it out to be, and it is certainly better than most horrible movies i've seen. The two leads have good chemistry which works, and Dennis Hopper does an OK job playing Koopa. The script is campy, and the lines given by the two guys in the cab is plain dumb. Just watch this movie once, or twice, but it does the video game it's justice."
1,Too Screwy - Another POOR Fisher Price Design,"I have yet to be happy with a Fisher Price toy in the last 3 years. (See my reviews of the Little People Garage, Discovery City, and train).Screwy Looey looks like a great concept, however, the drill is WAY too screwy. The switch that supposedly switches him from Screwy to Normal operation does not work at all, it is always screwy. My son can't understand why it won't drill right, and it is highly frustrating even for an adult. I can't stand touching the darn thing, because it will never do what I want it to, and the reset button doesn't help much, and is too small, as others have pointed out. In my opinion, it is time for some consumer advocate to do a report on Fisher Price, and what happened to their quality, and their fun.This is the worst designed toy ever, and the worst constructed."
3,New Concise World Atlas,"I am very pleased with the Atlas, it is easy to use and very accurate. The size is perfect, magnifing glasses are not needed. I have had some trouble however identifiying & finding rivers & topographical features, perhaps they should be indexed also."
4,Great customer service,"I've used the warranty service almost 4 years after I bought the TV. The warranty is actually 3 years because it starts from the day you purchase the item. When I called NEW for the service they appointed a really great contractor that came out to check out what was wrong with the TV. The tech stated that the DMD chip needed to be replaced along with the lamp as the TV is rear projection DLP. The tech said that they might not replace the lamp as in the contract it states that it's a ""consumable"" item and not covered by the warranty. I called the NEW place and asked if they could replace the lamp. The agent on the phone stated that she will escalate the case to research to see if the lamp can be replaced. After several days I got a call from NEW stating that both parts were approved for replacement. Two days later the tech showed up and replaced them. The TV picture quality is like brand new."
2,Great when it functions,"I bought it from Amazon in February and the earphone jack failed in three months. Check Creative's forum to see how common this problem is.It was still under warranty and I sent it back for repair. They sent me another one with the disclaimer that this may be a refurbished unit. This one lasted about a month before the hard drive completely crashed. Again, check Creative's forums to see how common this problem is.The warranty is almost done on this product, so I'm looking at IPods now.When it actually works, it sounds great."
1,"Failed, 2 for 2","I purchased two of these in April, 2009. The first failed in the second month, the second just failed today. In both cases, I received the message ""memory card error"" in two different cameras (neither would read them). Nothing like losing hundreds of pictures to make you really happy about a product. The low price isn't worth losing photos."
3,Works fine & workmanship is okay,"The adage ""you get what you pay for"" comes into play here. The money clip works fine ... clip holds bills just fine. External pockets are a tad snug but workable. Yhe center pocket is snugger and a bit less convenient as a result. The quality of the leather is commensurate with the cost.So it's serviceable but not polished. At this price it's unfair to expect much more; but I wouldn't complain if it gave me more!'"
2,"Love the smell, but it doesn't last for crap!","Unlike another reviewer, I actually love the smell of this deodorant. However, the effectiveness is just plain awful. Under normal usage, I'm lucky if I go half the day before it's like I'm wearing nothing at all. I can't even go an entire work day without it wearing off. That's terrible. I've used Axe or Right Guard for the past 12 years or so, and they provide 24 hour protection, so I haven't smelled my armpits since I was in my teens! I honestly think this stuff might have ingredients in it that CAUSE your armpits to smell! I never, ever stink or smell, but after wearing this stuff, I smell like pure B.O. at the end of every single work day. It's incredible. This stuff is garbage! Back to Axe I go!"
4,A pretty good book!,"A very good book, showing how two worlds can be so distinct, yet come together and get along at some point in their history. Powerful story line, with great characters, and easy to follow, yet complicated in it's own punish way"
4,Wonderful remake!,I just loved this remake of this classic movie. Mara is just so precious in the role of Susan! Brings the classic tale into the present day. Well worth watching. . . more than once!
2,Too hard to read on my kindle,"Wanted to be able to track my whereabouts in Vietnam, and probably would be able to do so in a book rather than on a kindle. Unable to read maps or use indexes to assist in reading."
3,Great Heavy Slider - Nut and bolts don't Match?!?,"This would be an easy 5 stars. Heavy duty, slides easily, locks and latch releases convenient and excellent durability. Very adjustable. My server cases are much shorter than my SAN case, fully adjusted and still very sturdy. Why 3 stars? The mounting nuts do not match the bolts! Will not thread on! I purchased 2 of these units, not a fluke, both delivered items had the problem. Went to local shop and purchased the right bolt for the provided nuts. How do you ship a product where the threads don't match? Bewildered. It's a shame a great product like this would have such a crazy problem."
4,Best to have,"Since we had a power outage, I checked the date on the last one I purchaced (important to put a date on this type of product) as they won't last forever, so for the safty of my HDTV and cable box, I bought a new one."
1,Shouldn't a radio pick up at least ONE station?,"If I could give this radio zero stars, I would. It has NO reception. I cannot tune in even one station on either band. You pay $4 for a radio, you get a $4 radio."
4,I have very large pores on and around ...,I have very large pores on and around my nose so I was excited about trying this out. I was amazed at the results. I could actually see a visible difference in their appearance. I was skeptical at first because I found in the ingredients that it contains alcohol and I was disappointed. My skin is very sensitive and I was afraid that it would dry out my skin. I used it every day for a week with no redness or dry patches. I love its smell -- real fruity and fresh. It left my skin feeling fresh and smooth without any dryness or tightness.
3,Pretty Good,"Pretty good, the different rubber cups are really good at changing the size. they seem to be designed for slightly bigger ears than mine though. Can be uncomfortable at times, but definitely secure fit."
4,Fantastic Series,"I can not agree with the negative reviews. I actually found Rama (the first book) the weakest (and shortest) of them all. The one that caused my emotions to come out most was the last book. Gentry Lee writes very well, I could not put the books down. I read all 4 books of this series in one go and seen in context they really are one big story, so it is hard to judge them separately. As a whole they tell one fantastic story with a stunning and tragic (open) end."
1,"Book recalls past exuberance, not current reality","From this book:""Can you increase your wealth [from the real estate boom]? The answer is a resounding yes.""...real estate is poised to climb higher over the next decade...and continue to outpace other investments"" And so on throughout this book.So, how is that investment strategy going, Mr. Lereah? Let's let Lereah answer that in his own words, as spoke to a group of 400 Florida realtors on Thursday, April 27th:""The region's real estate economy must recover from a hangover wrought by a spasm of speculation and easy money""Has this book's thinking at all contributed to this ""spasm of speculation?"" Does Lereah's right hand know what his left hand is doing? Buyer beware."
3,Cute but not too entertaining,Purchased this for my daughters first Christmas. It is a really cute set but she was not too interested in it. It did not get played with very often.
5,Time for Yesterday,I love any story that centers on my favorite original Star Trek person - Spock. The fact that Spock had a son in Yesterday's son and now Zar has to help save the present/future is a great plot. The whole book was great and I read it cover to cover in one sitting.
4,Satisfied!,I am very happy with this ice shaver.My only minor complaint would be it doesn't shave regular ice cubes as well as the provided ice mold. It should include 4 molds instead of 2.
5,Help ideas for getting back into nature,Very useful book on practicing mental discipline in a fun adventurous way! Many ideas of how to practice this great mental discipline without it being drudgery!
5,Great,"The book is of litle help, but the video is superb. Dr. Meyer is really a great comunicator and knows what he is talking about. The course isn't intended for those looking for technical details, but as an overall picture it is clear, complete and very enjoyable to follow."
3,Interesting case studies,"This book includes interesting narratives from librarians in a variety of jobs outside of the traditional library. However, the book predates the explosion of technology and the Internet, so it doesn't really touch on MLS grads working in computer-related jobs. The book includes 62 personal case studies and is divided into the following sections: (1) publishers, writers, booksellers, reviewers, (2) products and services for libraries, (3) independent librarians, (4) independent librarians with companies of their own, (5) association work and work in the academic world, (6) librarians employed in the corporate world, (7) some librarians who have traveled farther afield (includes private investigator, archivist, etc)."
1,"Looks cute, but it's just cheesy.","Fortunately, this product is ""currently unavailable."" Should it ever become available again, do yourself a favor: avoid it. It looks like it might be a decent little iPod player that one could fold up and carry from home to work to vacation spots or whatever. If you were able to listen to it before buying it, you'd realize that it's just not good enough quality for any of these purposes. Tinny, weak sound. Way, way overpriced. Too bad I had to choose even a single star to rate it."
1,Whats alll the hype?,"I really do not see what people see in this. They are no different the the backstreet boys, and n'sync. You can find a son about love any day, any time. Trust me, this is nothing even remotely close to special, or original. This is just another band that got caught up in the trend of ""boy bands"" or whatever you guys call it. 98 degrees will just be forgotten like any other band that sold out."
4,Good buy at the time,"I've had my Nyko charge station for just under two years now. It's served me well all this time as I've never once bought batteries for my Wii-motes.I've decided to write this review to inform potential buyers to take care of the product during use. One of my rechargeable batteries that came with the package is no longer functional. This is as a result of the contacts at the back of the batery being eroded, as well as the contacts on the charger stand being slightly bent and/or pushed in.Other than that this was a great buy and at least I've still got one battery left that holds charge excellently ( I'm a casual gamer) as I've never had the batteries die while I'm playing even if I play a couple hours a day and forget to recharge the batteries between each use. I won't purchase another one though as I'll opt for regular rechargeable batteries that I can charge without putting a remote out of commission to do so."
3,Okay for a quick overview,"A slender book that has some good information and interesting illustrations, but about one-third of the book is devoted to ""famous"" Scots-Irish and the historical information is superficial. Probably meant for younger readers, might be best for a quick overview, particularly since it often sells for under $1."
4,A great book about parenting!,"Aside from the title, this book is great. Kids, as the author points out, aren't inherently ""bad"" and I think many parents who could benefit from this book won't pick it up because their kids aren't ""delinquents."" Anyway, I liked the messages and it was an easy read...why hasn't Hayes written more?"
4,50 / 50,They sent the wrong table. I ordered this table for my Dad. He likes to eat in the living room so he can watch TV. I ordered the table with the offset base thinking it would provide more room for his feet and legs. They shipped the one with a centered base. I did not want to wait or bother with returning this item. Oh Well. I guess this one will work.
1,Don't bother,"I purchased these based on other favorable reviews, but based on the pair that I received they are barely worthy of 1 star. The noise canceling electronics are nearly useless, compared to, for example, the Audio Technica ATH-ANC7 headset. There is little discernible reduction in ambient noise with the electronics switched on vs off. The electronics also adds quite a bit of hiss to the background. The yoke that spans the top of your head is uniquely uncomfortable. To round out the deal, the cord retracts into the left earpiece. While a nice idea, I've already had to disassemble this earpiece twice to untangle the mechanism. Buy something else. Spend the money for the Audio Technica ATH-ANC7 or a nice pair of over the ear headphones that have good sound quality and are comfortable."
1,Waste of money and time,"Game is totally ruined as of 15 November 05, save your money for WOW, EQ, or if you want SW go for Battlefront."
5,Bravo Iota.,"This albumn is a musical masterpiece. The overall balance that is achieved on this albumn is spectacular. I first heard iota after downloading one of the songs from Napster - and instantaneously had to purchase the entire albumn. This magnum opus of an album is a credit to the band and clearly demonstrates the immense talent and potential that Iota have. Song 1 - Triplespoon, with its mix of powerful vocals and sensual strings sets a strong tone for the remaining 10 songs that follow. A must for anyone who claims to enjoy music! Bravo Iota - Encore!"
3,Kinda Disappointing,This copying book does not provide a transliteration. Since one of the main objectives is to familiarize yourself with the ligatures that would have been nice. But it does have some nifty phrases.
4,Oh my!,This video is like a train wreck that you can't turn away from. I truly wonder if (and how) these folks' lives changed since doing the documentary.
3,SO SO,"50 Cent has talent, but this album showed no display. Sha Money's beats were not doing it, Eminem's beat didnt shine. The lyrics were not exactly gangsta or floss. I expect a 2Pac hit em up style or California love party till the morning style. But only a couple of songs assembled that, In da Club, Back Down, Blood Hound. Some of the other songs are plain garbage and you cannot sit through it. Delivery was okay, gets a B- but the lyrics about getting shot 9 times and how bad Ja Rule is is pretty old. PIMP is very commercial. If I Can't was a listenable son but 21 questions is trying to show his mellow side, and he wasn't very good at it. ""I love u like a fat kid loves cake."" good metaphor there. Hes a rookie and he has alott of protential under Eminem and Dr. Dre, hes crew display little talent, but as long as he shines, he will be okay."
3,WHY IS IT BACKWARDS!?!,"I do like that Mariah supposedly ""hand picked"" this compilation, but what drives me up the wall is the fact the stupid thing is backwards. All the newer songs (bar I Still Believe) are at the beginning and all her later hits are at the end, which makes it very confusing when manually looking for a certain track on the CD player. The track listing isn't on the back, either. It's on the insert. The back just has a randomized list of songs on a bullet chart. If you want to get technical (and I don't really give a crap about the number status of her singles), I believe a hand full of the songs never exactly made it to one on the chart."
2,The Canon E18 error,"I bought the canon S80 a year back. During the new years party yesterday i got the E18 error. The lens won't retract or extend after this. After researching this error, i am pretty annoyed about it. In nutshell, the camera is as good as trash now. Listen to the other reviewers and at least search for ""canon E18 error"" before you buy any canon camera. On the positive side, this camera took good pictures till it worked."
5,"Rejoice, Ye Geek Children Of the 1970s","For those of us who are aging nerdy children of that golden era of the 1970s and 80s, this is the perfect item for a little of that disposable income. Totally geektastic. I've got a few Vipers hanging from the ceiling of my one-year old son's room, another above the fireplace, and a few for playing with. Never can have too many Vipers to fend off the occasional pesky Cylon home invasion.Why quibble over quality? It's a piece of injection-molded plastic, made from petroluem by-products and releasing deadly carbon into our atmosphere in the process of its construction. As a cheap toy it is par excellence, a modern relic of this brief shiny period in human history when such things are mass-produced and cheaply available.It is fun. Buy one. It even looks cool with the wings on backward, as in the display photo.So say we all!"
2,Good movie!,I rented this movie along time ago on VHS. I kind of liked it. I thought it was pretty good. It didn't have good acting but it was good. It was called kidnapping when he wanted to keep the kid because he was trying to find the natural parents for him. I also think the title should be changed because he wasn't a daddy he was just looking after him for awhile. Some of the scenes were funny but not that funny. The kid did a good job for his first acting career. Adam Sandler was allright. He's not usually good in his movies but he is funny. The only thing that made me laugh in this movie was when he got mad and when he and the kid were peeing on the building.
1,Receiver did not work,"We bought this alarm clock to work with a baby monitor signaller made by the same company. When we plugged both of them and turned the receiver function on the clock went crazy: flashing lights, shaking bed, etc. It turns out that ""sometimes"" there is another signal in the houses electrical system that can interfere with the receiver. The Sonic Alert website said we could send it in and get them adjusted to another at a cost of $5 each plus $7 shipping. We did that, and now when we turn the receiver on it just vibrates and buzzes even if the signaller isn't plugged in.Otherwise, it's an ugly alarm clock. The vibrating puck doesn't wake my wife up and the light feature gets ""stuck"" sometimes.Don't buy it."
2,Great camera until...it takes the shutter release error,"I've had this camera since it first came out. For a while it was wonderful! It took fantastic pictures and it's lightweight and easy to handle. But... October 2010 (on a very important day) it gave me an error about the shutter release button. A friend that is a professional photographer was able to fix it. In July 2011 I got the same error. When this error comes up, the camera doesn't work at all. I sent the camera off to Nikon and it took them about 8 weeks to supposedly fix it. It cost me about $200 to get it fixed. The error came back in September. You can bang on the camera and get the gears to release and it will work temporarily. I've had it with this camera! Before you buy it, Google ""Nikon Error Press Shutter Release"" and you'll find tons of complaints about it. :( I'm looking for a new camera now."
1,Needs improvement!,I was very disappointed in this product. I made two loaves of bread with it and they were both burnt with the light setting. I have had 2 bread machines before and never had this problem so I returned it. I think they have a problem with this machine I am not the first person with this complaint. I bought it because of the warranty.
3,What I learned was You (Mike) need to do more research!,"Found an error in Chapter 26, page 280, re: the last surviving Civil War veterans. The last Union veteran (Albert Woolson) died on August 2, 1956 (not the stated 1951)at age 109. The last Confederate veteran, Walter W. Williams (not the stated ""Walter Washington"")died on December 19, 1959 (not the stated 1952) at age 117. The reference for the above is the New York Times newspaper, August 2, 1956."
2,"If you waited for this, then you don't need it.","The guide has some good things in it, but if you have the exp. pack and had to wait for this guide then you probably know more about the game than the book tells. It's an ok guide, but I was left feeling as if I should have waited to buy it from a third party for about $2."
3,Color lables come off easily,I was disappointed with this version of the Rubik's cube. The manufacturer has glued colored papers that started to come off the second day of use. I think they should had used paint at minimum to make it long lasting.
5,Whoa....,"""The Lunatic Cafe"" was one wild ride. I dont know how Ms. Hamilton does it, but I swear the woman is brilliant. I have never been this addicted to a book. I absolutely COULD NOT put this down. In fact, its been that way with every book in this series thus far. My only problem now is that I have to wait for the next one to arrive. Until then I shall be watching my mail impatiently for the next installment. GO out and buy these books..you wont be sorry!"
2,This book only gets you to first base.,"This book does fairly well (but not wonderfully) to describe the basic concepts to the beginner, and it gives you some code to get started on. After reading this book and completing the examples, I only barely know enough to get started with ATL. If you buy this book you will soon need to read another just to feel competent in ATL.The first 75 pages are a very basic overview of templates and COM. The book then introduces ATL's implementation of IUnknown, IDL, Aggregation, IDispatch and Dual Interfaces, Connection Points, and Active X controls in the middle of the book. This content is covered in no real detail. The section (paragraph?) on marshalling is so thin that no useful information could be gained from it. Tacked on to the end are sections on Asynchronous Download, COM threading, MFC, and COM +. Without a detailed understanding of the core concepts of ATL, these sections are useless."
1,Natural,It's ok looking for a more sustainable one has a musty scent almost looking for something with better scent because Iam active a lot
1,overly elementary,"I bought this book thinking that it would be a good starting point to get some new words into my vocabulary for the general GRE. I don't have an extensive vocabulary by any means, and even I knew at LEAST 85% of the words in this book. If you're looking to prep for a standardized exam, don't bother wasting your money or time on this book."
3,"Feels good, looks good, but quality problems","This series of Visor cases seems quite nice. The visor locks in place solidly, the leather is good looking, and the unit appears well made.But two weeks after I got the case, the snap came apart. To Amazon's credit, they sent an immediate replacement. But the replacement's strap was just short enough to make the male and female snap pieces not meet easily.I'm going to keep the case anyway and see what happens. But my experience points to some quality control issues at Handspring manufacturing.--dave"
3,engrossing thriller,"This book is great reading for the beach or weekend. It moves quickly with a decent plot. The characters tend to be a little cardboard, particularly the villans. Du Brul does for geology what Clancy does for weapons systems-makes the subject interesting and the details give momentum to the story.With the villan (Kerikov) living to fight again, I'm anxious to read the next installment of the story"
2,Ghettos Tryin to kill me,This is there early days from 1994 when they were a Gangsta group back then they were better rappers.This again like earlyMaster P albums is in terrible quality but the rapping is goodAs I said if your in it for there style you will like it.Lyrics 8/10 Production 2/10 X Factor 2/10 Style 9/10 Voice 10/10Music 2/10 Innovative 3/10 Classic 3/10 Guest 4/10 Blends 3/10Overall=44 wich is about enough for a 2 Mic affair.Buy this if your into buying everything are into Master P arevery loud and awesome style rapping wich is good on here
1,Overwritten and Uninspired,"Due to Roiphe's insufferable tendency to place each of her personal experiences in the context of global events, I was completely exhaused by chapter two."
4,Hidden Star,I am a great fan of Nora Roberts and I have not found a book that I did not like yet. I was on edge most of the book wondering what was going to happen. she keeps me very interested and don't want to put it down. I can't wait for the other two to come out and I will read them too.
3,Love the wipes but...,"I love these wipes. What I hate about my most recent purchase however is the fact that the company changed the packaging and started packing 70 instead of 80 wipes per bag, yet selling them at the same price. Amazon did not alert me of this change (I have a subscription, so shipping is automatic) and I was mad to find out that I am receiving about 200 fewer wipes this time."
3,Faulkner uglified,"Faulkner strikes again in that in this one, the method of narration seems revolutionary and incredible. Once again he teaches me that a writer can switch times, characters and other elements and still tell the same story. The plot, aside from that, is fairly simple. But, given the enormously talented writer, this book just seemed ugly to me - ugly in the sense that the words seemed to be in sepia tones - leave it to Faulkner, he's good enough to plan it that way -. The idea of flies on the mother's body, and of Darl's thoughts, and of the poverty of the family and the seeming desperation of it all (it reminded me of ""Lonesome Dove""'s Woodrow Call painstakingly trying to bring Gus McCrae's body back to Texas) I just felt yucky the whole time I was reading it."
1,worked for 6 months.....,sounded good for the money. but then it broke 6 months later. if you buy it make sure you get a replacement warranty. I am going to buy a better one next time. you get what you pay for.
5,hose extention,It did everything I could expect. I would recommend this product to anyone that has trouble with their back due to bending over.
4,"Fun Shark Movie, Hot Girls","This was a fun movie. I was expecting it to suck but I liked the characters and it was pretty scary at some points.I had heard about Sarah Paxton before but never seen her in a movie, she is amazing. I rented her newest movie the Innkeepers based on seeing this just because she is so great.Her legs are so nice.Katherine McPhee also looked hot as hell, I am glad she went back to brunette and put on some weight, she looks so hot like she did when she first came out.I have to say though that the part where the black kid cites ""West Baltimore Rules"" as his reason for walking into the water to take the sharks on in a street fight was funny as hell but made the guy seem really stereotypical. The whole character of Malik came across like a minstrel show to me."
4,Nice Easter Music!,"The Easter songs are just right for kids. Easter songs make Easter so much more fun. These songs are fun to listen to! Along with this album, I would recommend 'Easter Songs to Christmas Melodies' by 'Nooshi the Balloon Dude' and 'A Very Veggie Easter' by 'Veggietales, also available for download on Amazon. Kids will be hoppin to these Easter songs."
5,College Chemistry Text Book,"This book does a good job of presenting material in a precise manner. Two classes at my college are taught out of this text book and I was amazed at how thin it was. It is not at all a heavy, bulky book but it still does an excellent job of explaining material and providing useful problems."
1,I'd give it zero stars if I could.,"After three installs and uninstalls of this program, I've had it. Spam still gets thru, Outlook locks-up, same problems over and over. SpamKiller should be put to sleep."
1,Noted Scientist,"Agreeing with other reviewers, I feel this may just be the worst movie ever made. At least Plan 9 had actual dialog spoken at the same time the movie was filmed. Tor Johnson'snly line is ""YAHHHH"", repeated several times when he finds his dead female victim has disappeared. Seems about right. I watched this as part of the 50 movie classics horror films, so I paid about 50c for it. About right"
5,"Great product, works wonderfule!","Received this product and it was easy to set-up, use and clean. Eating so much healthier now that we can cook our own lunch meats and slice them on this wonderful machine without the sodium nitrites! Great product."
5,My Favorite Novel - EVER!,"Words cannot express how I feel about this book. Irving's characters are so quirky and bizarre, yet I believe wholeheartedly in, and fall in love with every one of them. I was hooked from the first paragraph. The new film ""Simon Birch"" is based on this book. I fear no movie can ever do it justice."
5,"This is the best show on TV, ever, period.","I hadn't seen any of Season 1 before on the recommendation of someone at work, I started watching The Shield in the middle of Season 2. Oh, am I glad she made me watch this, as it's unlikely I would have found it, mired as it is on FX. Other reviewers here have mentioned that this is a great cop show. It is. But it's more than that. It is one of the very few shows where you can feel your guts twisted in ethical knots when you see the dilemmas faced by the Strike Team. Makes you wonder, ""what would I do in that situation."" Also makes you wonder ""how can they make this show any better?"" Bet they will, somehow... Can't wait for March '04 for the new season."
5,Great value on quality products,"You always get top notch products. If you do not check Amizon before you buy anything, you probably enjoy wasting money!"
3,harley softail,"this is a good shelf toy only. Not sure what make of harley this is. Has fatboy fenders,heritage wheels and roadking exhaust with a flame job on the tank. This is A good looking bike."
5,Celine Dion by MArianne McKAy,"The best book ,clear vivid pictures,precisely written.Each page is interesting,easy to read.It's a great book,every Celine fan should have,or even if this was not Celine,how this book compiled was IMPRESSIVE!!"
5,"Promise, Texas",This book arrived in a timely manner and was in great condition. Loved the book as it was an easy read.
5,Beautiful and Simple,I have worn these chandelier Earrings to several occasions. So simple and elegant. I have gotten many compliments on them. It's so versatile you can wear it just about any where. It looks great with your hair up or down.
1,Breaks Very Easily,"It's very poor quality, and breaks easily. I was rolling dough on it with a rolling pin and it broke. Save your money."
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased these, fortunately on sale, and was greatly disappointed. They are not actually noise reducing--technologically speaking. They have silicone ear covers that are supposed to seal out noise when fit in your ear properly. I was unable to fit them in my ears properly, despite the 3 different sized covers. Maybe it's just my ears, but I don't think so. I would not recommend these to anyone. Instead, spend a couple more dollars and get something that is not painful in your ears."
1,hate crusade,"I feel that christians and muslims will agree that this is a very negative view of Islam, many twisted and distorted claims are made and I feel that the writer has some sort of secret vendetta against muslims... Muslims and christians are both ""people of the book"" and should live peacefully and love each other, not creat hate crusades against each other. The muslims and christians are all children of abraham... I say don't waste your money on such propaganda trash."
4,quick n dirty,"The seller I bought this from sent me 2 for the price of 1! The seller was ExpressBuy123. They say these style of sharpeners can chip your blade and that Im sure is true, but its not a big concern for me. This is the fastest and easiest way to sharpen a knife."
3,Religion and Natural Law by C.F.Russell,"To tell the truth, with Christmas holidays and all the business, I have not even opened this book; in fact, I could not tell you where it is right now - probably with my supply of unused Christmas gifts I bought. I will find it and keep it for myself as I am interested in this."
1,Below average 640x480 cam....,"Sad. This is a average to below average 640x480 cam. There is no 4MP resolution as advertised. The best resolution it will do is 640x480. The rest is software produced which is not included and I still have not found yet. I am sure it wouldn't make the images much better any how. Scam, scam, scam. Avoid."
3,Am I the only one hearing this?!,"Alright, alright, I have to give Blink some credit for trying 'cause some parts of afew of the songs are great ya know, but this album just isnt them. It's cool that they wanted to try new things, but I just feel like not that much passion and authentic Blink 182 went into this album. I mean has anyone other than me actually listened to their previous records? Come on! I think that if they would've put a little more time and feeling into this album it would have been so much better. The lyrics now are just meaningless. Some do have feeling, but not very much and on their other albums you listen to the songs and you usually find a song that speaks to you, that you believe was written for you, but I haven't found one yet. All in all this is a cool cd, but it's not really what I had expected. So Blink, I love you but I just dont like this album."
4,Makes dispensing convenient!,"I use this as a condensed milk dispenser and love how clean/neat it makes everything. I actually have to stop myself from getting one for every syrup we use in my household... Golden, maple, honey, etc.I've had absolutely no trouble filling it, since I simply take a small piece of plastic wrap and make sure it's taut at the bottom. It's clean and easy, and takes me less than a minute to implement.All in all, I love how it's solved my issue with syrup sweeteners being too sticky/messy to use on an every day basis -- the only gripe I have is that I wish the lid was actual stainless steel, rather than plastic. :("
2,"weak band, lousy compass, no backlight, fails too much","I bought 2 T-Touch watches, one for my husband and one for myself. They are wonderful pieces, with very cool functions, if they worked, like someone said in another comment. My husband's has failed twice already, once the compass ceased working and now it stopped altogether. Obviously it does not resist water not even to wash your hands which is absurd for this type of watch. Mine has worked fine (but with minimum use) but the rubber strap (worth $115 to replace) just snapped off the watch and you could see the very thin rubber it had to hold itself on to the watch. The absence of such a simple thing as a backlight bothers me a lot, in the dark the watch is useless! Definitely too expensive for the quality. Not worth the Tissot name (I have other impeccable Tissot watches)."
3,Overseas buyers do your homework,"Advice that not all KA products fit all KA mixers would have been great. I bought these attachments and luckily, these sort of....fit, There should be information that US attachments may not always fit o'seas mixers, they don't fit perfectly but so far I am able to use most of them, fingers crossed.As for the product, ofcourse it's great and no probs with delivery / condition etc."
2,If I Hear Anticipation Again I'll Scream,"I don't understand the point of this compilation. Most of the greatest hits included here have already been defintively collected on 1975's The Best of Carly Simon. That was a long time again. I don't need or want to hear these songs again. Granted, they are classics that have found an immortal home in the sess pool that is pop culture, but they are also really worn and tired.Instead of highlighting the hits yet again, how about focusing on some of Simon's lesser known songs. ""We're So Close,"" ""Love You By Heart,"" ""It Happens Everday,"" In Times When My Head,"" are but a few of the precious gems buried deep within Simon's catologue. Let's unearth these songs, and bury ""Anticipation"" once and for all. Cause if I hear that song again, I'll scream."
3,frustration,"Wired Visikey Keyboard Large Print Pc and MacintoshI'm sure this is a good product, but it didn't work with the USB ports on my Dell PC. I called the company, and they were initially helpful, though they couldn't figure out why it wouldn't work on any of the ports on my PC. They said they'd send me another one, but my phone calls since then have gone unanswered. I have returned the keyboard for refund. I am disappointed, because it looked like a great product."
1,"Plainly, it just doesn't work!",So I bought the whole system and used it for about a month and a half...I later asked my friend if she sees a difference and she says they look more yellow. Before she made that comment I had noticed how it wasn't effective at all. I just thought it was all in my head. Don't use this system..I felt like my teeth did not get any cleaner after brushing patiently. I honestly got teeth that got more yellow..I followed directions perfectly. I used it only on a dry toothbrush. I always wet my toothbrush before applying toothpaste and so I bought an extra toothbrush just in case I make that mistake I would have a dry spare. I spent at least 7 minutes brushing. I just did it all man! and it didn't work...period. Drugstore brands do more for my teeth than this crap. I wasted my money...
2,Quick and Easy Game,"This was the first game i purchased for the Gamecube and if they're all this quick and easy to finish then i'm thouroughly disappointed. The graphics are nice, but clearly the game is challenging only for a young child. Please rent and do not buy this game. You can finish it in one full day."
5,biscuit cutter set,"I really like this set. I have used it just once, but the cutters are sharp and cut cleanly. Plus, I have every size I'll ever need! Based on other reviews, I was very careful to dry it before storing."
3,gets worse over time!,"As a huge queen fan I orginally thought this was a great listen, but over time only a few moments still are enjoyable. My highlights are ""let there be drums"" ""last horizon"" and when they had freddie on the big screen on ""bo rhap"" a few other good moments are mixed in with plenty of boring rubbish. For real queen pick up ""live at the bowl."""
2,Soil Mechanics and Foundation Design: 201 Solved Problems,The book seems not refined to me. The figures could be improved and the errors could be minimized. I would not recommend this book.
5,the curiosity of chance,what a wonderful little film. did not expect this to be a good as it isvery proud of the lead actor's work/ with BAND CAMP-being his first film he has shown he is a great actor.
2,Series Getting Worse and Worse,"The first two or three books of this series are terrific: detailed, well-written, intriguing, etc. However, since then, I find myself reading trashy, money-driven novels at the end of which, one of the many ""bad guys"" is killed. I bought the first six ... now I think I'll just sit down and skim them over a few hours. The series looks to go for another five or six books.... In other words, Jordan will be raking in the dough for at least ten more years. This particular book was lousy - the plot does not advance very far, the writing is poor, and the character development is virtually non-existent."
4,"A bit different, but still wonderful","It warns on the cover: ""a spoken word/instrumental CD"". Well, that's just what you get. The Rollins spoken word, though not consistently relevant, is thoroughly chilling and provides for a good ""once in a while"" listen. The instrumental part is just like the material from Process of Weeding Out, and is definitely an acquired taste and a difficult listen. However, if you (like me) enjoy the later era of Black Flag, you will probably love this album. It's not the best of the Flag, but it's probably their most experimental."
4,Very good album,"This album is pretty good but somehow it seems not as good as I expected when I heard ""Here with Me"". I know I shouldn't just run out to buy an album for just one song but I did with this one. I usually find at least two songs I like before buying a cd.The lyrics are there, except it sounds as if she's just talking really fast for long lyrics to accomodate the music. I know I shouldn't criticize the way how someone speaks but sometimes I have a hard time understanding her to, I think, the southern accent."
1,Worst film of Cronenberg's career,"I was looking forward to this film, because of the respect I have for Viggo Mortensen and Michael Fassbender. But this is a by-the-numbers, simplistic, and rather dreadful film. Kiera Knightley's performance is laughably bad...about the level of a Saturday Night Live character. Watching her jut her chin out and bug out her eyes in the first ten minutes made me dread buying this dvd. There's a reason it wasn't in the theaters long...it's awful. One star."
2,Too many topics,"This book is meant for first or second year major student in physics. I am a second year student myself and I found this book quite frustrating. It covers many topics in modern physics, perhaps too many. The treatment of subject is not thorough enough and especially the real theoretical side is often omitted. The subject is difficult enough by itself and this book is not the greatest source of information."
5,Incredible!,"This was an amazing book that I could not put down. It has a lot of action and is face- paced. The novel takes you through many emotions. The part of the book that stood out in my mind the most is how much you feel for the main character, Larka . You really get inside her and go through the book as if ou were there with her. The book is about a pack of wolves who are cursed by an evil wolf. One of the wovles discovers she has the sight, which is part of an ancient proficey(?). The novel shows how the proficey develops and how the wolves struggle. I would recommend this book for older children because it is a very harsh novel. ALso check out the author's other book, ""Firebringer."""
1,Homeopathic but requires prescription?,"Homeopathic ""medicine"" is made by vastly diluting ingredient(s) to the point of statistically not having even a single molecule of those original ingredient(s) left (to a extremely high probability). It is absolutely 100% safe...Given that this requires a prescription would make me think it is not Homeopathic.And even if it is Homeopathic medicine it has no scientifically supported means of effectiveness and scientific studies in general show no effect beyond placebo.To learn more look up homeopathy on Wikipedia."
2,"Good info, just hard to find","This book contains several helpful suggestions, but be prepared to flip around quite a bit to find them. If you're looking for help for a 0-6 month old in particular, the information you need is not well organized. In addition, the examples provided by the author tend to describe extreme sleep issues, not the middle ground."
4,Not just for the holidays,"This is an excellent 9 track mini-album. Though the theme is Christmas, I find that, unlike a typical holiday album, it works just as well in the middle of the summer. The topics are really more just insightful observations on life, loosely connected with the holidays. Compared to ""A Week Away"", I would say that the songs here are overall not quite as strong, but if you are a fan of Spearmint you won't be disappointed. My favorite song here is ""I Went Away""."
2,Not what we expected,To us this CD was not worth the cost. To many of the hymns were only 1 or 2 verses and none were the entire hymn.
3,Not as good as the other two in the trilogy,"I had been waiting patiently (sometimes unpatiently) for the third book of this trilogy. I absolutly loved My Steadfast Heart and My Reckless Heart, but this one just wasn't as good. I didn't like Berkey and Grey like I ABSOLUTLY LOVED Colin and Mercedes and LOVED Decker and Jonna almost as much. The book didn't have much depth and a few times I didn't understand where the story was going. Although, if you are a fan of this series, it is a MUST READ!"
5,I love it!!,"I had this when it first came out on 8 track . I had it for 5yrs. and it broke and I about cried! Tiny Tim has a beautiful voice. FOR about 20 yrs. or more I've been looking for it and then I found it only here at amazon! I thank all of you at amazon for this.I can't wait for it to get at my house, I am so excited to finely get to hear it again. I've been driveing my wife crazy with humming Tip Toe Through the Tulips. Thanks amazon thanks so much ! You don't know how much this means to me."
4,For those of us who have been living in a cave,"Sun O))) gives this world of weak humans something beautiful; most of us will never properly grasp such beauty. Unless you're familiar with the sort of elitist soundscapes created by outfits like Lustmord and Pan Sonic, you won't understand the amazing things some of these ""metal"" guys are capable of doing. You'll just have to take a leap and liten. Black One takes all the accepted cliches and throws them out of the window. Cookie-monster vocals are the only cue as to where these guys come from, aside from that it's a long, long way off from your burnout older brother's Venom LPs. The fellows in Sunn O))) own and operate Southern Lord, which is host to many other talented and original bands, most of which I'm planning to check out, as I am new to this particular renaissance.Great makeout tunes for the kind of evening that ends in tragedy."
3,Preview of Books 6 and 7?,"Well darn it, isn't anybody going to review this thing?!The wordcount drags the pace down just a bit too far -- there wasn't enough of the energy of Vols. 3 and 4 or the humor of the earlier volumes to give the needed ""lift"".Several expected plot developments skittered across the pages like sheep being trotted past an insomniac, but were pulled out of the line-up before they had covered any ground. If Rowling was attempting to pace herself going slow on plot resolution and character development, I think she has bought time at too high a price.However, look out for one or two promising new characters, and enjoy a little more detail on Sirius' character -- poor guy hasn't had much of a chance in previous books, what with all the plot device work he's been called on to perform! And then, sit back and hope that the sheep are about to be followed by sweeter dreams."
5,words cannot express what a great album this is,"i believe that the date was february 23rd, for the past month or two i had done nothing but bug all my friends about what was going to happen february 23rd, and when the day finally came i left the school parking lot as quick as possible and broke speed barriers to get to my local music store. when i left and anxiously slipped the cd into my pioneer i was far from dissappointed. Things Fall Apart is simply the best hip hop cd in years. from the intro all the way to the hidden track, it is top notch hip hop. u can just tell by listening to the lyrics and the thought that the music is being played with (god forbid) live instruments that a lot of hard work went into making this album, and we, the fans, have been so generously awarded."
3,The Power of Good-bye,I am not the worlds biggest madonna fan or anything...I mean I like her music but the one song 1 song on her new album I absolutely love is the Power of Good-bye. This song puts me in the best mood....Im not realyl sure why but I just love it!
2,Not quite what I expected,"I thought the instructor (Christy Lane) was very enthusiastic and knowledgeable, but I thought the dance instruction would include going through the dance with the associated music. Instead, the instructor goes through the dance moves slowly, then she goes through them at regular speed, then she does a (very) short run through to music. Granted, some steps (eg. Electric Slide) are not complicated, but I guess I was expecting more time to be spent on each separate dance."
1,May God forgive us,"May God forgive us for even publishing a piece of garbage like this. To call this ""God's Word"" is unthinkable. This trash does not even remotely resemble a ""bible"". It is awful even for a paraphrase. Even a paraphrase is supposed to come close to saying what the original translation tried to convey. This is New Age double speak. Verses are twisted so far out of context that they are not recognizable. I am not talking about manuscripts or literal vs. dynamic translations. This goes beyond a bad manuscript or a bad translation approach. This story book is not supported in the biblical Greek or Hebrew at all. If you truly need an easier-to-read English translation of the Bible, try the New Century Version or NLT. Don't even get one of these if it is free. Mine went in the trash."
5,Bravo to Phillips for this wonderful series,"Not only am I delighted with this enchanting compilation but with the lullabies for lovers, chopin and champagne, beethoven for readers and bedtime. The list goes on. It is rare for compilations to pull off the cover promise but this series does from the upbeat mozart for breakfast and commuting to the soulfull and truly tranquil Debussy for Daydreaming I am overjoyed with each CD I have purchased. If you love classical music or would like to then this series is a treasure and great way to experience the best of the best"
2,Confused...,"As a fan of both the Merry Gentry and Anita Blake series, I was very disappointed. Not only was this book lacking a proper plot in my opinion (what happened to Merry's career?) but I felt no connection with any of the new characters (had trouble keeping track of most of them) and no reconnection to the old characters (MORE DOYLE PLEASE!)Of course if you are a true Hamilton fan it is a must read, but I suggest you wait for the paperback."
3,Rex's Review,"A Walk to Remember is a book about a young man, Landon Carter, who, without knowing it, falls in love with the preacher's daughter. Jamie Sullivan, the preacher's daughter, is an unlikely match for Landon, but nonetheless a sweet likeable young lady. This is a classic love story, the boy (Landon) unwillingly falls in love with the girl (Jamie), the girl gets sick and his world seems as if it is falling apart. I felt Sparks' foreshadowing was a little overdone because I could predict what was going to happen throughout the entire novel. For some it was a tearjerker, as for me it was not. I liked the book and would recommend it to others, but I do not think I would ever want to read it again."
1,Sad state of black books,"I wish I could do negative stars. Zora, James, Langston are spinning in their graves. And I bet the younger generation thinks this is great? Even if this garbage is tongue in cheek, I'd rather my kids (17 and 22) play video games or read Sports magazines all day than this mess."
4,enjoy reading about the resistance,"as usual Ken Follett delivers a great story. I especially enjoyed the fact that women played a great part this time--and not the barbie, bimbo, or subservant wife types."
5,Gloria Estefan - Live in Miami,This is subtitled and terrific! I wasn't sure if it was subtitled - but it did come with subtitles. Was very happy about it.
5,Get to know what Life is all about . . . before it's out!,"Akin to Hugh Prather's NOTES TO MYSELF, Kay Anderson's I AND THOU in the HERE AND NOW offers positive capsules of optimism from an awakened and enlightened consciousness. If you feel alone and confused about the way human friction and fears torment us through life, this is the book to read. Ms Anderson writes: Life can be beautiful if we care enough about ourselves and others. Either we go forward, or we go backward."" It's a gret UPPER!"
3,Not a Classic,"This wasn't as great as I was expecting at all actually, there are some strong tracks on it, but overall, it's considerably weak. I agree with the reviewer that said Nas is better. His lyrics don't really focus on anything in my opinion, he just kinda jumps around talking about nothing in particular, at least that's the way it seems to be. This is just average. Nothing on it really sticks with me, with the exception of Moment Of Clarity and Dirt off Your Shoulders, which I think are the best tracks on here. 3 stars"
3,Neat book,"Bought this to widen my selection of dishes I know. Living overseas in a western country made it harder to get some of the ingredients but seeing the beautiful pictures and using replacement flavours allowed me to cook up nice little dishes for the family. Great way to ease the homesickness too! My only problem is the 'bone' of the book, it came apart on the first attempt of me looking through the pages, and I was being very gentle too! Overall neat little book to have."
5,A Brox Tale,"The movie was fine. Since a duplicate was received as a gift, VERY disappointed in the lack of response from seller, californiamedia09 for not responding to my refund request. Package never opened.Request ignored twice!"
4,Good product - Packed poorly,"The machine itself is of decent quality, a bargain for the price. The company however has basicly no internal packing material in the box and the box itself is thin cardboard which is not appropriate for such a heavy item. The box was destroyed by the time it reached my house and I can't blame the shipping company. The machine itself suffered damage on 5 parts in shipping. I have yet to call the company for replacement parts."
4,great buy for your handycam,I purchased this for my Sony Handycam DCR-DVD108. Its a great case overall but I have just one gripe. It has barely enough space for all of the cords and cables that come standard with the camera. I have to carry my extra discs seperate because the space is a little tight. Other than that it is a great case.
1,First time Slingo-player,"After reading the glowing reviews that this Slingo game received, I purchased it a short while ago .... and boy was I disappointed! Not only are the graphics poor, but it is very hard to read; I was constantly turning the screen back and forth to see what angle gave the best view, but the contrast was so bad, it just became annoying over time.No real brain strain... I can't see why some would find this educational... you are just making random choices, barely any strategy involved. Stick with Yahtzee or something similar, at least you have to use some math with that one. I didn't find Slingo to be much fun at all and would rather play tic-tac-toe or checkers before resorting to playing Slingo again.I don't know how durable this toy is since I'm not going to play it anymore - but, it didn't fall apart in the short time I had it. Even though this game is probably fun for kids, grown-ups might enjoy Battleship or Yahtzee a lot more."
1,this game is good BUT THE SIMS 2 IS WAY BETTER,"THE GRAPHICS ARE BETTER, YOU MAY PLAY VIDEO GAMES, MORE ITEMS,AND MORE BUILDING TOOLS.THE SIMS 2 IS BETTER........."
5,very reliable and affordable,"I got frustrated with my 2 radioshack chargers: rs 23-427 (the wallwart version), as they would harldy ever charge my NiMH bats to full capacity.I use the ZTS pulse-load battery tester for this, as el-cheapo capacity indicators suck: they report the voltage, which relation to remaining charge is too subtle to be useful for us.Using the MH-C204F batteries 80-90% of the time get charged to 100%, the remainder to 80% of full capacity. I have had it for 6 months now and it's a gem.Indeed, the undocumented flashing red light seems to indicate a bad battery. On that basis I've tossed about 2 pair of AAA bats of weird brands (like ""TWD"" 700 mAh).I highly recommend this brand and charger!TIP: even though some discourage this, I keep my bats frozen until needed. NiMH self-discharge rate at room temp is rather high. No probs thusfar, and always 80-100% charge."
2,The Killers need to go back to Vegas,"I had to listen to this one several times before making up my mind. The Killers have shown a new face, which isn't a bad thing, but it doesn't connect with their old face at all. In Hot Fuss, the songs were great and the melodies easy to pick out and sing along with. In Sam's Town, Flowers can't seem to find his own melody. His pitches are all over the map and they don't seem to blend with what the rest of the band is doing. It is a unique style that might be okay for one or two tracks, but a whole CD? The Killers have indeed lost their 'Killers' edge, and I hope it comes back for round three. Definitely preview it before you buy it, or you'll be upset at throwing away 15 bucks. I'm just glad I got away only paying $10. Whew!"
2,A flat story of a flat place.,The characters are not believable and the plot is is not engaging. It could be used in middle school for an atmospheric read of Florida in the 19th century.It is not challenging enough for serious readers or anyone who knows anything about Florida.
4,Great character study!,"This is a terrific book & you can't beat the price.After I read it, I got online and bought the rest of the trilogy."
3,Good but not great,"I learned alot from the information in this book, but since it didn't 'combine' all the things together in a normal way it's hard to use it in your own movies. Like said before in a review the chapters are all screwed up. If you're new to Flash 4 you'd be better off by taking the lessons. (Help>Lessons)"
2,umm.......,"Charlie who says about the Hilary stuff..... I have a couple things to say to you,1. Learn how to spell her name!2. Hilary is very talented and she is way more than Lindsay3. That may be your opinion but it's annoying!!Hilary Duff is awesome, she had gone more through Lindsay and she is still better than Lindsay... now I will stop hating Lindsay cause I like lindsay too.... she is a great actress but I have never bought her album.... I have listened to the album once and I was very dissapointed, since then I haven't... but in the other hand I have ALL Hilary's album.... she is very talented. But Anways I do like Lindsay it might not sound like it but I do! Lindsay and Hilary BOTH Rock!! but in my opinion I like Hilary way more!! P.S. YOU BOTH ROCK :-D"
4,Another very good cabot book.,"I didn't think I was going to like this book at first. I really didn't like some of the characters, namely ross and georgiana. But after i got use to the bickering etc. in the beginning, and once Payton and Drake were on the ship, I loved it. I have not been disapointed yet with Ms. Cabot. She is on my must buy list."
5,BEAUTIFUL!,I loved it so much! Bear and Bo are the best and this album proves it! Needtobreathe are an awesome band and I am glad that God has given them this talent and I am glad they use it!
5,Best Shredder Yet,"We do a lot of shredding in our home and I was going to call the mobile shredder to come out and handle our old boxes of papers dating back 6 years. Instead, we ordered this shredder for the same cost as the mobile shredder and it worked fast and furiously to get the job done! It's quiet and quick. I even accidentally put in some paperwork from the vet that had a metal rabies tag and s-ring attached to it, and the shredder kicked it back out. I thought after that the shredder would die, but it kept going. It did have to stop for a ""break"" every 30 minutes or so, but that's because we were really taxing it. It was quite the trooper, though, the miserable task was over in no time and we still sing the praises of this shredder. I don't think you are going to find a better one on the market and the price is unbeatable. Oh, and it has a guard on it to protect little hands, very important in our home with two little ones."
2,"Too sweet, not masculine","Being a huge fan of Carlos Santana, I had to try the cologne. The fragrance is much too sweet and blossom like. This is not a light cologne, so the strong statement is not a good one for me. It has a nice hint of musk and if the sweet smell was backed way off, I think it would be very nice. Sorry Carlos, I wish I could support you on this one."
3,Big disappointment in its Web integration,"I recently moved to Mac OS X from Windows 2000. This is one of my first Mac OS X application. First, it's a disappointment that this is not Cocoa-based. Instead its Carbon-based and hence, the dialog looks poor on Mac OS X especially when you view it at very high resolution screen. The fonts are just so tiny. And worse, there is no way you can change the font for the registry.I use online banking a lot and its online banking is ok if you're connecting to Quicken server or if your bank has Quicken support. However, for those bank that use Web interface, the integration is terrible. You'd have to use your browser to download the QFX file manually and then import the transaction that way. It's more integrated in Windows."
5,Black Beauty = Smoky,"This is one of the best books that I have ever read. When I first checked it out of the library I thought it might be a boring book, but I was wrong. This book is a real page-turner. The grammar may be horrible, but it adds to the setting, and it makes you feel like you're actually in the old west. Will James did a great job with the characters too. It makes you feel like you know the characters, and you feel what they're feeling and everything. It is a layered book that is similar to Black Beauty, and if you liked that story, you will definitely like this. You may not have even liked Black Beauty, but if you like horses, stories of the old west, Spaghetti Westerns, and anything of the sort, you will definitely love this book. It keeps you on your toes, always wondering what will happen next. Will James wrote this book very well, and it deserved a newbery medal, five stars, ten out of ten, 100%, and I really think a movie should be made about it."
3,Demille fails to pull it off!,"I chose this book because I had heard of the movie and appeared to be an excellent thriller. In fact I found the plot boring. There was no intensity or suspense. The novel makes an attempt at romance but fails in convincing the reader of the whole affair. I read the entire novel waiting to find out who did it, but the story ended unsatisfying and with my questions unanswered. The interactions and interogations of people kept my interest. Also, I was intrigued by the characters in their descriptions and personalities. A descent read but unsatisfying."
4,I love it,"I originally got into Big Sir because of Pet, a band featuring two of the members that now comprise this group. Of those two members, one is the vocalist, Lisa Papineau, who is close to the most compelling lyricist and singer I've ever come across. Although Pet was more along the lines of metal-alternative-whatever, the LA-based Big Sir has a lot of trip hop to their songs, which is currently my favorite genre of music abreast trance techno.This is an intelligent remix album featuring a variety of charismatic interpretations. For example, ""Fuzak"" has a harder hip hop element fused into the chorus that works (completely). My makeshift favorite is ""g7"" but this release definitely possesses the strength required for repeated start-to-finish playings. If you are into variety, pick this up."
5,My most comfortable casual shoe,"I had never tried Crocs until my sister spied a kiosk in the mall and told me I needed to try them on last year. I bought two pair, and the capri thongs I wear everywhere sandals are allowed. My feet don't even feel like I'm wearing shoes, and they give me such amazing support for standing still and walking. I lost them on a kayaking trip last month and could not find my size anywhere buy Amazon.com due to the lateness of the season. I was like a kid at Christmas when they arrived, and I was only without them for a week."
4,Love the stargate series,"Love the Stargate series, however the earlier seasons are the better. The original cast has been great, and I did miss Daniel Jackson the year he was off the show."
5,soldier's Heart sole my heart,SOLDIER'S HEARTSoldier's Heart is about a kid named Charley he was 15 years old .He went to Fort Summter and signed up. He was in the Civil War.I think Gary Paulsen is trying to show us that war is all about and to teach us war is not cool or fun.I liked the whole book but my favorite parts were when two bullets headed for his head but they hit each other and fell. I also liked when a canon ball went though a horse and it did flips. I liked the end because it's peaceful. If you want to find out what happens red it you will love it.
1,refrain,"If you like this music then you need your head checked, although your probably busy watching MTV. We competed with them at Battle of the Bands in high school, seems to me they are still stuck there. Bitter? Yes. Just show you what connections can get you in life. I feel sorry for Jordon, he doesn't deserve it. The girl that caused the song was nothing special either. Psst! Hey Clutch, tell Throttle I said what up. By the way 1 star is way too much."
4,"so far, so good....","It's hard to fully assess this stuff yet, but so far, with use of about 2 weeks, I am seeing a difference with that ugly black fungus that I am getting on my toenails. How the stuff began I do not know...what I do know is that I want it to go away and I'll try this for a while before considering oral medication from a podiatrist..."
1,Awful recording quality,"I used this headset to record narrated powerpoint presentations and webinars, and while it picks up my voice well, it also picks up EVERY SINGLE background sound, including any creaks and groans within the headset itself. If the cord its the table it records as a little clatter. If the microphone slips a little, it creaks at top volume. Awful."
4,Definately gives you a workout!,My daughter is pretty good at this game. It might take me a while to get used to this one. One thing for sure is that it really gives you a workout!
5,Cool Celtic Coolfin!,"Heard this on NPR's Thistle and Shamrock and knew I needed this for the collection. One of those rare albums where all the tracks are worth listening to! Some great tracks with slow and fast complex rhythms played together that make these guys worth their musical weight. Includes a track featuring Eddi Reader, another favorite of mine... Definitely worth a listen to if you like the traditional Celtic instruments played alongside the modern in a contemporary Celtic fashion. Will certainly be on the lookout for more albums from this group!"
3,Not as New-Looking as Expected,"I bought this book new, but it was a little beat-up (mainly the front flap). I was just expecting a product that didn't appear worn at all."
3,"Comfy, but too soft","As a side sleeper, I think this pillow is way too soft. I find myself fluffing it in the middle of the night and I usually sleep through everything. I've been sleeping on it for two weeks now, and have yet to notice a difference in my neck pain. I won't give up on it yet, though! If you prefer a softer pillow, I would recommend this one."
1,Comic book style is awful. Very disappointed!,I didn't realize this book was written like a comic. I loved the other CSI books that were written in the traditional style. The comic style is so much harder to read. I am truly disappointed in this purchase.
1,Model 950CB or 971LM are for older Security+ Openers,Note this unit did not work for me. I called Chamberlain and they said this unit is for older security + units that operate at 390 and the newer models like the one I purchased HD200D operate on 315 frequency. For newer units that use 315 the correct remote is the 371LM or 950D
1,Mrs. Brown's 4th Grade Class,Surviving the applewhitesBy Stephene S. TolanIn this book there is a 13 year old boy who gets in a lot of trouble. He finaly gets put in the last school that's willing to take him. He is placed in the Creative Acadamy. I found this book boring because it was hard to understand and there was too many details. I recommend this book for middle school and up.
5,High Praise For Come Joy!,"This work is definitely a book you must read over and over. I have several favorites, including, ""Meditation"", ""My Love is a Song"", and all the ones describing the author's great love for family and special frienships. The title piece in the final chapter on the spiritual relationship with the Creator, is also a favorite, and Ms. Wynn's earnest invocation of the Spirit throughout is evidence of the connection she desires to make and maintain in sharing the gift she's been blessed with. The poems in the collection minister to the soul in different ways, encouraging and instructing, edifying and uplifting and especially in the soft of my own nights, these poem confirm what the heart has always known. There is joy in the morning. A must read for people who enjoy good literature that speaks to the heart."
1,No Windows 7 support (and in no hurry to provide any),"It takes alot of nerve to continue to sell a product that will not work on the latest and widely accepted version of Windows. It's not like Win 7 just came out last month, and there should be enough similarity between 7 and Vista in terms of driver architecture that creating a driver for this should not have been a problem. M-Audio apparently does not want to invest in providing drivers for anything but their most expensive products, so if you have Win 7 or believe you may anytime in the foreseeable future, look for hardware from a company that will actually support its own products. FAIL."
2,Melt down,"I'm hoping I won't have the same problem as the other reviewer, but I'm dreading the worst. I bought my first one three days ago, charged it, loaded it took it on a road trip and it froze 10 min into the trip. I returned it today and got a new one. Here's crossing my fingers.....This first part of the review was written the first week of January. I guess the date of the post changes when you edit it.Further update 1/20/07 .... Don't buy this. It doesn't hold a charge at all. Dies within 1-2 hours at *best.* I don't even use it much and the display keeps fritzing out. I don't really care about seeing the images, but it doesn't bode well for what's going on with the rest of it.1/25/07 Well, the second one died about a week after I got it and that's it no more - I'll get something else. I can't seem to change my ""star"" rating any more, but I'd give it a negative value."
3,Probably break easily,"As the previous reviewer said, these don't dangle freely, that is, they are actually attached to the back and don't move. This probably means that they will break easily. I bought these on sale (60% off), so they're probably worth about that much, as they are pretty, like the picture, and have a nice feel to them. I would still wear them, but I would be a lot more cautious than normal. For $25, you can buy nicer stuff at the store."
3,It was a disappointment for me.,"I didn't like 'The Catcher in the Rye' a lot. Though there were a few good things I admired. The reason I dislike it, is because I can't compare myself with the 16-year old boy, who is feeling depressed all the time. I feel sorry for him that he has such a lousy life. But it's basically his own fault: he makes a mess of his life the whole time and he doesn't take anything serious. He just spends his parents' money. And I find it really pathetic that his only real friend is his sister! The use of language is always the same:he uses a lot of negative words. And the whole book is about 4days, it is way to detailed. And that gets boring after a while. The only positive thing I can say about it, is that I admire the fact that it was written in 1950 and still a lot of young people can compare themselves with it. So it's not the fact that I hate reading novels, but this one was just a disappointment for me."
2,No lyrics attached... be very careful...,Beautifully arranged.. but no lyrics sheet.. I have to download some of the lyrics over the net to enjoy the CD... no regrets however.. The company should put an extra effort on their next venture... beware buyers... if you don't have the lyrics sheet.. it's impossible for you to cherish this cd..
4,DC Doom..l.a. style,"This cd is really good,its solid.If anyone has heard of ""Wino"",should already have heard or know of this now defunct band.This is the second record(The Evil In you And Me being the first).This came out when a time the alt.rock had the take over and that scene threw the baby out with the bathwater(anything remotely heavy was a real no-no).Lost Breed was a sword for the other side(along with the obsessed,cathedral,etc).All in all at the end of the day,its worth owning,and definately worth playing at a LOUD volume with a F@#k you attitude.RIP guys!!"
2,"Another Quickie ""Thriller""","If you're sitting in an airport or on the beach and need a distraction, go ahead and buy this book. But it really is a waste of time. The characters are flat, the plot is far less than thrilling and even the word craft is less than expected from this author (hey - does the President's 11-year-old daughter have to repeatedly 'flounce' out of the room?) Much like Tom Clancy has opted to put his name on second-rate books that he didn't write, Edge Of Honor seems to be a book that was quickly slapped together, relying on character development originated in previous novels.This is a waste of time & money."
2,"Quality Subject, Poor Film","The democratization of film making has led to a number of documentaries with great subjects made by sub par directors. I wish I could share the enthusiasm of the previous reviewers, but I found this narrative felt like a bad soap opera from the 1980s. It felt like the director was trying to impose the story on the viewer and stretch the length of the film to a running time that would allow it to be shown in theaters. I only wonder what it would have looked like under more capable hands, like Errol Morris or Frederick Wiseman. They would have at least been able to draw out aspects of the lives of this extended family other than a second-rate Shakespearean tragedy."
2,Technical but not great,"This was the first (and probably last) Meshuggah album I bought.This music is all a technical display and really isn't thatmusical. And most of the ""technical"" is a naive (boring) displayof some Jazz technique (chords, rhythym). The new Metallicaalbum is way better than anything Meshuggah can produce (probablywhy they sold > 1 million copies in a week? ...)Generally, the technical aspects of music are really just theunderlying mechanics and not much else. This group soundslike they're practicing for the real thing (as many of thethousands of Heavy Metal bands sound !)"
2,"middle "" western"" music..........","I just listened and in fact bought this cd ..I am originally from Middle East but I really did not like this cd..Because first of all this is not real middle eastern music..this is almost middle western!! music..I love and listen to middle eastern music a lot but with this album I could not find the taste of middle eastern music...where is ""darbuka"" at this cd??if you want some real ,authentic middle eastern music go listen to Burhan Ocal from Turkey...Arabandi from israel...Hossam Remzi from Egypt..the thing is it is not so easy to blend real ethnic music with modern jazz or dance...Most bands or single musicians fail to do that..One of the few who manages to create something valuable is Dj Cheb Sabbah .."
3,Ameristep 814 Tangle Camo Doghouse Blind,"Does the job but not the ""tuffest"" construction you will find but for the price... not bad!"
3,Read A Good Book On The Subject Instead,"Everyone gets wet over the opening sequence to this movie. Well, there are two problems with it for your consideration:1) It is a totally unrealistic account of the amount of time it took to win the battle of Normandy. To watch this crap, you'd think that the allies took the German positions in fifteen minutes!2) This sequence has NOTHING to do with the rest of the movie! You could actually remove it, and the rest of the film would not be affected.By the way, Robert Rodat's script sucks, too. Witness that awful Ed Burns dialogue before the final battle. Also, what's up with ""Earn this""? No one in the history of the world has ever uttered a sentence like that! Total crap."
1,"Purchased directly from Forzieri, Florence","Not knowing Amazon sold Fontanelly bags, I purchased mine directly from Forzieri, Florence, Italy.What a disappointment. The leather looks like black plastic. The lining is some kind of leather imitation. The pull on the zipper was missing.The bag was supposed to be brand new.I don't know if Amazon reviews or sees the products they advertise. I do not recommend this bag to anybody unless they like a cheap looking plastic bag.Never again.NKPS: Again I want to make clear I did not purchase this bag through Amazon, but directly from Italy."
5,good job,"good product, packaged and shipped properly. I like doing business with this company. I will do it again. yes. yes."
5,Great!,I own the darker hue powder and it's fantastic. It really adds body to hair and cuts any extra oil. It has a fresh lemony scent and great texture. Since I have really long wavy hair a spray on/comb-through formula just wouldn't work as well for me; the powder formula lets you really have control where you use it. I have not used it on my body but as a hair powder I would recommend it.
1,What magazine,Hard to rate this subscription cause I Have not received anything yet. No magazine or even a account number so I can view it on my tablet.
4,Excellent!,"I totally loved it! It was beautiful! There were only 2 things that I didn't like in the entire thing. 1. Michael Crawford wasn't there (sniff sniff) 2. Antonio Banderas singing phantom, he sounds good, but that accent is just not right. And, did everyone hear what ALW said, about a continuation of Phantom of the Opera? I'd heard rumors of that but I didn't belive them, I hope it's good."
2,Appropriate name,"I love Bowie, but the music in Tin Machine is just so... harsh. Tin Machine is an appropriate name for it, more so than, say, heavy metal. I can easily listen to Heavy Metal, rock, hard rock, etc. but this stuff almost hurts my ears. It is not an easy listen, I'm afraid to say.Still, for hard core Bowie fans, You'll probably want to hear it at some point."
1,This thing should not be sold,"I read the mixed reviews of this device, but felt that my use was over such a short distance and so far within the posted specifications that it would work for me. I was wrong. I tried a variety of placements of both the sender and the receiver and tried several reomtes. They hardly worked at all, when they did transmit the signal I had to hold the remote about an inch from the sending unit. One of the other reviews said that this device should not be sold. I agree,it should not be on the market."
3,Weight consistent...other measurements not,"The company was late in shipping. If you like gadgets, it's fun; but I question the accuracy. In three days' time -- weight remained steady (darn), water reduced 6%, and body fat went up over 5%??? I don't think so!"
5,Not many re-makes have turned out this good !,"A very good movie with some tongue-in-cheek humor. I have always enjoyed this movie, and would highly reccomend it to all."
2,A mish-mash of Balkan history,"André Gerolymatos is a professor at Simon Fraser University. How would he grade his own book? The facts are there - but... He seems to jump back and forth a thousand years in a single sentence. Not very helpful in understanding what happened, or what is happening... Professor, this is a C- job.For anyone wanting to understand the Balkans (at least Bosnia, and the effects of the Turkish rule in the ""former Yugoslav"" area) I would recommend, unfortunately, not this book but a Nobel Prize winning novel: ""Bridge on the Drina"" by Ivo Andric (Nobel Laureate for Literature, 1960, I believe)."
5,Extraordinary Film,"When Laurence Olivier introduced this film at the midnight screening in London he said: ""It is the best ensemble acting since Citizen Kane."" After seeing this film today I couldn't agree more. Astonishing performances by Ben Gazzara, George Peppard, Pat Hingle, Mark Richman (The Strange One was their film debut!) and brilliant direction by Jack Garfein."
3,Incomplete Soundtrack,"Besides enjoying the movie, I especially liked the track with the first love scene of Sonny (Colin Farrell) and Isabella (Gong Li). I would replay my DVD just to hear that fabulous song (""Shape of Things to Come"" by Audioslave on ""Revelations"" CD). That song intensified the episode and enhanced the film. Omitting that track is similar to watching the DVD of the Ben-Hur procession of chariot riders and, after listening to the CD, feeling ripped off at not having that music included. I also did not care for the random listing of the tracks which did not follow the screenplay action. Michael Mann has a reputation for wanting close to perfection in his projects. He produced this CD; he could have done a better job."
3,Follow Me Boys.,"Should be region 0 or 2, but was 1. Should also be PAL, but was NTSC.Otherwise OK, it replaces my old Betamax copy."
5,Confirms What Everyone Already Knows,"...That Lennon was a great wordsmith as well as musician. In a perfect world, he would be getting ready to celebrate his Medicare b'day of age 65 next month instead of 25 years since his death in December because some deranged loser wanted notoriety.Thank heavens we have him in print as well as in song to enjoyfor years to come"
3,Your on your own,"Rule number 1: Update the firmware.. without the update, the device is brain-dead.Rule number 2: Forget support: an email describing my problems (brain-deadness) went unanswered for 2 weeks, by then I had fumbled to my own cure.One might think a device like this might arrive with the latest firmware, not stuff more than two years old.Device is functional as advertised not withstanding a bad taste left by D-link support."
5,Works Great,Works Great easy to install built to last glad i bought it nice value came fast like the color also
3,Which song from the Chi-Lites??,Decent album...does anyone know which Chi-Lites song is sampled for the horns in Crazy in Love? Thanks for the help.
4,Great listen .,I really enjoyed this novel. Read it as an audible and looked for ways I could find a time to continue to listen .
4,The food Journal of Lewis & Clark,"I checked this book out of a libary in Colorado that was just a little better, meaning the paper was more interesting. It was soft, thick, with an old book edge to the paper. This one I received is just fine, same print but the paper had been changed. Good but not like the one in Colorado which must have been an early printing. Great idea in the content of this book and the way all things come together."
3,Excellent Academic Writing,Seems to be excellent academic writing from someone who doesn't know about real magic.
3,Decent commercial comeback,"This is a nice album, but I'm not a huge fan of this kind of production. The melodies are strong, give SAW that! It's late 80's techno-pop, but like I said the melodies are nice and there's some very good tunes here. My favourite is Breakaway. Donna's voice isn't the same as it was in her earlier career, it's changed a bit, it's deeper. This is good music."
1,Something is wrong here!,"I saw the writings by Chokyi Nyima and Tulku Urygen. Two great teachers and worth something.So II open the book and see a quote by Sogyal Rinpoche (page x) along with a lot of editorializing by Schmidt about the ignorance of the world. Then the book opens to another quote, ""Those who follow the path of lust cannot attain the great way..""And I remember that Sogyal Rinpoche was sued by his female students for improper sexual advances, including having them do strip teases, etc..And I see writings of Chogyam Trungpa, the alcoholic who made new students strip in front of a group, among many other things.I think it's time for a valid, honest people's spirituality which does not demean others and is not hypocritical. Reject those who purvey something which looks like the devil's rear end, if you pardon the Christian image."
1,Don't waste time or money on this!,"From the time she began to crawl, our daughter could defeat this. She would either pull it out and away from the VCR, or push the buttons through the plastic. (not stable, no way to keep it in place, etc.) We finally broke down and got an entertainment center with doors that we could hide all the electrical equipment in, returned these and bought locks for the cabinet doors."
3,Well built but definitely not 5 star,"All exposed parts are metal and the fan seems to be solid. The switches function smoothly like a quality product. For all practical purposes the noise from the fan is not much different than other fans. Two jets flying overhead is not much different than one jet flying overhead in terms of their effect on your life. If you want to direct the air from the fan toward the ceiling or to move air up a stairwell, this is not the fan for you. It has VERY limited elevation adjustment. The fan can be set to remain stable or oscillate over an 85 degree range. There is no intermediate setting."
4,Great pictures,If you love antique or vintage things this book is great. The stories and pictures in the book are so fun to look at. It also looks great out for Halloween time on the table. Everyone likes to look at it. Would recommend.
2,4.5 Star rating,This headset is uncomfortable to wear but if you heat the earpiece and bend it outwards and back it will fit just fine. You can also go to an eyewear store and have them do it for you.As for the performance it is great. I drive truck and have a lot of background noise and windows are usually down partially and everyone has no problems hearing and understanding me and I can hear them just fine also. The volume is great and at times I have to turn it down in volume. Have tried the AnycomHS-890 and this outperforms it hands down. Have had it drop my phone on occasion but never during a call where the Anycom would at any time. I would definitely reccommend this headset to anyone in a noisy environment. Very satisified with the performance. Tried to change the rating and seems like can't do that once the review is written. Amazon needs to fix the edit system on this.
4,Good workout,"I really like that you can choose the exercise level that best suits you. The movements are clear and easy to follow, and you can change levels as your strength increases to challenge yourself more."
2,Disposable phone,Might as well have gone into toys r us and gotten a better toy phone in there! The keypad started cracking not long after I got it. It sucks.
1,"oooh, hollwoods at its greatest !! BEST MOVIE EVER","syke. yeah - i said syke. cause this movie sucked. i love how it referenced to parts of american psycho part 1 that didnt even exist - and that it actually conflicted with the original film. take some director with an almost recognizable spin off of a famous name (morgan J freeman) - mix him in with 20 days of filming and a budget of 3 million dollars - put it straight to video and then throw in some hollywood magic (ie blood, underlying messages to women, and captain kirk) and there you have it."
1,Strictly for fans of academic Political Correctness,"If you like Star Trek, you will probably hate this book. It drones on for what seems like forever in an academic time warp of jargon and irrelevancies. For readers interested in the background history of the original Star Trek series, this is NOT the best book to read. Many other histories of the series are far better. For readers who do not consider race to be a ""social contruct"" but rather a biological reality underpinning a social superstructure, this book will be infuriating."
2,"Very weak narrative, but some nice takes",The narrative is very weak up to the point of being embarrassed for those who wrote it.. But--the takes are nice and it gives a pretty comprehensive overview of what the exercise is all about.
4,Really Sick,"Sartre is a world famous existentialist of the times, and I think this wonderful novel really brings precision to the word ""absurd"". Objects are not what they seem... and physical sickness is due to his realisation of the absurdity of existence. What do you thinK??? READ THE BOOK."
5,AWESOME!,"This was one of my favorite subject's my dd took this year. It's a complete program, has great follow questions at the end of each section and rather interesting case studies to test the user's understanding of that chapters information. While the case studies are all religiously based, that one uses the syllogisms to prove or disprove, the information presented in the chapters is religiously neutral. We did not need the answer key for this book.My dd took a class at a local homeschooling co-op that did use the DVD series, but she said she hated the professor's speaking- she counted that he said ""um"" 16 times in one section once and had long pauses. You can't use just the DVD series to teach the material, but it is my understanding that you can use just the text.This material is useful for students 7th grade and older."
1,Great show bad DVD,The quality of this DVD is shocking.Even the titles are Blurred.I tried everything but it's just a poor copy. It's a shame because the concert (what I can see of it)is great.
3,Boz,"I am happy with the product. Even though it was a used book, it was complete without any pages missing or significant damage."
5,"Outstanding output, speed, and value","This printer set up easily and quickly, even to a very old PC running Windows 98. It prints quickly compared to other modern inkjet printers I've seen. Photographs print nicely on plain paper; I imagine the results on photo paper would be beautiful. Text is stunningly laser-crisp."
1,NOT a good workout!,"I am a belly dancer and I thought I might like this DVD because Hula is SO similar! I was looking forward to it but was very disappointed.DETAILS:I DID NOT like this ""workout"" at all. The first 10 minutes are fine - not bad at all. After that it becomes mundane and VERY BORING. It is VERY slow moving and yet . . . there is NOT ENOUGH CUEING.Since this is targeted to beginners the instructor should have BROKEN DOWN THE MOVES to make them understandable and more doable. She DOES NOT do this.MY SYNOPSIS:Beginners WILL get LOST and the more advanced will be BORED.This DVD did not hold my attention and was NOT it a good work out. I'm sorry. I have to say thumbs down! God bless."
4,A great bargain,"The Capresso 101.01 lives up to its promise of quick no hasstle expresso and steamed milk. Warming cycle is a bit of a bother, but not much really when considering the price and the performance of the machine. One key will be how well the coffee to steam switch on the left side stands up. Overall, a good bargain, and good expresso."
1,Incense that doesn't burn,Decided to try a new brand of incense......big mistake. Do not bother with this item. I light these incense sticks and they do not burn. It was a waste of money.
1,Think Twice,"I have had it with this tool. First I couldn't remove the cutter, the allen wrench actually broke; then the cheap fence broke. The local PC repair shop replaced the entire tool. Now one year later, I can't remove the cutter again. Poor design; shame on PC. Buy the Lamello."
1,Didnt last three months very disappointed,The charger worked great for the first three months my grandson comes to my home every wednesday and he drives his powerwheels truck so the charger was used once a week after about three months the battery was not charged so I took the truck and charger in to the powerwheels service center the guy tested everything and determined it was the charger. So now I just charge the truck the day before and my grandson only gets to ride until the battery dies as it takes 14 hours to recharge
1,very misleading,I was sad so see the version I received was a French copy. The movie is still in English but it's not what is being advertised. The only reason I have not returned the item is because it took so long to arrive in the first place
3,Just another author trying baseball,"A fair read, amd written well because of special access to the A's while they were winning 20 in a row, but Lewis' soujourn into baseball seems contrived, as if Thomas Boswell or Roger Kahn spent a while writing about all-star mutual fund managers. I enjoyed it, but I really got such a rush from Lewis' other works that I hope he goes back to where he really stands out. Dozens of sportswriters could have done this book, maybe with a little less style, but done it nonetheless."
5,A Classic Work,"A good, logical discussion of the Bible passages pertaining to women. Even tho this old work takes the premise that the Bible actually has some historicity to it (there is a very poor correlation to actual history and archaeology), it shows just how illogical and misogynistic the male interpretation of woman's role is. It also shows how totalitarian the morals are shown to be in the Bible. Like Mark Twain's writings on the same subject but without any concentration on woman's role, the Bible does not stand up well to any logical analysis.The brainwashed true believers who never let logic, evidence, or reason stand in the way of their authoritarian beliefs give this a 1 star. It would be interesting to do the same treatment with a 100 years additional information to add to the discussion. That would really anger the fundies."
3,Done in a rush....,"If you want a study guide to become a CCNA then this book offers more than you will actually need for the exam. But be warned about taking the practice exam. It might shake your confidence a bit. The score you get on the practice exams is often misleading. The exam itself needs a lot of editing. A lot of the items on the practice exam are gibberish. To make matters worst, it seems that no one bothered to publish an errata yet. An update on the practice exam is in order."
4,how to make random numbers,"Tezuka offers a pragmatic approach to the generation of random numbers in a uniform distribution. While there is certainly a decent amount of theory in his book, it is primarily for someone who needs to code a generator. And who might not be so concerned about understanding the underlying aspects of number theory.The book also offers various methods that show how to measure the random nature of its algorithms.For a broad theorectical framework, perhaps the earlier book by Donald Knuth, ""The Art of Computer Programming"", offers the best overview."
3,Wish it was more than shorts!,I probably would have passed on this item if I knew it was only a bunch of shorts edited together but I would recommend it to anyone trying to get a feel for the real punk scene.
1,where there is smoke there FIRE!,"I just bought this and opened it up. I thought it would be good as I have fine long hair.I used it for about 10 minutes and something popped and it sounded different - I looked inside and it was red hot and started smoking. It may have spit out sparks as I felt something hit my head. I thought, this thing is going to light my head on fire.It is brand new and it won't work.Everytime I turn it on it starts to heat up and smokes.I have a wonderful Revlon hair dryer that works great, so I thought it would be good. The one I have isn't ionic and wanted to try it, guess I'll go back to the old one.Don't buy it."
3,Not the best Stride Rite shoe,"We only purchase Stride Rite shoes due to our son having very wide feet, and generally love them. These ones make his feet smell, and I notice a different pair that looks very very similar (Harper Fisherman) does not.I looked at them closely and believe it's because the insole on this one is some type of material while the Harper insole is leather.They also gave him blisters on both feet and we have been having him wear socks with them to help heal the blisters.Overall, a decent shoe, but has some flaws."
1,Lame!,"I love psychological thrillers, but this is is not one of them. The ending sucked! Thats all I can say about it...Dont waste your money renting..."
4,High Quality. Durable,"Since we began caring for an ""outside"" cat last fall, I've been looking for something like this. While our winters in Florida aren't cold, they can get chilly. This unit is good-sized, fully insulated, and carpeted. Works well to shelter her from draughts. It holds the cat's bed with room to spare. Priced competitively, and the seller offered free shipping."
2,Too Vague,"I bought this book, spent an hour or two looking it over, and realized that I don't have the time to try and figure out how to apply what the author is trying to explain. I needed a true quick start book, with solid examples of applications. I brought it back and exchanged it for ""Fireworks, Fast & Easy Web Development"" by Lisa Lee. A much better book for someone who doesn't have a whole lot of time on their hands. It has solid examples of how to do things like create buttons, optimize images, etc., just what I needed."
1,Desert Noir,"Lovers of mystery are strongly advised to avoid wasting their time on this exericise in futility. This tale is full of contradictions, all the characters are flat and undeveloped, and the plot relies on coincidence. The so-called local color stretches the believability of anyone who actually lives in Arizona. The writing is at about a junior high level.One star is actually much too high a rating."
1,Now irrelevant,"Shaughnessy now has to find a different schtick; the Sox have won the World Series, and now we won't have to hear about made-up curses ever again. Go Sox!"
3,Somewhat Confusing,"We purchased this item for our daughter. She loves the unit and it works exceptionally well. The main dissatisfaction we have is navigating the menus. Trying to mark your current position as a favorite is rather convoluted. It would be better if there was a ""click here to add current location to favorites"" feature. Since we have not had the device for long...maybe there is and we just haven't found it. Other than that, once the locations are listed for favorites - the device is great and she is much more confident in her traveling."
2,Way Too Much Fluff,"Ordered this book hoping for a ""bible"" on essential oils. Instead, well over half the book is filled with stock photographs that only occasionally pertain to the text. Even if I ignore the ridiculous photos the actual text reads like advertising--barely any actual information surrounded by clouds and clouds of unhelpful fluff. If you took out all the photos and fluff text there might be enough actual information here to fill a ten page pamphlet. I really wanted a book that gave me encyclopedic information of the oils and the plants they come from, had a great table of contents that let me look up recipes by symptom, and gave me helpful suggestions on ways to combine the oils so that they smelled good. This book does not live up to it's title, and it only gets two stars a) it was cheap and b)there are a few grains of information buried in it that may be helpful until I can find what I really want."
5,can you say merengue?,"In 1994 ball room dance classes were introduced for fifth graders at two New York City schools. The pilot program was so successful that today 6,000 children in 60 NYC schools are required to take a ten-week class in ball room dancing, with teachers provided by the American Ballroom Theater. The documentary Mad Hot Ballroom gives you a front row seat and behind the scenes preview of what has now become an annual citywide competition. This is a wonderful film that would make for great family viewing and later discussion."
5,SOLID,"Virtually unknown in the U.S., Mike Scott latest opus is absolutely wonderful. With each listen, the rich textures of each song unfolds. This is his best work in years!"
1,Awful!,"Awful quality! I have all my original vinyl from the 70's and 80's. When I played this album I thought something was wrong with my needle, which is brand new. I took one of my old records out, played it, and it was fine. They just pressed this album very poorly. Save the $20 bucks...don't even bother."
5,5 Stars,"I think that the Clique was an awesome book, and I really enjoyed reading it. I think that everyone can relate to some aspect of the story, and that makes it intriguing. I suppose that the book goes a tad heavy with the label/designer-dropping, but that's the kind of book I like, so I wasn't bothered by it. I'd recommend it to anyone who's into gossip-y, fashion books."
5,The Cellist,I love the cello so this was an easy pick for me..the music is so beautiful...I so enjoyed every moment of the DVD and would recommend it to everyone.
2,Where's the beef?,"I don't understand all these glowing reviews. This book starts with a great premise, to make a case for the UFO cover up. Then, it doesn't deliver. What is exempt from disclosure? Approximately half the book is an rambling expose on supposed members of MJ-12, a project that many believe does not exist, as such, if at all. Then the second half is a collection of speculations about what may or may not be in the basement at Wright-Patterson and elsewhere. The only chapter that I found interesting was section III, ch 3, discussing how ""alien"" physics is not the same as ""our"" physics and why we have not been able to duplicate their propulsion system, material, etc. That alone would have made a great book. Yet the tidbits offered here only corroborate information already in the public domain by Bernhard Haisch, Pierre Geurin, and Wilbur Smith (see Good's Above Top Secret). But what's exempt about that?"
1,too much interference,"I bought this item for a customer. There was so much electrical noise on the system that you couldn't hear a dial tone at all. I then took the system to my house which has a good grounding system thinking that the electrical interference would be minimized but found that although it would work, there was the electrical hum there also and very loud. I tried to use it for a fax line, but half the time the faxes wouldn't go through so I had to disconnect it and I'm probably going to throw it away since I've had it so long I don't feel right about returning it."
5,Put Her On Top,"What do I like about Aimee? Her songs are real, unique and authentic. You can see her through the songs and through her voice - direct, clear, honest and punchy - and that brings me real pleasure. Not to mention that Mann has a wonderful feeling for the melodic line and a unique way of writing lyrics. When I listen to her music I see an interesting, independent, sparky, intelligent, irrepressible woman - in other words, attractive and sexy. Perhaps i am getting old."
5,This is a must-have baking book,"For all the times you are strapped for time but (pick your situation): have to bring dessert to a pitch-in, bake cookies for your children's school event (at 10 o'clock the night before!), have to make something to share for the after-church reception, want a pretty dessert to serve to guests, or have a major cookie craving, you will be happy you have this book. Love it!"
3,Buckets of blood or at least red paint,"The 10 DVDs in this collection are very uneven in quality. The Streetfighter movies have the best quality of the group. The samurai movies are not so hot (sorry Sonny, Toshiro Mifune you aren't). But at this price, its good fun and worth it just for the Streetfighter movies. My favorite scene in 'Return of the Streetfighter' is when Sonny whacks a bad guy in the head and the baddie's eyes pop out of his head (my teenage sons found this particularly hilarious)."
2,To small,The chain and medallion are way to small you can barely see the medallion when you have it on
4,bells,"If you like to hear bells this is for you. They sometimes get in the way of the music, but bells are for Christmas, aren't they? All the traditional American Christmas music is on this cd. They are played very well, but sometimes you have to break with tradition. I really wish that there would have been some other carols, like ""in the bleak midwinter"" or ""three Kings"". Other than that and maybe too many bells, I would reccomend this cd."
1,"Blues it isnt,noise and not much moore!","Very dissapointed.programmed, no feeling,not blues at all, in my opinion. Save your money,there are plenty of great other new releases out. The worst release that I ever bought,and with over 700 in my collection that should give it some weight(dead). Jason Mcdale"
4,Great for beginning chem students as it is large enough to read.,"This placemat is the perfect balance between a regulation sheet periodic table and a poster size.It is 17.5 inches by 12 inches and coated in really heavy plastic. Has Atomic number, symbol, name, atomic weight, valence shell configuration (and big enough to actually read), boiling, melting point, density, crystal structure and is color coded. It does stop at 112 and we are up to (in theory 118) but that is not going to be addressed in most beginning chem classes.Also 110, 111 and 112 do have names now Darmstadtium, Roentgenium and Copernicium respectively. So a new update would be nice (hence one star off, as it was published in 2000) , but again, for beginning students this will not be an issue."
3,Two tone watch,This watch has a gemstone type glass face which makes it hard to read the watch (blurry). I didn't like it. The watch itself is beautiful. I exchanged mine for the one with the flat face crystal and I love it.
3,Not What I was Hoping For,This book had so much potential to be great but in the end it just didn't deliver. I found it hard to like the main character because she seemed very selfish. The main plot could have been interesting but the details were too boring and drawn out. I would not recommend it.
1,Broken neck,Arrived with broken neck. Split just below tuners. Hanging by the strings. I contaced the company. I still have not recieved my replacement and it has been over 30 days.
1,RUINED by a line!!!!,"This song could have easily been a great r&b; ballad but that possibility was ruined by this lyric: ""Tear you into little pieces, swallow you like Reces Pieces....""No matter how you slice it, this lyric does not bode well for a love song. It is not romantic and really does not convey love in my book. I won't say the song sounds cannibalistic, it just goes over like a lead balloon. The music was good, the singing was good and for the most part the lyrics were good but having to hear that dreadful line everytime I heard this song made it off limits."
1,potty training based on bribery ?,"If I had known that I would have to buy a doll and ""treats"" to potty train my child , I would never have bought this book. Outdated method to say the least!"
1,Dewalt DW7350,"I would be glad to review this product, however I never received it. It was on a special at Amazon for $113.00 free freight. Never got sent according to Fedex. Now to reorder it the price has gone to $147.25. I have tried to call Amazon, and got some foreign speaking person, who I could not understand very well and all she could tell me was they will issue me a credit. Told her I don't want the credit, wanted the DW7350 Planer stand as advertised. So this was ordered on 6-17-10, as of today 7-20-10 ,I still do not have the stand or my credit. I never had this kind of service from Amazon. Very dissappointed.Mike L.State College, PA"
5,"Filmed by a Christian, for Christians","In ""India Face To Face"", filmmaker Jon Wood takes you to various towns and villages in India. Not to fancy resorts or the high-cast people, but to the sidewalks and slums where thousands of Indian's live every day.Each of the nine shows has a different theme, but all emphasize the fact that more people live below the poverty line ($1.08 a day) then we would like to realize, and also how desperately they need to be introduced to their Creator, and freed from the bondage of useless rituals and penances.While this DVD may not appeal to non-christians, or to those looking strictly for Indian culture, it did appeal to me, because as a christian, I find it inspiring and refreshing to see people spreading the good news of salvation in foreign lands.It is, in my opinion, very educational and eye-opening, and it really challenges you to take a closer look at how most of the world lives, and what you are doing to help them.Check it out, it's worth it."
4,Moving beyond Alzheimer's,"In this film actress Sarah Polley, 28, moves competently into screenwriting and directing, giving an unsentimental and yet not depressing look at Alzheimer's disease. Although the still beautiful Julie Christie plays the victim of the disease, the film belongs to Gordon Pinsent, who plays her husband, the one who must cope with being gradually left behind by his wife, whose memory is fragmenting. He learns to deal with his guilt and loss, to adapt to the situation, and to move on into his life."
1,ANOTHER belt problem!,"As was mentioned several times, the cleaning power of this machine is awesome (even with 2 long haired cats) but it just doesn't hold up. The 1st machine I purchased had the roller seize up and the belt burning the 2nd time it was used. Thinking this was just a fluke, I returned it to Walmart and got another one. This time the plastic piece holding the roller brush disintegrated and the belt burning smell occurred after 2 months of use. Buyer beware!"
2,Algunos clásicos,"Me sigue encantando HOMBRE G, pero en cuanto a este DVD pensé que iba a tener videos más populares sólo tiene algunos, no está tan completo y tiene unos que ni conocía. Los videos son: 1. por qué no ser amigos, 2. qué soy yo para tí. 3. no lo sé. 4. lo noto. 5. no te escaparás. 6. voy a pasármelo bien. 7. chico tienes que cuidarte. 8.Rita. 9. Esta es tu vida. 10. Una mujer de Bandera. Saludos y añadiré tus críticas."
3,Log Bed,"I asked the seller and the manufacturer if the king size bed came with center support. They both said yes. When we got it it didn't have any so we had to go to the lumberyard and have slats made. It cost us an extra $20. Without them, the mattress will sag in the middle."
2,My humble opinion...,"Well I bought both the chocolate chip and the oatmeal raisin. I can tolerate the chocolate chip, it's the only flavor I can stand. It's a dry, unappetizing cookies, BUT it does do the trick, I'm not hungry. I eat one for breakfast, lunch, and mid afternoon snack and a small meal of mostly protein. I have lost weight (10 pounds) in about 2 months. I DO NOT recommend the oatmeal raisin. I think it tastes absolutely vile. I had to spit out the one I had, kinda bummed as I have a full box just sitting on my counter. Overall it does the trick, it's not an amazing tasting cookie, remember that, but it gets you through the day without starving. Remember to drink a lot of water with it. But stay away from the oatmeal (YUCK!)"
3,"Good, but a little dilute","The book lives up to its brag of providing information on Windows 98 that is comprehensible to people who are not techno-geeks. It also addresses the kinds of questions that can be urgent to newcomers (e.g., ""Where did all my stuff go?"" or ""Why won't my computer respond?"") However, the information is diluted with more chat and cuteness than is needed; I think twice as much information could have been provided in this number of pages (and at this price) without compromising understandability. Perhaps then there wouldn't have had to be so many recommendations to go get ""More Windows 98 for Dummies"" and other ""Dummies"" books. In short: I recommend it for anyone confronted with Windows 98 and feeling a little helpless about it (as I was after upgrading from Windows 3.1), but don't expect to become very proficient based upon this book alone."
3,"Good over view, but still lacking","This guide is wonderful if you really needs the ""nuts & bolts"" of the game and what you need to do to pass the third year mark without being kicked out of town ^_^. However, there are many scenarios which are just covered lightly, or not at all. Exactly what should you do When Kia makes his announcement about Popouri at the end of the summer? What's the point of the town thief? What about if you baby is sick? Also, many little details are left out, such as many of the favorite treats (and least favorite) of the towns folk. Some things are just plain wrong. Like saying you get the better fishing pole after you have a pond full of 50+ fish, not to mention many of the recipes are incorrect (You might want to note Chef Sprite's recipe, since it's isn't even listed!).Again, it's a good guide for the basics. You can complete the game with it & do well. However it's no where near complete, and It could have been a much better guide with more attention to detail."
4,Great design but the stylus needs to be longer,"The overall design of the stylus is great and it has good accuracy. I especially like the attachment feature for the iPad using the earphone connector. The one thing that disappoints me is the length of the device. It is a litte under 4 and i/2 inches long. Since I use the iPad primarily for handwritten notes, I would prefer the length of the stylus to be that of a common ink pen, about 5 and i/2 inches long. If had a little more heft to it, it would feel more natural to those of us that still like to write. The specifications on the pen were not stated in the description, I believe they should be noted by the seller."
5,Delicious!,Must try this ones. I just cant stop eating them.. Just BEAUTIFUL the feeling inside your mouth. Will start buying in bulk
1,Why would some Maiden fan want to buy a thing like that !,"I can't understand the reason for compilations like this, about a band that is still active, recording and touring around the world. Sometimes old classics receive a fresh version, sounds more alive, but the bands involved in this project belong to minor league, has nothing to add to Maiden's discography. A total waste of time and money."
1,Disposable junk,"Works OK for about a year then it breaks down like the cheap piece of poor engineering it is. That's probably why the warranty is only good for a year. It's a rip-off, save your money."
4,From a man's point of view...,"And I loved it. Although I have not read this book, am a big fan of Nick Hornby. Am constantly amazed at his honest descriptions and then portrayals of his characters. Makes you believe these are true stories somehow. Very interesting and honest insight into how some people feel and think about events in their lives. Find myself able to laughingly relate. I enjoyed Cusack's character speaking to us throughout the film. I also enjoyed in Fever Pitch and About A Boy, how the main characters narrate their stories though not in the same way as High Fidelity."
1,Don't waste your money,"These are by far the most uncomfortable shoes I have ever worn. They are stiff as a board and have no flexibility when you walk. They look cute on, but are unbearable to wear."
3,spice girl,"A beautiful narrative and use of language creates a magical world, but ultimately the book disappoints with its California New Agey ending and characters that you thought would end up in something more exotic than dreaming of living in the Oregon woods, like 60s hippies."
5,Great if you want to learn the basics,"This book is great if you want to learn the basics of relational database design in a non-platform dependant manner. Some of the information may seem useless, such as the interview process, if you are just looking for designing a database for your own personal use. In a business environment this essential. As an individual who had not messed with database design since dBase III+, I found the book quite useful as a refresher and an excellent warm-up for more advanced books."
4,TORRID by Morgan Hawke,"A straight dance instructor is asked to play the part of a stripper at a bachelorette party. While shopping for his ""costume"", he meets a sexy and mysterious man who flirts with him. Though the dance instructor has never been attracted to men before, he can't help being intrigued by the sexy stranger, and they begin a sweet and steamy affair.This one is very cute and very sexy. ""But I'm not gay!"" is one of my favorite M/M themes (besides the ""best friends"" theme), so I really enjoyed this one. It's fun and it doesn't take itself too seriously. Just hot men, spicy sex, a budding relationship, and a whole lot of fun."
5,septic - rid-x,"I use rid-x all the time, but having it shipped to me, every month is a great off, and you can't beat the price."
1,Junk Science,"This Book is worth nothing, not even the paper it is printed on.The book is totally self-contradictory and the book contains useless facts and is much too verbose. A waste of time and money."
5,Each Little Bird That Sings,"[...]Each Little Bird That Sings is a really meaningful book. It has a lot of emotion in it, and I cried a lot by the end. Comfort had a huge transformation, and has a very believable personality. It was very enjoyable to read and I could not put down the book. The writing was very rich and had a lot of descriptive paragraphs. Over all, the book was really good, but it is not the sort of book I would read again. Part of the excitement and enjoyment is the various surprises and the suspenseful plot."
4,Shango/Django?,"from what i heard this can only be the start of something big. trad jazz (eg Thad Jones & normal 3/4-tets must be paying Jimmy Smith & Captain Jack the same dues finally that Joey DiFrancesco is getting, playing also cornet, because this organ stand-in ""six string bass"" guitar is using what rock has dropped for decades - WAH-WAH pedal as a judicious organ stop. This is no acid jazz, this hip rhythm collective reaches back to the original rhythm section of the standard trio to pull out some funk & rescue the lowly hendrix pedal from oblivion. No label, this is straight ahead. i followed it up from Christian Jacob/Steve Swallow, another rock transfer (Chuck Mangione, or was it ""Larry Coryell""?), & can only describe what can't be summarized - listen w/ caution, it is uncommon rare."
5,A true masterpiece by a true master.,"Spider-man Torment set the tone for what Todd McFarlane was capable of doing on his own. This story is the result of McFarlane's brilliant artwork and equally icredible script.McFarlane brings new life into an old villain: The Lizzard. The Lizzard however is under the spell of a mysterious character. Will these two bring and end to our hero Spider-man? Well, it sertainly looked like it!!"
5,Criterion Collection = 5 STARS!,"What an absolute perfect release for this movie. After reading all the negative reviews it's obvious most of them are due to the previous inadequate releases. Well, they should all log back in and delete them because this IS the definitive release of one of my all time favorite movies! The '70s-era packaging and a totally awesome selection of bonus features makes this special edition two-disc release of Dazed and Confused one of the very best DVDs of all time!Some of the best lines ever!""Let me tell you what Melba Toast is packin' right here, all right. We got 4:11 Positrac outback, 750 double pumper, Edelbrock intake, bored over 30, 11 to 1 pop-up pistons, turbo-jet 390 horsepower. We're talkin' some f'n' muscle."" --Wooderson""That's what I love about these high school girls, man. I get older, they stay the same age."" --Wooderson""Say, man, you got a joint?"" --Wooderson""No, not on me, man. "" --Mitch""It'd be a lot cooler if you diid."" --Wooderson"
4,Spy Kid,"Li'l Harriet is an aspiring author,and she keeps a journal,a spy journal,in which she writes down her opinions on everything that is happening around her.Sadly,she has written some pretty mean things about her friends.She thinks she is just being funny,but when her pals see the journal,she is left friendless.They are so mean to her that she plots revenge on every single one of them.That's when her parents send her to a psychiatrist!!Will HArriet get her friends back and her life back to normal?Find out.By Linda.Bye."
4,turning stones,"Marc Parent shows the truth about Emergency Children's Services. Parent tells of the struggles and pain that many children go through day in and day out. He tells of the long hours that the EMC put in everyday. Parent moves people with this book by telling exactly what the children are thinking and what actually happens to them. ""Turning Stones"" is a must read!MA"
2,Disappointment in a box,"Was excited I got a great price, but let down when I opened the package. It looked scuffed before I even wore it. Hate to say this (because I'm Chinese): but it looks like it's made in China. I didn't even try it on. Back it went to Amazon. You have to tell them you're not happy with the defect (poor quality), or else they'll ding you."
4,Flea free cats,I was almost scared off from ordering because the estimated receive date was a month from the order date. That was not the case and I had the product within 2 weeks. Good customer service when I contacted the company and a good price for this product. I was satisfied.
3,Illustrated edition good; story so-so,"The Illustrated edition was a good deal; the illustrations were quite good impressions of the content. The narrative itself in the early part had too much religious philosophy -- although the basic idea of mixing Hinduism, Judaism, and Christianity was worthwhile. After pressing on, several sections were needlessly gross. In the final part with the island, I was just not able to suspend disbelief (even taking it as allegory or hallucination). Maybe the movie will be better."
3,When giants roamed - and Bill Withuhn offers vacuous comments,"This would have been a fantastic video if the frequent comments from Bill Withuhn had been left out. The comments are opinion, not fact, and anytime I hear him speak I am reminded that he is a politician rather than a railroader or railroad fan. Michael Palin would have been the perfect host for this video as seen in his recent journeys series with Nat Geographic.The video of steam trains in action in the DVD does compensate for the issue above, however. Good variety and very high quality. Loved the N&W; Y and UP Big Boy footage."
1,Bag O Sha 2005,"Let's drop the average for Lenny's book a notch for his panning of the great movie Kingpin, which does have heart, contrary to what this buffoon says. It seems that all of Lenny's taste is in his mouth.Bah.Save you pennies and visit some online dvd-review sites as well as reading other customer views, it will certainly be more comprehensive."
1,The Colt-DVD,"The Colt is a Hallmark production with a ""Not Rated"" statement;however our family was very disappointed with the number of times God's name was used in vain. This is not necessary for what could have been a wonderful movie. Not only was God's name abused, but several other vulgar words were used. It is difficult to sit and watch a movie with so much swearing in it. I was highly disappointed. The reviews were misleading and did not mention anything about language. Before we purchase a movie we depend on the reviews and went by those, trusting what they said. We were deceived. We can not return it because it was opened. So I guess we are out $8.53.We would not recommend this movie to anyone."
1,Urban Geography - unprofessional seller,"I did not recieve the book I ordered. The seller sent me an old edition, and the ISBN number did not match the number I entered when I ordered the text. The cover does not match the cover on the website as advertised. When I talked to Amazon regarding the problem, they contacted the seller. The seller asked me to return the textbook for a refund minus shipping. That did not resolve my problem. Amazon did, however, help me out. They are sending me the correct textbook."
5,fabulous product!,"Anyone thinking about making the switch from tampons or pads to this product...don't think twice. I feel like a totally different woman! My cramps are significantly decreased and I barely think about my period when I have it. It takes some getting used to inserting and taking out the DivaCup, but it wasn't a hard learning curve for me. I will say, after reading some comments, I tried inserting the cup after soaking in some boiling water...and it did wonders to help with the very mild lower back pain and cramps. I slept like a baby that night. I have been raving to all my friends, and now I had to come online to let everyone know, TRY THIS PRODUCT, you will wonder why you ever used tampons and the like, and you are doing something nice for the environment (and your bathroom trash)."
5,Hot without being embarrasing,"Unbuttoning Emmalina it's definately a hot read. Reminds you why there are all those buttons on wedding dresses. And might I just say - what a great way to use doilies.Tangled Images was presented before. It's an okay read - I always wonder why Mack (and Mack's family) would endanger his school teacher career by having him be an underwear model. You just know that some people would have a fit about it -- which destracts me from the story.Sinderella is great. Who hasn't wondered about seducing the man of their dreams? All it takes for Frankie is a mask, great lingerie, and a costume party. I love the opening to this book and the fact that her brother figures out what's going on. LOLLeather and Lace was weirdly good. While I would never fall off the catwalk while modeling leather, lace and handcuffs it was still a good story. Loved the ""uncle"" scene - it was good for a chuckle."
5,Wish they still made these.,Best FM transmitter I have had. To bad the FCC has required the newer versions to be weaker in signal strength.
5,Very pleased!,I bought these to go along with the children's set. I thought it would be nice to have adult size cups to go along with her set for me to use as well as for her as she got older. Then she would always be able to use it no matter what age she was. I am very pleased with it. I love how each cup is different in shape and color.
3,Nice portable USB flash drive,"Its a great USB flash drive to carry around, its rubberized outside makes it better likely to handle drops. Also easy to grip. Its not as fast or as slim as the Sony 16gb flash drive but I feel this would be better to carry around then the Sony or the Cruzier flash drive. Also its a bit bulky so on a crowded USB hub you may have to remove some thing for it to fit."
5,A must have for the price/ sound,"In the past two weeks I have ordered many different types an sizes of earbuds(I figured my ears must be a different SIZE than everyone else's)since most of the ones I ordered didn't feel good on/in my ear. I didn't want to spend a fortune on Earbuds that I would probably lose or sit on and crush. Since I use them with my mp3 player(iriver) and mainly for walking, price was a major concideration. The Sony MDR-EC21LP earbuds I have found to be great in the two areas that I have mentioned ""price/confort"" I would recommend them very highly to people with different size ears like mine."
3,Honest look at the phenomenon,"A straight forward no, nonsense peek into the phenomenon of Star Trek fanaticism. Denise Crosby, presents a fairly unbiased look at the world of the Star Trek fan. Viewers can make up his or her own mind as to whether it's all in good fun, or that some of these people aren't ""working with all thrusters"".Essentially it is a collection interviews with fans at conventions as well as interviews with all the major cast members.As a documentary it is somewhat loosely put together. Let's just say it won't win any academy awards for best documentary.This DVD--licensed by Paramount-- and therefore, as usual overpriced is a low budget documentary which the studio clearly aimed at the die-hard fan willing to pay anything."
1,Little to hold my interest,"I had a tremendously difficult time sitting through this movie. There is nothing good I can say about it. It is poorly written, directed and forced upon the unsuspecting audience before you know what hits you.The plot involves nine friends who get together at a cabin in the woods, ""Big Chill"" style but minus the style. Then we must endure cheesy dialoge while the movie plods along, unfolding new and uninteresting facts about each relationship as if we cared enough to want to know. The more I learned the less I cared.It was such a let down that I feel writing this review will somehow make my time spent worthwhile by saving someone else the misery.Carol"
1,Don't waste your money or time watching this movie!!!!!,"Bad plot, tiring to watch main charactor betray everyone and everything. Halfway though the movie we switched it off, we truly wasted out money."
3,A well-acted family movie.,"In this movie (very similar, in atmosphere and personality, to GRIZZLY ADAMS), two modern-day Oregon children are transported back to 1870 via a cave while on a camping trip. There, they help a mountain man named Jeremiah save the mountain from a greedy businessman and his cohorts. The children are compelled to help Jeremiah, because if the mountain is destroyed, so is their hope of returning to the 1990s. The character of Jeremiah is very much like Grizzly Adams: likable and well able to take care of himself in the mountains. The children are well able to handle themselves, and in their efforts to do so, they sometimes try Jeremiah's patience. All in all, it's a good movie. In a way, it's a politically correct movie: the theme is that it's wrong to develop mountains or any other wild areas for business purposes. Political correctness aside, I give this movie a thumbs-up for family quality. And but for one swear word, used once, I would rate it G."
3,Okay but could be better,"I was a bit disappointed in this book. The illustrations are too chaotic for very small children to relate with, I find. I also have some problems with the more sensitive parts of the text, which seem to address adoption issues but do so almost dismissively and overly lightly. There is definitely too much focus on the adoptive parent's story rather than the child's story. Although that can be useful, it can be done much more creatively in ways that children can relate to more, such as in The Red Thread. Despite that, it gets three stars because adoption is a tough topic and anyone who tries reasonably deserves one credit. I still use the book, I just change the wording a bit and that is always possible."
4,12 Sharp needs sharpening.,"THe story was good, but not as good as her other Plum books. It wasn't as funny this times as in others books.Keep writing the Plum books, they still are a good read!"
4,A nice neat package,"For anyone who has suffered from the UF Productivity Virus, this is the Vaccine. Definately a must have for any Geek. And a saver on Printer Paper. The organization and flow is wonderful...my only wish? More new content. But I'm not complaining, this will definately be a gift to anyone I know who has not discovered Illiad's masterpiece."
5,Garmin dashboard mount flawless,"recently used the Garmin dashboard mount on our trip to Myrtle Beach. Since I am a law enforcement officer I know what thieves are looking for. With the Garmin dashboard mount you can easily take the bag off your dashboard and place it under your seat. It is such an advantage over the window mount. Many times people have their GPS's stolen because they have the mount stuck to their window, even though the GPS is not connected, thieves are smart enough to see this and realize that the GPS is probrably in the car somewhere. The dashboard bag, as I call it is easily accecable and does not slide or move when driving, you can easily move it around and adjust it. the GPS mounts to it and disconnects very easily. I love this product."
2,Months Later,"I don't judge albums by my expectations, but I do admit that they leak through from time to time. Regardless, I do believe that as a band you have the obligation to give fans what they want. The reason Radiohead has been so successful is their guitar-driven, opera-like, brilliantly unbelievable music. Guitar is almost completely eradicated on this record, and Thom's vocals, which in the past have been incredibly powerful and moving, are either used as backround or just not very passionate. I still have faith in Radiohead, they still have it in them. They are the best at what they do, I just hope they don't lose sense of what that is."
4,Worth a read,"While not the best Holmes pastiche that I've read, The Star of India still deserves an honorable mention. It has its share of suspense and Holme's deductive powers. The language and flow of the story is quite different that that of the original canon, and it could be quite distracting.I would reccommend giving this a read, although it could use some work. I hope that Ms.Bugge writes more Holmes pastiches, because this one was quite enjoyable."
4,Suspense from the beginning,Restraining Order was a surprising movie. It was filled of the unknown. The characters were all great. What you may thought was going to happen is not what happened. You would never expect the ending but it was great getting there.
4,A classic reminder of the Soviet system,"As in his more famous ""Life and Fate,"" Grossman does a brilliant job getting into the minds of a variety of Soviet characters who are forced to deal with Stalin's brutal system and its aftermath. It is enlightening for those of us in the West to realize that, unlike the Germans after the fall of Hitler, the Russian people never had ""closure"" with their even bloodier past. Grossman shows us the thinking, not only of the released prisoners of the gulag, but the soul-searching of the men and women who denounced them or who merely stood by."
5,It's totally awesome and it's just the beginning,"This book is wonderful. After reading this book, Bernard Werber became my favorite author. Who would have thought ants could be so interesting ? A lot of readers think human characters are not as good written as ants, that's probably true for that book but not for the following one, which is, I think, the best one. However I'm sure most of the readers tried to build 4 equilateral triangles out of 6 matches... Being french, I read the Trilogy (as well as his other books) and as several people said : the end is really the beginning. To conclude, I met Bernard Werber several times and he's as much interesting as his books."
1,Baffled,"When I received this product, I expected everything to go perfectly from the awesome reviews I read. My product's rubber gasket is TOO BIG, there is no possible way it can fit. I am extremely disappointed."
5,Good Recipes,I like a lot of the normal foods (not the super fancy stuff) and this book delivers nicely. I entertain a lot and people really seem to like it.
4,"Pricey, but worth it","The 20GB HDD that came with my 360 has served me well for the last 3 years, but with the NXE and game installations I've suddenly found its 13GB of usable space extremely limiting. Luckily the 120GB is now going for much less than the $180 that Microsoft was originally asking for it (I paid $125). It's still a lot of money for a 120GB 2.5"" drive (OEM drives go for around $60). Moving from the 20GB drive to the new one was pretty simple (just attach the cable and insert the disk), if not a bit slow (it took me about an hour and a half for the whole process). I doubt I'd consider this a worthwhile upgrade from a newer 60GB drive, but for those with the older 20GB drives or Arcade units it improves the experience greatly."
4,Worthy of it's legendary name,"The writing isn't that great and the acting is hit and miss, but this is one of the better Rocky films. Stallone ended the series on a high note with this one."
5,Simply Awesome,"Styles of Beyond's debut album is a modern hip hop classic. So many hip hop groups are signing with major labels these days (J-5 and Dilated Peoples are both currently working on albums for major labels), it's great to see a truly underground hip hop group. All the tracks on the album are great, but standouts are ""Styl Warz"" featuring Rhettmatic, and the absolutely amazing ""Winnetka Exit"". That song has the greatest lyrics I've heard in a long, long time. Styles of Beyond reminds me of A Tribe Called Quest in their prime, with a bit of Herbaliser thrown in, while still maintaining a very unique sound. But if you consider yourself a fan of hip hop - or music in general - do yourself a favour, and pick up ""2000 Fold""."
2,Disappointing and sloppy,"This is a review of the KINDLE edition.I read books to escape the everyday. I dive into other lives and other worlds, and come up for air after an hour or more. That's how I like to read books. Total submersion, no interruptions, a private time, almost like a little vacation. When I picked up this book for free for my Kindle, I expected it to be a full version, edited and ready for readers. After the first few pages, I found out that it was not. I was constantly jarred back to reality with incredibly numerous typos - an unbearable intrusion into my zen of reading. Time after time, almost on every page, the same typos appear throughout the book. ""hi"" instead of ""in"", ""mad"" instead of ""that"", and so on and so on. It is so obnoxious, it makes it impossible to really get into the book. Very, very sloppy publishing. Shame on you, Harper Collins."
4,Excellent Jazz/Salsa CD,"I got this CD and couldn't stop dancing. While it was made back in the 60's before I was born, I find it light, jazzy and I can't be still when I listen to it. A must for any serious jazz collector."
4,Read en re-read this book.,"I read this book some years ago and was very pleased to notice that it recently has been translated in dutch, so I could recommand it to friends. I read the mahjipoor chronicles too en hope to find the other books about mahjipoor."
1,wont fit 60CXS,I order a 60CXS Garmin GPS and the Amazon website suggested this case for it which I ordered but it doesn't fit the GPS.
3,Worthwhile for the version of Summa alone.,"If this is your first stopping-off point listening to Part, you might find it more rewarding to begin with some of his more recent recordings or the better known works such as Tabula Rasa or Kanon Pokajanen.However, this CD is certainly worth trying if only for the recording of Summa, (track 5) which is undoubtedly the best version that I have found to date amongst his work."
2,"great color, but chips almost immediately","Love, Love and yes I love the color, but chips two days out. And yes I added top coat again and again. It chips!"
2,SMALLL,"I guess it was my fault for not comparing measurments. There are verny beutiful ,but really really small and fragile."
1,It freakin burned a Bugera V22,"Don't buy these, I got them and have them installed in a Bugera V22 by a professional, after 30 secs of normal use some resistances started to burn... if it hadn't been for my hommie standing next to the power chord who knows what would've happen...I brought them into Mexico so I can't really do anything from but warn you about this terrible product."
2,dumber by the minute,I felt really dumb watching this. I turned it off after a little while and I didn't feel so dumb.
5,Great value through Amazon,"Was able to make sure with .pdf that I was buying the correct cables for my tire size, Prompt delivery allowed for double check installation & they went on pretty easy & now I am ready for the snow & I guess the ice too."
1,Worthless For Palm Z 22,"Okay I guess for Tungsten and Zire model of Palm devices it's a decent enough looking case, I'm not happy about the fact thst Amazon steered me there when I bought my Palm Z-22, even going so far as to suggest it as a bundle. I never owned one of these things, for all I knew ""Z"" as in Z-22 could have stood for Zire, and that's with my clicking for more info. Now I have to go around asking my friends whether they own a Zire or Tungsten, so I can gift it back, unless one of you readers has one of these machines and would like a bargain. I have to warn you though, the plastic is sliced open and retaped, just the way it arrived even though I thought I was buying new, when I made the purchase. In fact the retape job was so poor, I was able to easilly slip the little white elephant right out and right back in again without so much as stretching the tape. Just kidding, I'll find someone who needs one I guess. Tiz the Season after, all."
5,Great Product FAST FAST SHIPPING HIGH QUALITY,"mounted my 24"" lcd tv with this mount in my bar and was easy to install with easy instructions and tools. Took less than 20 minutes. Make sure to measure the back of the tv for where the wall mount screws in. I had to customize my mount a bit with some brackets i had laying around to make it work but real quick fix. Overall the tv is still hanging on the wall great motion and tilt perfect for high places. Highly recommend this mount and seller for this mount!"
5,A must have,I am so glad I bought this item. It makes driving screws so much faster and easier. I am going to buy an extra one soon just in case I wear this one out.
1,Dulled every knife,Don't buy this! I can't believe people think this is a good sharpener. Dulled every knife I used it on
1,nothing new here,"Apparantly, the way to get filthy, stinking rich is to write a book like this and have all the ""rich boy wannabes"" buy it. This book has no ""earth-shattering""revelations in it; in fact, it is not even a good instructional manual. It tells the reader to get rich by starting his own business. OK, that's fine. I agree you'll never get rich by working for someone else. But starting a business is risky(remember, the Small Business Administration states that 90% of newly opened businesses in this country fail in the first year!). And this book really doesn't offer any practical info to get you started."
2,Don't work,While this product may be good for some it did not work for me. I have noticed no difference since taking this product.
2,Sateen sheets?,"We received our sheet set and they felt like Sateen, but when we washed them they lost the Sateen feel. They feel like flannel. We are very disappointed with our purchase."
2,For the wealthy,"While so many of Europe's hotels have increased in price, Spain has remained 'a deal', until just recently. I thought from all of its glowing reviews that this book would offer some choices for those of us who do not want to spend $100+ a night. While there are a few deals, most of the listings were of no value to me. Friends who had gone to Spain had better recommendations. This book is for those with a high-median pocketbook, and who prefer a 'pedestrian' route in life. If that's you, perhaps you would like this book, but I did not."
4,Great frame great price,Simple design simple price. I would buy again for multiple rooms in the house. Material seems to be above average quality.
2,Not a Bad racquet not a good one either...,Not the best of the racquets around.. I had the string cut more than twice within 3 months.. but kind of ok to play. You need to put a lot of power to send the ball back otherwise its a decent racquet but would advise prince O3 compared to this one.
3,A legend in the making,"There are always problems with a sophamore CD. The biggest problem with ONCE AGAIN is GET LIFTED...after that stunning CD, this was a hard act to follow and it did not quite make it. Mr Legend is, after collaborations with Kanye West, Sergio Mendes and his contribution to the Luther tribute album, this low profiled man had us all aquiver with anticipation, there are no collaborations here however. In the main this seems to be contemplative and personal. A man and his piano, apparently obsessed with Maxine. An honest and sweet CD. Stand out tracks are ""Save Room"", ""Heaven"" and ""P.D.A (we just don't care)"" are fine pieces, but no ""Ordinary People"". There is much to enjoy, but you are advised to take it on its own merits and try not to compare."
5,great album,"there's nothing to say, this is kick ass album, especialy the dynamic duo ammot btother, they has legacy to carry on of hetfield and hammet, mustaine and friedman, scolnick and peterson, and the legend is continue to ammot brother...its very very good album...."
3,Triple.fi and SE530 are MUCH BETTER,"If your considering buying these earphones, I highly suggest you take a look at the Ultimate Ears Triple.fi 10 Pro or the Shure SE530. The Triple.fi's retail for the same price($399.99) and according to EVERYONE, the Triple.fi walks all over these. If you want Shure's, the SE530s are AMAZING! earphones which are $299.99 now on this website but retail for $499.99. Choosing between the Triple.fi 10 Pro(more refined-sounding) and the SE530(more full-sounding) depends on personal taste, but both easily surpass any other earphone on the market besides the custom molded Ultimate Ears UE-10 Pro(THE BEST) which retail for $900.00."
5,Her best recording bar none,"I've been a fan for 30 years and this was it as far as I'm concerned. Start to finish this plays like a great roadhouse jukebox pumped full of quarters in the mid-70's. She was never so twangy or more tender. The Hot Band was never hotter. Combine this with Bob Dylan's ""Desire"" where she sings harmony on five tracks and Linda Ronstadt's ""Heart Like A Wheel"" with a great duet on ""I Can't Help It If I'm Still In Love With You"" and you have what I consider classic Emmylou."
2,Reminicent of a Show Choir or Karaoke Back-up Singers,"Way too bland for even my tastes, a lover of Britney, Mandy Moore, etc."
2,"Doesn't repair, just improves a little.....","I ordered this product because I'm stationed in Iraq and the sand is damaging the DVD's. Just minor scratches nothing big, this product kind of cleans them but it doesn't fix them by any means. It says it will fix minor scratches, they must mean, micro scratches, because the DVD's I was trying to improve weren't scratched that bad. It did work a little, run the DVD through it a few times and you can get close to what the product claims."
2,Not the complete issues,"Really Disappointing! If you're looking to have the first issues of COLORS don't buy this. This ""book"" synthesize at a very low level each issue and the text of some ""photos"" is impossible to read because of it's size."
4,"Good kite, unsure of the price","Bought this as a gift and it was a wonderful looking kite. It performs well and seems to be durable even with a notice crashing it a few times. I'm not ""into"" kites so I'm unsure if this is a good price or not. With a few minutes of reasearch it seemed like it is but am unsure of how to accurately compare different kites. It does fold up into a small bag for easy travel which is a plus."
2,Ultimately Disappointing,"Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Nelson DeMille. He is my favorite author. But this was a weak effort. The first 100 pages (of 485) slog along at a snail's pace. The action picks up soon thereafter and builds strongly to about 450, but then it treads water for about 30 pages before fizzling out. DeMille states in the acknowledgements that his 24 year-old son helped him with the ending - - and it shows! I found it a giant cop-out and utterly dissatisfying. Now I anxiously wait for DeMille's next novel, due out late this year. I only hope it's the ""old"" Nelson DeMille who authors it."
1,A poor book on Patton,I donated this book to charity after reading only the first 15 pages. I've read several books on General George Patton but this is the only disappointing one.
5,The Tain,I've been searching for a good translation of The Tain. This by far exceeded my expectations. I would recommend this to those studying Irish myth and legend.
4,Lovely Story,"I enjoyed reading this book, but found that it left me with questions. One of which, was stated on the blurb, that ""Arnrings' past begins to unravel, revealing a shattering secret that reaches back nearly a century"". IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. I kept waiting for something spectacular to come out, but there was nothing there. If they meant the fact that he was illegitimate that appears in the beginning of the book. It also states that he went west....but he ended up in Texas??? I adore Ms Plain's books and will forever keep on reading them, but these mistakes should be caught before publication.Actually the book is stated as a generational book, but it takes us 310 pages with Adam's story, and leaves us with only 46 pages of the next two generations. I was confused with the story of Mr. Snow (Leo). It states that he picked up the litter of puppies abandoned beside the road, and it was in fact Adam's mother Eileen."
5,Scarlet Johansson..Need I say more?,"The movie is absolutely awesome definitely one of the better Marvel films I've seen. Oh and did I mention Scarlet? Great flic, must see!!"
1,Damaged Merchandise,I received this pendant today and a stone was missing. This was my first purchase with Gem Avenue. I cannot believe that I waited about 10 days to get the package and it came damaged. I guess they have a poor quality control department. It was quite obvious that the stone was missing. Maybe someone there is blind as a bat!
4,"Works great, cord is a little short","The suction on this vacuum is awesome, and it's light and the retracting handle makes it convenient for storage. There's another review for this vacuum on here from an industry expert, read that one instead of mine."
3,Ver y good,"I purchased this when it was released and just now am submitting a review. ""Beautiful World"" didn't light a fire under my tail when it was released but as time has past it has made its mark as a very good effort. ""Resignation Superman"" grows stronger with each listen as does the title track and ""Crazy Mary"" but then again I could list every song here. This effort may not be a good as previous BHTM efforts but don't letthat discourage you. BHTM are mellow and profound. Todd's guitar is smooth and easy as is his lyrics which are wise beyond his years. A true ""craft"" band, honing their style and crafting their art, they never fail to deliver quality in the studio and on stage."
3,Good little light - except for horrible flickering.,"This is a nice light if you keep in mind that its one of the most inexpensive products of this type on Amazon.The night/emergency light is amber. If you don't want an amber light, you don't want this product. The light is pretty bright and with the amber color I'm not sure I'd put it in a bedroom, but its good for hallways or bathrooms.The flashlight is white and fairly small. It can be manually engaged. I wouldn't use it as a flashlight for working on a car or anything but its handy if the power is out and you need something.Update-Under certain lighting conditions the nightlight with constantly flicker on and off which is very annoying. Most devices of this time have the turn off threshold set above the turn on threshold to prevent this from happening, but it appears this does not. This drops my rating from 5 to 3 stars which is probably generous at that. :("
4,Great impulse buy!,"I did not set out to buy this kit, I just needed one more item to get Free Shipping. I AM SO GLAD I BOUGHT IT!!! I go camping at least once a year, and it's usually rainy, windy, and muddy for at least one to two of the 4 days. The extra stakes turned out to be a necessity, and the mallet pleases my aging bones. While I still haven't used the broom, IT WAS REALLY HELPFUL TO HAVE THE STAKE PULLER. For a price of under $20 it was a perfect impulse buy!"
1,doesn't work not worth it,people please that's why they are selling it cheap because they wan to get rid of this product it doesnt work its crap really don't waste your time.tested it on blackberry no difference.
3,not that bezerk over wazbones.,"A band that was on it's way up when it came to climing the hairspray-metal charts way back in the late 80's. Their best album was and still is.........BEZERK!.... As for this Wazbones cd it is not bad.Harder then the first two cd's ok,but not something I was crazy about after hearing what they came out with on BEZERK!Hair-metal isn't only about the amount of hairspray a band puts on,it has a special kind of sound and that sounds isn't on the Wazbones cd. My opinion is,if you are not a 100% Tigertailz fan and just like to find out what this band has to offer....find BEZERK...........as the noise level on that cd is critical!Did I mention they aslo have a live cd out called ""You Looking At me?""."
3,"Same, but different","I graduated from Berkeley High 11 years ago. Social aspects of the school are the same, ""tracking"" students seems to be the same, I had 3 principals in the 4 years I was there, but are these kids learning anything? The book seems to focus on classtime being spent talking about current issues at the school (racism, crime, death) rather than the main reason kids go to school. When I went there, a paper was not accepted if it was turned in late - period. If this is the case, college (and ""real life"") is going to be a great big slap in the face. An accurate portrayal of the high school, but not complete enough."
4,Love story,"""Not my Dog"" is not great literature, but it is a darling story. All adults and most children have at some time wanted something so badly that any substitute falls short. Ellie wanted a puppy and when the family took Great-aunt Margaret's dog because she could not have him in her new apartment, Ellie was broken hearted and knew in her heart that Preston would never be her dog. But as happens, Preston turned out to be special."
1,"Don't buy from this vendor. Batteries that I got were old, not working with an expired date on label.","Don't buy from this vendor. Batteries that I got were old, not working with an expired date on label."
4,VERY GOOD QUALITY,"I really like this voice changer. I got it for my son, who has also enjoyed it. It is of very good quality. It provides an opportunity to speak in numerous voices. It is easy to hold without it being too small / large or slipping. It works without batteries, something all parents will appreciate. There are a few voice changers that look to be of slightly higher quality that are sold for lots more. The less expensive options did not appear to be good enough. So, while I wish the price were a lot less, this offers better quality, I think. Its an enjoyable toy, but, I don't think that children will play with it as long as I did with empty boxes. I rate it a solid ""B"" and it comes recommended."
5,john waters collection,"Woweee!!! I wasn't really familiar w/ John Waters except the original Hairspray, (which is wonderful!:-), but holey guacamolee~ this guy is truly a loony tune!! I love his work, his cast, the writing... It is so off-the-wall & entertaining... definitely Not for the faint of heart. If you have a quirky sense of humor, & prefer to travel outside the boring, predictable hollywood sh*t, then Mr. Waters is for you!! (alot of fun to exercise to :-) An A++ in my book!! :-)"
5,i thought it was the best soundtrack i've heard,"this cd really brought out the best songs from the best scenes in the movie. if you enjoyed the film bottle rocket, i suggest you buy this cd because it will make you appreciate the good music. i, being a true bottle rocket and wes anderson fan, see this cd as a gem."
4,Biltmore Since George Died,"This book is intriguing for those who enjoy nonfiction. It describes how Biltmore formed a business to keep from being sold and subdivided, what happened to the family members since George's death, and the relationship between Biltmore and the city of Asheville, among other things. It is extremely interesting if you would like to know more about the history of the estate and its families."
4,Great Manual,"Very thorough, and descriptive. This is the manual to get if you want to start tinkering w/ your Intruder."
5,Great new version of Office,Office 2007 makes many office tasks easier and more intuitive. It is also full of many visualy pleasing tools for photos etc... Best version of office yet!
2,Only ActiveX? Are you kidding?,"Linksys seems to be living in the last decade. This camera can only be observed remotely with an ActiveX capable browser, in other words, Internet Explorer.What this means: NO Macintosh, NO Firefox, NO Flock...To make it worse, the ActiveX control has an expired certificate, which means you can't install it without tweaking the default security settings in the browser.Come on Linksys, you can do better!!!! How about Flash based video, or quicktime, or Windows Media Video? ActiveX is a thing of the past."
1,Don't waist your money,"The ONLY and I mean ONLY reason to watch this movie would be for Katee Sackhoff; who is not even the star of the movie as the movie cover would have you to believe. I believe the producers are attempting to play on her popularity in Battlestar Galactica. The story line is absolutely terrible unbelievable and laughable (especially when they try to pass off a 1980's IBM computer as the latest in high tech electronic equipment, yes they still have the old green and black screens). DO NOT waist your money on this. I'm sure at some point the Sci-fi channel will re-run this movie and if you must watch it (again for Katee Sackhoff) then do so. I have no idea why this was put to blue ray before even BSG was."
2,It's in english...,... the real Sailor Moon music is in Japanese. The original language. Compare The Power of Love to La Soldier and see what wins. Spend your money on an import. 'nuff said.Professor Tomoe Souichi from Sailor Moon Super
1,Lutheran Book of Prayer,This book was printed with a fine light font. I couldn't read it. Concoria should consider it's readers and use a heavier darker font. I gave the book away rather than sending it back
2,Not for Single Mothers by Choice,"This book is good for some situations, but it is not appropriate for planned single parent families, i.e. through donor insemination or adoption. More specifically, it is designed for talking about why the man who fathered you is not here, not for talking about why I chose to start a family with you without a father."
5,absolutely lifechanging,"I am a somewhat cynical person; however, after seeing this film I was absolutely blown away. It affirms what I have known for years, but some had forgotten, that the best way to serve God is to serve your fellow man. Watching the devotion to others and to God that the people in this film exhibit under very trying circumstances has caused me to recommit myself to the cause. I highly recommend this film to those who, like myself, heartily dislike the standard vanilla ""Christian"" fare usually presented in the mainstream, but still would like to be able to view inspirational type films that relate this strongly to the real world. The joy that these people exhibit in worship and in daily life, set against the backdrop of addicts, gangs, and urban decay, makes me ashamed that I've not been more thankfull for where I am, and how little I've given back. If I could, i would give it 10 stars...."
1,really disappointed.,This is made of all plastic and its the cheap plastic that breaks really easy. I was using my sig p226 for 40 feet away and it just tore right through it. I took the sticky part off of it and just stuck it to the wall and it worked fine that way.
3,got it too late,"This book is a good book. However, my daughter is 3 and was bored with it. She loves the Hungry Caterpillar and it is much too similar. So I would recommend one or the other but not owning both."
3,"Good, but I wish mp3 bitrate was higher","GOOD: It's the soundtrack to Jurassic Park, one of my favorites from composer John Williams.BAD: I use very high-quality headphones when listening to my music and I can hear the compression in some of the tracks. Those that were recorded at 192kb and higher sound excellent, but if they dip below that (and I believe these were encoded with a variable bitrate), I can hear the compression in the high notes of some of the pieces. It detracts from an otherwise superb album. Will most people hear this compression, no, but audiophiles may be a bit disappointed.BOTTOM LINE: Audiophiles, if you really want this album, buy the CD and make your own mp3s."
1,I put this one down halfway thru-I'm not going to finish it.,"...and here's why. Strong sexual content, graphic rape scenes, and crude racist portrayals of both blacks and Jews make this a no-no for my list of recommended reads. I picked this one up hoping for an engrossing tale that I could share with my son, like I plan to do with Mark Twain's, Charles Dickens' and other classic historical novels. I was not expecting pornography! It's clear that Ms. Swerling has done her research, but why she felt it necessary to put her talents to use to produce such a profane, utterly crude novel is beyond me. Perhaps someone reading this review could steer me in the right direction, I'd like to start a collection of modern historical novels, I'm not offended very easily, but this one was just appalling to this reader."
3,A serious reference work?,For a supposedly serious reference work the omission of an index is a major impediment. I hope this will be corrected in the next edition.
3,Poor fit for Lexus RX350,"The barrier does not fit in my vehicle as shown in the photo. I have a 2004 Lexus RX350. The barrier attaches to the vehicle by a small sticky piece that looks like velcro, however in my car it has to attach to a fabric liner, not plastic or the glass windows. I don't know how that will last long term - I've already had one come off. The interior of my car is not symmetrical and I had to shift the barrier off center - which is not a problem, just off center. There is a space of a few inches that remains open between the bottom of the barrier and the seat back and a dog could put their head up there. I'll try attaching the extra sticky and closure to help tighten that area. Overall: I wouldn't recommend this product for very active dogs."
5,Feels and works SO GOOD!,"My son's girlfriend is an esthician and she gave me this as part of a gift. I have your typical ""t"" zone going on - dry all over my face except for the oily ""T"" across my forehead and down my nose and chin. As I've aged, I've had a really hard time finding a product to help maintain a nice balance without it feeling heavy or causing a break out. This is it! My skin (face, neck and chest) feels lucious and looks great when using the marine moisture mask...and here's a little secret - you can even use it as everyday moisturizer when in a pinch. Awesome stuff!"
2,it doesnt work and has alot of scratches,it didn't work and has a lot of scratches.it would go dark once you pressed the start match button.
4,Futures created in an instant!,"A fantastic book, tells I like it is! Lives are guided by instant subconscious decisions, choices made - futures secured or lost in the flash of an eye. As a friend in military intelligence taught me ""success is about people's perception - which often is totally void of reality."" A brilliant book for any Corporate........I specialise in seeing at first glance this book encompasses a well rounded insight into the importance of these skills. TRUITY Williams from Wanabelong.com Australia."
5,"sexy, emotional, love story","Connick was very sexy here. handsome too. the story was slow, but i guarantee you, you'll fall in love with it. i cried somewhere in the middle. love me too, Connick."
3,Alright game.,I love the lion king and timon and pumba. But this game could have been better. I love the sling shot game and pinball. But the hippo hop and the burper game are not the greatest. Its an alright game and its fun to play when you're bored. But i wouldnt pay more then $5 for it.
3,Space Prophecies,"If you like accordion mixed with gypsy-sounding power metal, this has at least one track to your liking. This is symphonic power metal. Sounds like Rhapsody but less thrashy and the strings are replaced with a lot of spacy keyboards. Its some really nice song writing and the soundscape of weird space and future notes is really fun. Olaf Hayer sings really well on this. Luca Turilli is an amazing guitarist/composer, but he sure watch too much sci-fi :)"
5,iron fist in a velvet glove,"I bought it along with the body gel about a year ago. The EDT lasts for about 5 hours, the gel for up to 3. It's the most versatile EDT i have ever had, can EVEN wear it to work (which would be a little too ... but still I could), suitable for all ages (I am 25), doesn't stay too close to the body and can stand its ground in the night crowd (unlike XS or Ultraviolet man), so it gets noticed. At the same time it's not too bold or anything so it doesn't irritate people and is really good from up close (unlike Moschino Friends which I love but is a little too ""noticeable""). I guess some people would say it's just OK because there isn't any REAL strong notes to blow you away, but honestly, why would you want that? It's also complex and ... dreamy, guess the name suits it well. The price is also good compared with some other names."
4,Great space save,"Delivery was great. It's just what I needed. Hides away inside my cabinet. Hides my curling iron, dryer and cords. No more having iton the bathroom counter. Wonderful space saver. I recommend."
2,Needs a better transfer.,"I love this movie, but this transfer is horrible. The brutally abrupt pan and scan cuts literally made my head spin at points. The film is great, and worth watching, but I hope they put out a widescreen version one day. Maybe they'll do a Walter Hill boxed set with deluxe versions of all his classics. Rent this one until they do, but don't spend money on it."
4,HP,"It helps to be a fan of Harry Potter to enjoy this game. It's not an overly difficult game at all. I just completed HP and the SS yesterday and have begun HP and the CS. The graphics aren't all that great, but I did notice that in CS they are better than SS."
2,Sorry to be the bad guy....Weakest worst album yet:(,I didnt think Solwork could make a BAD album either till i heard this one.Where are the solo's?Where are all the harmonies?Wheres the SPEED?I was luke warm to Natural Born Chao's..but it had better riffs and way better song structure's.Most songs here get caught up in the same riff..one after the other.And the chorus's have started to become mundane..very overkilled.If you want real soilwork..listen to the first 3 albums:)Only songz i give a small plus is Figure Number Five and Overload.
2,Powerful for its size. Overheat easily.,"I was looking for a convenient vacuum to clean bare wood floor of a 2 story house plus a few rugs. It did a good job on both bare wood and rug. But it overheat easily, usually before I can finish the 1200 square feet first floor. It will recover and reset itself after cooling down which takes hours. It may be ideal for apartment dwellers, but not so good for house owner. After a year, I gave it to my young daughter who lives in an apartment. I am looking for another light weight stick vacuum for bare floor that would not overheat."
4,makes skin feel smooth,"I love how this product makes my skin feel. Once you put it on, you feel the heat working. Once you rinse it off, your skin feels extremely smooth!!!"
4,Good,Had a enjoyable read here. Enjoyed the way it worked out for the family in the end. Would recommend book.
3,"Good for listening, not necessarily dancing","I have developed a taste for Middle Eastern music while learning to be a belly dancer and enjoyed listening to this CD. However, the music does not fit my dance style and has a more modern tone than some might like."
2,Hmmmm,"The Mpio is a so-so player that can be extremely costly if you want to hold more than 2 hours of music. Its a very sleek and cool looking device with many different options and modes to keep anyone entertained, such as the radio, and voice recorder amoung other things. The real downside to this player is its lack of memory, and upgradability. It costs me nearly 75 bucks for a new sd card. :(. I also own a sony NE-410 minidisc player (also $100) and it has been much better in many cases. It holds 5 hours of music on one 1.50 minidisc. It has served me better than the mpio."
1,"Careful, this is a deceptive pitch","I ordered this based on the image on the Web site. If you are seeing a bottle showing a 40% bonus, and an indication to hurry there is limited supply, you can forget receiving that product. It will be the 8.5 oz. size. This would be okay if they showed the size or indicated anywhere that the image was incorrect. But they don't. I contacted the seller and they said they don't have any control over the image...i.e. caveat emptor. As of this review, the image that no one seems to be able to control, stills shows the oversize bottle.Perhaps a small thing, but that kind of deception gets a one star from me.Still want the product, order it. But now you know."
3,nice perfume,"This is a nice smelling perfume that is a great gift. The bottle is tiny, but it is perfect for the purse or to give as a gift."
5,Awesomness Abroad!!!!!,"This CD is so awesome!!!! Everytime I run out of Prozac or Zoloft, I pop in this little ditty that reminds that my life could've been much much worse!!!It's so good that I lost 2 inches off of my waist laughing at this soo hard!!! K-Fed is the ultimate hardcore gansta rapper. Jay-Z, Eminem, Fat Joe, Diddy,...Diddy ...oh wait scratch Diddy-, but to the rest of the guys, move over cuz K-Fed is gonna stomp on your ground and steal you Popozao."
5,Southern Comfort,"My Brother Michael is as delicious as a large glass of sweet tea on a hot Florida day! Janis Owens is a wonderful writer, with a skillfully spirited understanding of small- town Southern idiosyncrasies. This poignantly told story of love lost and found, captivates the reader immediatly with its wry Southern comfort and charm."
1,Tiny don't buy,This is so small for the money don't buy Not worth it! It couldnt be any amaller!The photo is mis leading ! Very small
4,"Could Have Been 5 Stars, But...","...Gould's writing style in parts of this work is a bit difficult to wade through. His premise, that science and religion can coexist peacefully, is well thought-out and presented logically. And his atheism doesn't show through as a distaste for religion. Rather, he recognizes the deep human desire for faith as somewhat of a given. He argues that science and religion operate in separate spheres of influence. Nature is the domain of science, while religion concerns itself with ethics and morality within the framework of a constantly changing world. Of course, our world would probably be a better place if all of us could accept Gould's proposal. But, in all likelihood, that day is far off."
2,I agree with J.Sell,If you pay this much you should not have to stick the stickers on your self.And my stickers did not even stick so I had to get glue dots to hold the stickers on.
3,Only 4 flavors.,"I only got the soda, cherry, strawberry and strawberries and creme flavor. Regular sized pops. But very disappointed I didn't get more than 4 flavors!"
2,"""GREAT ROCKANDROLL BAND IN OVERDUBBED LIVE ALBUM SHOCKER!!!""","I have been a Stones fan since the age of 11. I picked up an original vinyl copy of this record about 15 years ago, at about the time that I myself started to get together with some guys to play garage rock. I would make tapes of our little teenage band and then dub the scream track from the left speaker of Got Live If You Want It over our badly recorded, oversped, sloppy rockandroll. This is probably the closest we ever got to sounding like The Stones!! This album is intersesting as there are snippets of genuine live backing track which sounds like a band that's about to get pounded by thousands of screaming chicks! It sounds great at times but the very dodgy vocal overdubs ruin the effect entirely. Incidentally, there was an earlier British-only release EP by the same name which IS totally live. This record is great if you can get your hands on it!"
5,Calling all squash junkies!,"When I asked the squash pro at my club if he'd read Zug's book, he turned up his nose. He found much of the material self-indulgent. As for me - a person who took up the sport at a time when many others my age have retired their rackets - I admired the quality of Zug's writing and the way he unraveled the story of the game's evolution. I dug those historical tidbits (did you know the Titanic had a squash court?) and the tales of some of the sport's more eccentric players. Yeah, sure, there were some parts of SQUASH which ""hit the nick and died"" for me, but no big deal. I'd recommend this book to anyone who has been bitten by the SQUASH bug."
3,Awesome sound,"This was a bargain at $99 from an electronics store that gives best buys. I bought it in 2003 and the bass was incredible with my home theater, it really added to the movie experience and it pumped up bass in music too.After just 4 years, it seemed to have simply stopped working for some reason. It still turned on and made some kind of hum when the cable from the receiver was plugged into it, so it did not blow a fuse or burn out completely, but there was no longer any sound coming from it no matter what I did. I replaced it with a different brand, but then found out when fiddling with the controls of my AV tuner that somehow the subwoofer sound (that was controlled by the onscreen menu, not any visible knob on the tuner) was turned down/off. Once I changed the setting, the subwoofer worked fine again. Now I just use it on my extra receiver in another room for another system."
4,"Very, very good for novices and the expereinced","the writing style is a bit stilted and strained at times, but the content is worth the worse than average writing style. Both the novice and the experienced will benefit from this book - it has a little bit for everyone. Especially enjoyed the ""couples"" aspect of it."
2,Toshiba D-R400 Tunerless 1080p Upconverting DivX Certified DVD Recorder,The playback picture brightness went bad after less than a year. Maybe I got a lemon. Unit was decent when it was operating.
1,Nice Color but Utterly Silly,"If overall score was based on the cinematography or transfer of the movie to DVD this would rate high. But the story is utterly silly. Silly too is the acting (it is clear only one actor here speaks English). It is sad when actors need money so badly that they will do something like this. If you buy this it won't be long before you put it on an internet auction advertised as ""viewed once."""
1,What a waste!!,"It should be no shock that this toy was short-lived in stores. I think Little Tikes knew they had a lemon and removed it as soon as possible -- or as soon at the holiday rush ended & they had made their money. It is horrible!! As other reviewers have stated, the sound quality is terrible. Little Tikes should be ashamed of themselves for putting such a poor quality item on store shelves. This toy is junk. I wouldn't even pay 50 cents for it at a yard sale.Follow up/review addendum: As unhappy as I was with this product, I do have to say that Kids Station came thru in terms of customer service. A manager called me back, and kindly offered me a full refund for the product, and sent me a new set of phones! I still give the product itself 1 star, but I have to give Kids Station 5 stars for demonstrating the true meaning of customer service."
4,Calling all Street Fighter buffs...,I must have movie for anyone dedicated to the Street Fighter series. This movie is my personal favorite. I recommend anyone with a thirst for action purchase this movie.
3,Printed in China,3 Star rating for it's printed in China and has a musty smell. Over all it seems like a nice book. Our daughter loves it. Have to find a way to air it out now.
2,Are Klingons just plain boring?,"Is it the Klingons themselves who are boring? Or just novels about them? Though I enjoyed watching Hertzler's interpretation of Martok in the TV series DS9, I found his book tedious and never continued into the second book.Let's face it, although TV and novel scripters try to make Worf and Martok a bit different, Klingons are flat, comic-book Hulks who, in real life, probably would have killed each other off in the Stone Age and certainly wouldn't have achieved interstellar space flight (Romulans or no). Tales of Klingons involve one battle after another, each one as utterly boring as the battle at the end of STAR WARS 1977 that put me to sleep. Their social manners should be kept cooped up inside an insane asylum.They're not quite so boring as the faceless Borg or Jem'Hadar, but pretty close. Give me a complex Trill, Bajoran, or even a post-1991 Ferengi any day!"
2,Could be better,"(Daughter writing review)I was honestly expecting this game to be better. I thought it would be like Colosseum or XD, and I was terribly wrong. There is a story mode to this game, but not to the extent of the Shadow Pokemon games. Really, the main goal on this game is to conquer the many colosseums this game has to offer. I didn't even know that until after I beat them all. I was excited for this game, and when I got it, I had fun. But since I didn't have any of the DS games at the time it was truly disappointing, and the game was basically useless. Except for looking at the pretty graphics and playing over Wi-Fi connection. But unless you have a DS game, you're going to get owned over Wi-Fi everytime.I'm hoping we can get a Shadow Pokemon game soon and nothing like this."
1,this is for the ridiculous price,"13 bucks for 2 songs !!!!!!!!!actually,its 1 good song and a throwaway.and they wonder why everyone is dl'ing............."
2,boring,"Great idea it was to get back at an old girlfriend by selling her memory, but did you have to get back at listeners with a pretty boring set of unmemorable songs?Endless. Maybe I'll leave this disc on the subway."
3,Take care,"The book is so good just take care becouse.....the book says ""Include: Learningkey video trainning"" and this is false the book does not have any video."
1,I would give less than one star if possible!,"I think for those people who gave this book a good review, they are new to the alkalize train and were not aware that this book is nothing more than in infomercial that does not give any more information than most web sites. This book had nothing new or revolutionary to add. It was boring. It was a complete waste of money and as one who suffers from RA I was infuriated at yet another person capitalizing on the pains of others!"
2,To big,This visor clip was listed to be bought with the Cobra ESD7400 radar detector but it doesn't fit that detector.
3,A Fine Historical Romance Set in an Unusual Time Period,"LADY IN WHITE is a quick read set in Elizabethan England (picture SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, minus the depressing ending and spews of poetry). Lady Arabella Purfoy has been maneuvered into a marriage with a reclusive squire she's never met by the Virgin Queen Herself, only to find herself completely heels over head in love with the man's steward.The book doesn't overplay either the relationship between Belle and the steward, nor the political intrigue that surrounded the Elizabethan court before the death of Mary, Queen of Scots.While the book was enjoyable for a light read, and one is glad to see the hero and heroine together in the end, the novel doesn't pack any emotional punches, even at key moments in the story, and there are very few surprizes. Not a work of genius, but a good and satisfying work nonetheless."
4,Limestone Cowboys,"This is one of the best road pictures ever made. With elements of realism, art style cinematography and a great sounding psychedelic country rock soundtrack that drives this film along the two lane highways of the southwest and deepsouth in this modern day western from the late 60's.Truly an american original film masterpiece and worth owning for your film collection."
5,This was great,My Mom wanted this. I couldn't find it anywhere; even here it took almost 6 months before it showed up. She wass tickled to death to get it!
5,MI all over again,I loved it as a kid and now my kids love it. Well made and edge-of-your-seat adventure from a 70's series. Loved it!!
2,Deeply disappointing,"Being a pianist myself, and finding the original 1955 Gould recording a perennial inspiration, I was really looking forward to this new issue. A) the SACD format; B) the new technology of re-performance; and C) the idea of having the static cut out - all attracted me quite a bit. But the actual quality of the product was, from a musician's point of view, poor. None of Gould's energy comes through in the recording. The sound of the piano is also very electronic and does not give a good musical sense. It may be technically true to the strokes that Gould's fingers made on the piano, but musically it simply falls short. I am reselling the SACD and going to clean my original LP for much better musical enjoyment."
1,doesn't look like the picture,This product looked very cool when I saw it on the computer. I was extremely dissapointed when I opened the box and saw that it was a crappy piece of netting that I could have bought at the dollar store. It looks nothing like the picture and definately not worth the money! I would not reccomend this product to anyone.
1,BETTER BUY FOOD FOR HOMELESS DOGS ...Than to buy this magazine,Really nothingOnly adds and very cheap printingI feel sorry that I have a subscription on thatI should buy food for homeless dogs!!
1,Isn't there a minus sign for a rating?,"I bought this VCR...through Amazon.com....There is not an extended warranty offered. My first mistake. The VCR worked for about 3 weeks. When it worked, it was great. I loved everything about it. All of a sudden no picture, just audio. I went to the Toshiba site and found a repair shop that Toshiba recommends. To make a long story short, this is the 3rd time it's been in the repair shop. They told me they replaced the board. Sounds bad. The repair shop STILL has it from the 3rd trip in March of this year. Now I'm back waiting with Toshiba to get a new VCR. The repair shop tried to pawn a used one off on me. Toshiba was very nice at first, now I'm left hanging by the manufacturer. I have an older Toshiba that still works great. That's why I bought another Toshiba.This VCR was a lemon for me. I read the customer reviews, most weren't good, but I purchased anyways.Even more reason to read the reviews.Save your money and possible headaches on this one folks."
3,If They are gonna release also with original soundtrack:,"If they are going to do that, I'm going to buy it too! I already have this one, but I really miss the music. It's a shame they replaced it. The music is part of the tour and were carefully selected I guess. Now in some parts of the series it all seems a bit without the power it had when I saw the series on the network! Truly release it again and shove this one in the garbage bin!Greetings FlorisPS: The episodes are still great!"
2,Overrated,"Where's the heart? Where's the soul? Where's the swing?Sarah Vaughan, Billie Holiday, or even Eva Cassidy are excellent examples of the power of female jazz vocals; Jacintha and Diana Krall are excellent examples of hyped-up marketing with no jazz sensibilities.By the way, the photo appears to show the XRCD version of this disc; the one actually being sold is the much-inferior standard CD. But even the sound of vinyl can't replace soul...."
4,Helpful for the first time mom!,Great for the first time mom who is confused about what she should feed her child. Also has recipes for playdoo and silly putty too.
2,Doesn't work as well as I'd hoped.,"Not sure if I'm doing something wrong, but this tool doesn't seem to work as well as my regular old brush or my tool for getting under fur. Teeth seem too fine for my dog."
1,Data constantly lost,I purchased this drive after reading through numerous positive comments. I am sad to say I have lost data 3 times now and am extremely gentle with the drive.
1,Disappointing,"I purchased this book that I might receive some comfort for the loss of my precious pet and some assurance for afterlife for my present cat someday. I received neither of these as the author rambles on and on about nothing most of the time, cites only a few scriptures in which he doesn't have much opinion on, and leaves me with no hope for animal afterlife. I've read a few other books on the subject and the best one I've found is ""There Is Eternal Life For Animals"" by Niki Behrikis Shanahan. This book details scores of Bible Scriptures that show how much God loves ALL of His creation and proves from these Scriptures that they WILL be in heaven. Most people want proof from the Bible rather than some person's opinion on the subject."
5,This is the greatest comedic standup performance,"This movie is simply a classic. What makes it great is how each bit connects throughout the performance. Most of all, everything Eddie says connects with every type of audience by making fun of real life situations. By the end, you will catch yourself wanting to watch it again in order to commit to memory some of the best comedy ever performed."
1,CHEAP PLASTIC RETAINER BROKE!!!,"I bought this at AutoZone 3/23/11 and it was a hastle from the start. First, I was REQUIRED to spend an extra $30 on Spectre part # 2428 because I needed ONE piece out of it to mount the throttle cable to my valve cover, replacing the stock throttle cable dock. Next, once I installed the throttle cable (which was fairly simple), the plastic end that goes over the chrome sleeve would NOT fit on the aforementioned part (which was THE ONLY logical & reasonable place to mount it), so I had to mickey mouse it with a couple hours of angle grinding. Lastly, on 6/26/11, the P.O.S. plastic connector holding the cable to the pedal failed and left me stranded in 100 degree heat on I-10 heading home. I will NEVER buy another Spectre part again, and I would advise anyone seeking this part to GO WITH ANOTHER COMPANY! Sure, you'll spend more, but having METAL parts COUNTS."
2,Disappointing.,"I have read every book written by Mr. Brooks, met him at one of his book signings, and await with great expectation every new book release. I have to say this was my first real disappointment. The world doesn't need another Steven King. It needs Terry Brooks. I'm sure he gets tired of the same old series and we probably would too eventually. But this was, as one person so apptly put it, ""a real snooze"". Take me to fantasyland Terry, not modern day Illinois."
4,Next to TEN this is second best,"I purchased this album three months after purchasing Ten. Many people who have reviewed this album don't like it and yet I can't see why not. 'Binaural' has some very cool songs on it with one of my favourite songs 'Evacuation' and followed by 'Thin Air'.Okay granted some of the songs are below par but heck the good definitely outways the bad. 'Breakerfall' is a good song, although short for a opener for this album. This album should be given another chance by fans, it is a album that you have to listen to more than once to fully appreciate."
2,Too long to take you to a dull ending,I really struggled with this book. Even took it with me on a flight to China and back and could still not finish it with 12 hours on the plane ride both ways. Finally got it done last week and breathed a sigh of relief. I did it! I finished it! But why? Who knows? The book could have been done much better in about 200 less pages and more tension. I could see early on why Kimmer felt as she did. I did too. Avoid this one. There is too much more out there.
3,descent,It does make a difference in comfort. A good difference but not a problem solver for bad sleeping surface.
2,does include a listing of all available radio stations,"I sent it back because I wanted to find out where Howard Stern is in each city. book includes those old hacks, Don Imus and Rush Limbaugh, even Dr. Laura Schlessinger, but no mention of Howard Stern. With 20 million listeners, why leave him out?"
5,Beautiful Stones,"Turquoise Jasper Round Beads 8mm 15.5 Inch StrandTurquoise Jasper Round Beads 8mm 15.5 Inch StrandThe Chinese River Stone Beads are perfect. These are sound heavy beads with smooth ends and each bead has interesting color variations. They are bold enough to support intricate bead caps. I can combine my beads with pink, brown, grey moss green and black beads to make a necklace."
2,Just yuck,"This book was just too gritty for me, I enjoyed reading these types of books when I was younger but not anymore."
1,"Movie is Fabulous, 3-D is HORRIBLE!!","Do not bother purchasing this in 3D version, the quality is horrible. We were so excited about the possibility of this movie being in 3D because we absolutely LOVE this movie. But the picture was just as bad with the glasses on as they are without the glasses. Just very poorly done and EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING. . . But please purchase this in 2D version! The story is wonderful and it makes you feel like you're on this magical journey through christmas, mesmerizing and fantastical!"
1,THE MOST HORRIBLE CD TO EVER HAVE BEEN MADE,"DONT EVER LET YOURSELF HEAR THIS CD. I washed my hands and face and recited the 23rd Psalm three times after hearing the first track. The ""Family Reunion"" song made me sick--to ever imagine that someone could write a song like that and let children hear it is awful. Teenagers these days are condemning themselves just by buying this CD, and it serves them right if they all don't get to go to heaven. Look what they're bringing this world to.A Christian person would never touch this CD, and I think we should all stand up against the sinners at the record companies who make this nonreligious nonsense. I think everyone who bought this CD should go home and read their Bibles until they feel clean enough to enter a church again and beg for forgiveness. None of this satanic junk should ever be allowed to hit the market, and if it were my choice, not a single teenager who has listened to this CD would go to heaven."
4,"This is a good book, but hard to summarize.","Mama's Bank Account is a good book, but when it comes to writting a summary, it's hard. This is a really touching story and it teaches family values."
2,"Ok, but overhyped","I must be missing something. I was not too much of a Meghan Lindholm fan before she became Robin Hobb, but I must admit I really enjoyed the Farseer books. There is a forced quality to the writing here that does not appeal to me, however. The characterizations lack depth and humanity--I'm sorry--I don't see it. Perhaps it is so wrapped up in the extremes of the fantasy.I am also annoyed that this book did not tie in to the first volume the way it should have."
2,usb connection,"Unit was dead on arrival. I could see the drive about could not access, format, or initialize the drive. If it had worked I am sure it would have been fine."
2,"Great looking watch, but don't buy to keep time accurately","I bought this watch about a year ago. It is a great looking watch no doubt. I was surprised to see that the watch would gain 2-3 min per day! I took the watch back to Macy's where I purchased it, and was told that automatic watches are known for inaccuracy, and 1 minute/day is not unheard of. I called Swiss Army (Victorinox) and they said that they could recalibrate the watch under warranty. I sent the watch in for recalibration, and approximately 8 weeks later the watch was sent back to me. Now the watch runs slow about 2 minutes per day. When you purchase a watch for close to $1000 you expect that the watch will be accurate without daily adjustments.I have finally thrown in the towel and just purchased a Movado Series 800 SubSea watch, that is Quartz based and looks fantastic.If you are ok with constantly resetting your watch, you will be happy, but if you don't want to be late to meetings, etc, then this watch is not for you."
4,Decent trimmer for the price,"This is a decent inexpensive trimmer. It does a fairly good job considering it is half the price of other trimmers. I have only used it a handful of times, so I cant comment on the durability. The only things that I have noticed are the storage pouch and the charger. My old trimmer (which lasted over 10 years) had a drop in charger. Although it is almost identical, this one has a cord that plugs in to the base. Just a minor detail. The travel pouch is junk. Very small and thin. It was in the package folded up and was not much bigger than a quarter. A zip lock bag will probably last longer than the pouch included."
1,DO NOT BUY! RAW IS SO MUCH BETTER,"I give this game a NEGATIVE 2 STARS. The gameplay is slugish and the characters look TOO cartoonish, like a Mr. T cartoon. WWF RAW is much better and I'm sure WWE RAW 2 will be certainly better also when it comes out. AND to make it even WORSE you come out to some generic music, you don't come out to the wrestlers classic theme music. This game is bootleg. PLEASE BUY WWF RAW and/or WWE RAW 2 when it comes out. I'm begging you. Read my reveiw on WWF RAW and HOPEFULLY see why its much better, people say this is better? All you need to do is get the hang of how to play RAW and You'll love it. I admit there is a lack of matches such as ladder matches,TLC matches,Royal Rumble, but this game does not have it either."
3,"""It's all been said before""...""Over and Over"" (The Supremes)","I love Mary Wilson, Diana Ross, and all the Supremes, but how many times must their story be told? Mary has always been my favorite Supreme, but she is overweight these days and doesn't look or dress Supreme. The wigs look cheap and the dresses are way too tight for her frame. What happened to my svelte sexy Supreme? Only her voice has improved with age. Her latest CD recorded live at the Empire Plush Room in San Francisco's York Hotel is simply superb, but only Diana has maintained her Supreme girl figure (while still using way too much make-up!)...the sign of a true Diva Supreme."
2,Not quite sure how I feel about this book,"I am really torn between 2 and three stars, maybe 2-1/2? I was very excited to read this book, the description was exactly the kind of story I usually enjoy reading. It started off OK, then got better, then ended....I think I wanted more. I haven't read any of Jennifer Egan's other books, and if they are similar to this one, I don't think I will."
5,Will make you into a man,"Looking to get so swool? If you answered yes, then you probably aren't doing the most manly of exercises made even more manly by adding weight. If that is the case, buy this belt and look at it while you are doing manly lifts that you could only dream of doing with extra weight. When you have re-acquired you man card and can do these exercise with ease, you may finally bust out the belt.At this time you will notice this belt is a top quality piece, which is what manly men want in their products. The chain is long, because the people at Grizzly Fitness understand that manly men have large pieces of manhood and therefore need to have our weights hang considerably lower than our crotches.CLIFFS:You're not huge. You need to be huge. You need this belt to do so. Stop doing cable curls in an undersized wife-beater in front of a large mirror and order this belt, brah."
4,Good for all stages,"I've taken yoga classes before, but I have to admit that I'm an extremely inflexible person. The great thing about this DVD is that, in addition to Louise Solomon doing the workout, there are three other women, one of whom is a beginner and is pointed out at the beginning of the session. So you can watch her if you're just getting started, or if you're inflexible or have a bad back. Otherwise, there are more advanced variations on the moves as well. Additionally, there is an advanced total body workout at the end that is still quite difficult for anyone in my household to do (yet).The instructor has a soothing voice and explains how to position your body quite well and also tells you what each move does for your body, which is obviously one thing that you'd think you'd miss from doing a DVD at home and not taking a class. I found it quite easy to follow. It's also not too new-agey or anything, so if that tends to irritate you, this one probably won't."
3,Easy to install. Cannot reboot remotely.,"Like a lot of other reviewers, product is easy to install and speed is fast.It's a charm, but only when you're not making config changes.My gripe to share is that I'm using it with a cable modem (Comcast) and LinkSys routers (this is my second LinkSys) need to reboot if i) I reboot the cable modem; or ii) I modify the IP settings of the router.I did NOT have to do this rebooting with my D-Link and Netgear routers.This rebooting itself is not such a big deal. However, the pain adds up because the LinkSys management utility (the one when I go to 192.168.1.1) doesn't let me reboot the router from the screen. That means I have to physically plug/unplug the unit each time I make configuration changes. This is inconvenient since I installed the router in another part of the house, while I work in another room. The management utilities from D-Link and NetGear allows me to reboot the router, even thru wireless.Thus the reason I don't give this 5 stars."
3,Black Swivel Chair,"This item was one screw short. We were able to purchase that screw for just a few cents. Overall, we were happy with the item."
1,Poor sensitivity. No support,"This is a great idea, but a poor implementation. I loved shortwave radio as a kid and this is better. I received my unit in December, 2006, and it worked just fine out of the box, but only if I kept it in the same room as my Wi-Fi base station. When I moved it to my bedside, two rooms and three intervening walls away, it stopped. The signal strength indicator dropped to 0-1 bar. BUT--my Sony laptop resting next to it would pick up and stream flawlessly any radio station, showing 4-5 bars of signal strength. It's clear their Wi-Fi circuitry lacks sensitivity, at least compared to my Sony.The seller replaced it with a new unit. It performed the same. An email to the manufacturer went unanswered."
2,Not Much of a Mystery,"This is a trivial little domestic mystery, part of a series by the same author, set in the fictional Washington State town of Alpine. Although the author depicts the climate and scenery well enough, the characters are stock and the story generates no great suspense. A nasty lady appears in town and begins self-publishing a newsletter that attacks the editor of the town's only paper, the Alpine Advocate, a gal named Emma Lord. Then the newsletter lady is found dead in her hot tub and...the story meanders on til Emma solves the murder. Annoyingly, the author makes her ""heroine"" an allegedly practicing Catholic, who goes to Mass after eating a hearty breakfast, and who has an out-of-wedlock child from her long-ago relationship with a married man. But she has the nerve to sneer at women who terminate their pregnancies as somehow being manipulated by the ""nine old men"" on the Supreme Court who legalized abortion! Sheesh!"
4,Nice introduction,"A pleasant introduction to the subject, easy to read, covers many topics but won't get into too much depth. The author adds a touch of humour to some of the exercises, which is nice, and at the end you'll find answers to many of them."
1,Combat Upgrade... NOT!!!,"SOE's attempt to upgrade the combat system was in fact a total rewrite of 1/2 of the game. Made the game unplayable and extremely buggy. DO NOT BUY this game, or any expansions."
1,sigh...,"what happened? im just perplexed. i like different styles of music & i am all for supporting bands that i like to switch it up a bit & expand themselves. but i still expect the same passion & creativity to come through, even if they banged on some pots or played spoons.i dont want to say anything bad about them, because all these years (its been over a decade) & as the dust brothers, they have continued to please me very very much. ive seen them live 4 times. im just hoping this was a once off & we can get passed it. i've heard rumours that sony kind of pushed them this way but who knows????"
1,I truly wish I had read the reviews here before buying!,"I use some other Norton products, and have been relatively happy with them. However, the Antispam product is the very worst software I have ever encountered. It seemed to work for about 1 hour, then it crashed Outlook. Fortunately, Outlook has something built in to disable bad add in software, which is just what it did with Norton Antispam. Unfortunately, in the process of disabling Norton Antispam, Outlook also disabled parts Norton AntiVirus - what a mess. Do not expect any help from Norton either. They asked be for $70 to fix there two products. I passed. I had to uninstall both Outlook and Norton AntiVirus then reinstall to make it work again. Buyer Beware of this product."
5,Great Air Purifier! Compact and Quiet!,"This air purifier is great for small rooms. It has two speed settings and is very quiet. The ""pre-filter"" is easy to clean."
1,Does not work for me,I tried the 502 in my American Standard 1.6 gpf and it drops immediately like a rock no matter what the setting. I tried it on every setting using a full tank. It closed immediately and did not allow the tank to empty. It just did not work. I tried two of them before I gave up.
1,Dont like,"I dont like anything about this shoe. I ordered this shoe along with a different pair both same brand. Both size 8. This pair was a little too big and the other pair was too small (my foot hung off the back). I dont like the way this shoe looks on my foot. It looks quite ugly...the top, bottom, back.. all parts of the shoe is ugly. And theres splotches all over the entire shoe. Im honestly not sure what color the shoe is supposed to be bc half of it is dark and the other lighter. But its in splotches. I would be embarrassed to wear it out bc it doesnt look right. Dont buy this shoe. Its ugly and it has mistakes."
4,"A very good Intro to ActiveX and VBScript, but ...","This book does a very good job of getting you right into ActiveX, and then slowly adds the VBScript. While the examples on the CD are well documented, I couldn't get a few of them to work (SelectedIndex) for one. However, I would recommend this book as both a good reference and usuable tool. Note that you should have a pretty good understanding of HTML. If you don't, you'll have problems, but the CD has an HTML book on it that is easily indexed. It helped me out greatly."
3,2 of the Same,"When I saw it, it looks like there are 3 different colored boxers, when I got it, it came with 2 of the same."
1,Very Disappointed.,I have a pit bull mix and until her I did not know a lot about the breed. I have been reading everything I can and talking to other bully parents. I have bought several dummy books and always loved them until now. In the first chapter on page 11 of the book I was reading it actually tells you how to fight pit bulls. Yes it's only a small section but it is very descriptive. I am so upset and will never buy another dummy book. As a pit owner I want people to like my girl not worry about her attacking them because Pits are used to fight.Very upset in OK.
5,Classic War Game that is FUN FUN FUN,I don't own a lot of games but those from Blizzard I really appreciate. They have a nice way of capturing the fun of playing games. I liked Diablo but didn't find a lot of replay value. This game was a lot of fun playing over and over again. Why can't more games be this well done? I don't like spending a lot of time learing to get started. This one takes off immediatly and you can continue to learn new strategies several hours later. If I had one game this would be it.
2,Not good for envelopes,Bought the lower tray to print envelopes because we do 10-15 envelopes at a time. Tray worked well at first but now when envelopes print they come out so hot that it seals the seal on them. If you open the back door there are two little blue tabs that if you push them down you can print envelopes without them crinkling....our envelopes still crinkle. A litte disappointed because it would be REALLY nice to have a printer that you can have a spefic envelope drawer and not have any problems and I thought this was the one.
1,not functioning,"I live outside of the united states and bought this radio through a friend who visited the states. when I got the radio it did not work, and a proffesional technician checked it and confirmed that the system is out of order. I wrote a mail to ANTonline service and did not get any answer."
4,Ryan's return,"I really enjoyed the story line. Romance, suspense, & supernatural. I laughed, cried, and felt like I was right there. Would definitely read again."
4,"Good Shirt, For Work OR Play","I bought one of these shirts from a local retailer awhile ago, and found it great for those cool days with an unlined denim jacket over it. It fits me well and has a stylish appearance. All that, plus the durability of a work shirt. I went back to buy one or two more, but found that that same retailer didn't have them anymore. Many local work clothes stores either didn't have them anymore or never carried them. An Internet search came up with some on-line retailers, but with limited colors and sizes. Amazon had access to what I wanted. I recommend this shirt certainly for work, but keep one or two available in your closet for those weekend days with the kids or doing those weekend errands."
2,Slow and not worth your time,"I think this book is more slow than a turtle. When I read the book description I was very interested and I bouth it, but it turn out that this hole book could have been said in just one chapter. I had the impresion that I was not moving on with the story as I kept reading. There was way to much description and no dialogs at all. To coplicatly written and if the author tried to say something here I did not andurstand what it was."
1,Boring Busta,"Busta used to be so damn hype, but this album is pretty booty. False futuristic beats and Busta trying to sound like he's from the south. Why'd he have to get the worst MC to ever touch a mic, P Diddy, on there, too? Wack."
5,fantastic Casualtie's release,"This is the strongest album the Casualtie's have released yet. I have been a fan of the Casualtie's since the Underground Army album and they just keep belting out fierce and raw street punk with horrid vocals only a punk rocker could tolerate. True the Casualtie's have a fashion sense , so did every oi! and street band from 1980-1986 pretty much , and that's basically where their sound is paying tribute too. And i've been a Casualtie's fan for a long time and I don't dress like them and wear GBH patches , and I've never seen Jorge make fun of anyone at a show either..well anyway this release is really good the best tracks are the opening and closing ""Nightmare"" and ""Made in NYC"" (a tribute to Joey Ramone). Up The Punx!!!"
3,not my favorite,"This DVD is just okay. For me personally, I don't like that you need a chair for this practice. Unless you are doing Yoga in your kitchen you have to lug or have someone lug the chair for you. Other than that I like the poses, and Shiva is a good instructor."
5,Charlie Manson-murder--carnage-rape,"ED SANDERS 2/17/1939-poet,singer,social activist,enviromentalist,authorband member-fugs- book store owner-etc.....A wild and crazee man.(written 71/72)***This Book-is the C O M P L E T E story...IN ORDER--OF EVENTS LEADINGUP TO THE TATE-LABIANCA MURDERS *** The years 67/68/69.Then, later- all the scandals,madness,threats,convictions,weirdness etc.True account.A national nightmare.

1,DON'T BUY IT,"CHEAP VERSION OF WHAT I NEEDED.. SHOULD'VE SPENT THE EXTRA MONEY AND GOT THE REAL THING. MAKES THICK SPIRAL CUTS, NOT FINE. USELESS TO ME. DON'T DO IT."
1,Buyer Beware,"While the Skylink G6VR seemed like a great and affordable replacement for my remote as it was cheaper than just buying a replacement remote and receiver I soon found out that sometimes you get what you pay for.This product is cheaply produced, buggy in it's operation, unreliable and is just an all around bad product. It only works 10% of the time, and when it does work it would open and close the door with a single push of the remote not allowing enough time to get into the garage. After 2 days of only working maybe 10% of the time it stopped working all together. Thinking I had just received a bad unit I ordered a replacement and the replacement was just as bad.For all prospective buyers please read the reviews and avoid this product."
3,The Making of a Detailed History,This a remarkable book. Very well written and covers just about everything you want to know about the making of the atomic bomb. I would be happy with a book of half the length and detail. There was simply too much for me to absorb.
2,Good for beginners,"If you have never been to eBay then this book is for you. It will give you the basics of buying, selling, and searching on eBay. If you have any experience at all either buying or selling, then you probably already know the things in this book.I was pretty disappointed in how outdated the book had become in just a short year. Ebay is always changing something, so some of the references are no longer valid."
3,"Sturdy, attractive, but not height adjustable",Very nice looking. Perfectly fit for the 15inch mac. I only use it on the desk and removed the front pad. I just wish I could raise it to higher degrees of elevation at times.
1,This is not a tribute!,"I just listened to the samples, and i can't believe this is real. If your going to cover a blink song a)put some effort into it and b) use PROPER instruments! They are taking the piss out of blink and making idiots of themselves, this is awful it ruins everything about the songs they are 'covering'. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU LIKE BLINK!!!"
1,A bit disappointed,I REALLY wanted this case! I bought it for a Husqvarva 455 Rancher as the product specification said it would accommodate -- the saw body was too big to close the case -- bar length was fine.
2,1950's,"Thats when this book was first written, so it tells you right there it is NOT graphic or very sexual. It is aboout a man who loves his girlfriend so much he makes her sleep with other men, her eyes always have to be down and she is not allowed to talk. THEY lock her up so anyone can have her. She is almost always kept naked, except in the day when she has to lift her skirt up so they can do what they do to her. It's like a S & M book that's very PLAIN not descriptive. If that helps at all."
3,The most disappointing novel I've read in years,"I don't know why I had high expectations of this novel... maybe because the cover was simple and the colors appealing. This story was a corncrib fashioned of mahogany: obviously Frazier crafted his prose carefully and did much research before detailing the natural history of the region he describes. But his endless, almost compulsive storytelling leads one to believe that his story will ultimately be worth the trek through far too many ""seamlessly's"" and animals roasted on ""green twigs"" - and such is not the case. The story's ending is worse than disappointing - it is like a cold shove to the reader's sternum, after having been wooed through hundreds of pages of promising prose. I felt a little pissed off today after having finished the book - I coulda had a McCarthy."
1,Very disappointing,"I found this book of absolutely no help whatsoever in trying to learn the basics of VC++. The examples given are either absurdly simple and repetitive, or completely undecipherable as new concepts are introduced without explanation. Thank God I only borrowed the book and didn't fork out the cover price!"
5,The Sandlot - American Classic,This movie is forever engrained in my head from watching it so many times as a adolescent. It never fails to make me laugh and put a smile of my face. Great film every American and Baseball fan should watch.
5,Wonderful Steve Irwin Figure!,"This is a lovely toy for kids, young and old!! Also, this is great, if you want to collect Steve Irwin memorabilia. I received my Steve Irwin figure very quickly!!"
1,damn wrong investition !!!,"What can I say, the worst way to spent money for something that have to look nice and natural, this eyelashes are something 100% oposite of that !!! Like it's told in the product's name: FALSE FAKE - that's the only truth about this...!!!"
1,Buffalo Tools and You,"I used to work the flea market circuit in the 80's and they were the most rot-gut tools you could buy. The packaging always had inflated pricing on it so you could sell it to your customers and make it look like they were getting a good deal. As I was selling them for a while, I took some home with me. Ratchets broke, sockets got striped, screwdrivers would bend and the tips would be ground down even when matched with the screw and not applying much torque. I vividly remember one screwdriver set had a retail price on it of $29.95 but cost me about 3 bucks."
2,Stiff Sheets,"These sheets when they come to you are so pretty, but they are very heavy and hard. No matter how many times I have washed them they don't get any softer. I have a large capacity washer and they fill it up with the queen size. They are just so heavy, I only use them in the winter, not for using here in the Southeast in summer. They do have a pretty sheen to them and they are a very pretty color, just not SOFT."
5,"Best Notebook on Earth, Hands Down","Moleskine makes the best notebooks, and the large, ruled is my go-to version. The paper feels crisp and clean. There's a pocket in the pack for stowing photos, etc. The elastic strap ensures that the notebook stays closed. There's even a ""Property of; reward if found"" page inside the front cover so that if you lose your notebook when you're halfway done writing your novel, some good soul can return it to you."
1,What Happened?,"I bought 2 of these mugs. Can't tell you when this happened, but one day I heated up my coffee, reached into the microwave and OUCH!!! The handle was so hot, I couldn't pull the mug out. I've used a low-wattage, as well as a high-wattage oven, and the same thing took place. Now, my son uses them for cold drinks. They are useless to me."
5,An amazing CD with an amazing story behind it.,"This is a cd that remains, while others come and go, in my cd changer. Having seen the two play Four Hand Piano at Disneyland many, MANY times, I bought the CD the day it came out and have listened to it more than any of my others I think. Amazing renditions of both classic ragtime tunes and popular music from the 20's (Black Bottom/ Charleston) to the 60's (Alleycat) But this CD and watch your friends get their copies :)"
4,Charming,Its a good story in itself yet not at the grandeur and scale and youthful innocence of the original Phantom of the Opera. The DVD is full of extra features and well worth the viewing for all Phantom fans.
2,Early Death,"I liked these curlers initially, and thought that they would be ideal for traveling, since the set is compact. However, after not too much use, two of the rollers are dead, and I will need to get another set."
4,Good tablet--but beware of built-in drivers,"Good pen tablet--but the drivers that came on the included disk simply don't work with my Windows 7 x64 desktop system.After just a few seconds of using the tablet, my system would crash with a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD). Unfortunately, on the manufacturer's website (UC Logic, the other name for DigiPro), those were the most recent drivers available.I finally uninstalled all those drivers, rebooted, plugged in the pen tablet--and Microsoft found a more recent driver for it somehow and installed that. That did the trick. Now it's working fine with no crashes.Note also that I found the same tablet sold for less on EBay."
1,Way of Zen,This book was received poorly collated: pages missing and in wrong order. I was very disappointed and have requested a refund.
5,...Because I love the original,"The film wasn't that bad. It started off very promising. The first hour was suspenseful, and I had great hopes for this film. After the 60 minute mark, I felt there were scenes that were unfinished, or didn't make sense, for example, after Klaatu escapes, the alarms are wailing, red lights are flashing, the secret facility where the alien-visitor was held goes to lock down mode, Jennifer Connelly is in the lab...then suddenly, she's at home cooking dinner. Huh? They let her go home during an emergency? So many promising scenes just fell flat: the visit with Dr Barnard, Gort the Robot, the ending felt rushed, and not well-thought out. But I can't bring myself to give it only one or two stars. Maybe cause I love the original so much, it would be like slapping an unwanted step-child in the face to pan the re-make. I dunno, I can't explain it, so I'm giving it 5 stars, because I wanted it to be a 5 star film. *sigh*"
3,Blurry pictures,"I use an Olympus C2000 at work, so thought the same brand and highly recommended camera model would be worth a try at several $$$ less....boy was I mistaken. Actually, the D-520 has some really cool features. The 2 in 1 mode and movie modes are very useful. Unfortunatley I can't find a way to change the shutter speed (even though the manual lists about 5 different speeds.)Way too many of my pictures turn out blurry.This has NEVER been a problem with the C2000...I get GREAT pictures every time. I am returning the 520 tomorrow to Circuit City and will exchange for the latest version of my work camera (C-3020)"
3,"Interesting, but oddly organized...",I thought the stories themselves were interesting. But a lot could be done to improve this book. I felt that it was poorly organized and awkward to read through.
4,jack black,I tried looking everywhere for this stuff and it was sold out! i wanted to get it for my boyfriend for christmas..so he hasnt used it yet cause its a xmas gift..but it must be pretty good since it was sold out almost everywhere!
4,Gets you at the end,I had accidentially sent this in a box of books to my husband in Afghanistan. I wondered where it had gone to until he called one day talking about it. He really liked it and said that the end messed (wasn't exactly his word but I cleaned it up) him up.I have to agree. The story is good and the pacing is smooth but when I read the end it brought on the WOW factor.He and I are both zombie fans and we appreciate the different angles authors are throwing into the mix; this one included.
3,Animorphs: Megamorphs #4: Back to Before,"I love the Animorphs series. However, this was not my favorite book. It wasn't very interesting to me. If you are a competely loyal, I've-read-all-the-books-at-leat-five-times Animorphs fan, you will probably like it. I, for one, found books like Megamorphs #1: The Andalite's Gift much better.In the book, Jake gets an offer from the Drode: his master, the Crayak, will make it as if the Animorphs never existed. That Jake, Rachel, Tobias, Cassie, and Marco simply took a different way home. However, there's a catch: the Yeeks still exist. Only now, they don't even know it. They never rescued Ax, and there's no one resisting the Yeerk threat. Things aren't at all like Jake had hoped..."
2,The Zen Toaster,"All this time, I thought it was me!I've had this toaster several years, and have never been able to figure out how to toast both side of an english muffin or piece of bread. One side is well done, and the other is barely toasted; you can see the difference between the two electric grills by looking into the toaster and you can see that one is barely red while the other is bright red. I finally assumed that this was intentional, because it is so consistent. I sometimes flip them over and redo them so both sides are toasted.Also, the two settings knobs that control the intensity of the toasting are unreliable from day to day. A setting that is perfect today will burn to a crisp tomorrow. We call it ""The Zen Toaster"" because you never know each day how it will decide to work."
3,Good Old Fun,"Don't be fooled, this video is old. Still funny just old. I thought it would be a recent video. Earthquake new stuff is funnier. It's worth the money I paid for it."
5,Beautiful representation of mass-production,"As expected from Revoltech, this figure is great! This is the one winged figure and it is really awesome! It's very detailed and well done. When put together with the wings, the figure doesn't fall at all. It has a very good balance. Both winged, non-winged and with different combinations of hands are great! :D"
5,Entertaining,"It is Shopaholic meets Bridget Jones meets ?I really enjoyed the style of writing, it keeps you turning the pages. Quite a fun read. Glad to have stumbled upon it."
5,treehouses!,"This is a very informative book with great pictures. It actually gives specs and dimentions in case you want to build your own. But if you don't, it's a beautiful book just to look at and daydream!"
2,I love ZZ Top.........,"unfortunately, I do not love the sound mix on this. I would really like to hear this concert without the flatline audio. I was relieved to see others having the same trouble with this dvd...I thought it was me being overly critical, or my own equiptment's shortcomings. I found it almost impossable to watch. I was so excited to get this disc too!"
1,Maximum Style offers minimum rewards for readers,"This book is next to useless. The writing is full of adolescent puns, and relies mainly on one or two style advisors for quotes on how to dress. There are plenty of other better books on the subject out there. Don't buy this one."
5,FROM BACK COVER,"ATLAN BESIEGEDIn her quest to save the fabled Atlan, young Cija and her handsome lover, Smahil, flee the clutches of Zerd, the evil half-serpent who has conquered half the world.But, too late, they find there is no escape from their enemy - Zerd's army covers the land from hill to valley; all beings are swept along or destroyed; all cities are laid open to the plunder of his warriors.Now Cija must do the impossible. She must thwart Zerd's ravenous scheme of conquest - and it is the gods decree that she must do it alone!"
3,"Good, but I was expecting better","This is a good, well-made, inexpensive roasting pan. I would highly recommend it, except that it's too thin for my tastes.When making gravy, if you don't watch the pan very carefully, it will burn. This is primarily because the bottom is so thin that it doesn't distribute heat very well, so you get hotspots.I'm also not fond of the rack handles... too close to the pan handles and liable to fall inwards when moving the pan. I've burned myself once when pulling the pan out of the oven: now I'm much more careful.On the other hand, those two caveats aside, this is an excellent pan."
2,disappointed in the smaller count per package,I would normally give this product 5 stars but am disappointed in the decrease in wipe count while charging the same price. I switched to Earth's Best.
5,Review of Peasnt Families in Medieval England,The book arrived in good shape and I am enjoying reading it. The work heps round out my knowledge of medieval times.
3,Nice classic,"I haven't had one of these since I was a kid 45 years ago. It is still fun, but not as powerful as I remembered. If you want power go for stomp rockets! It is hard for a kid to pump it enough to get much distance. An adult can shoot the rocket about 40', my 12 year old only about 15 - 25."
3,Has some great music,"I saw ""The Color Purple"" on a recommendation of a friend and I was presently surprised with the show. The show has some great music (I am here, The Color Purple, Our Prayer, What About Love) but it lacks something. The show feels slow at times and has a tough time picking up steam. The cast is wonderful and extrememy talented but I don't think that the CD really captures the experience of the show in the theater.The CD is a worthy buy if you have seen the show. If you haven't seen the show then I think the listener will be missing out (""Any little thing"" sung by Sophia and Harpo is a great, funny song when performed on stage but not so much on record)"
5,Profound Transformation,"I started Cousen's diet after reading Spiritual Nutrition. It has led to meaningful, tremendous change in my spiritual life. Don't take my word, try it for yourself."
4,Not the best yet... Still a great book worth reading.,"I have read each of the previous four novels in this series numerous times. Each book I enjoyed more the previous. I just did not enjoy this novel nearly as much as the other four. This book simply lacked the adventure and action that Rowling has brought us to expect. This book does a great deal of explaining about Harry himself and his family. It gives a great deal of detail about characters that makes you wait for a big ending that never comes. This book also makes sudden changes to key characters. These changes just occur at the beginning of the book with no explanation. I also, however, see the genious in this book. This novel sacrificed a little of itself to make the next two novels amazing. The sixth and seventh years that Harry spends at Hogwarts will require minimal explanations. The Prophesy foreshadows an ending in the final book that no Harry Potter fan will soon forget. Thank you J.K. Rowling."
5,Swell sequel!,"Rachel reminds me of Stacey McGill from the BSC with a touch of Mary Anne(also from the BSC). Rachel is a math whiz like Stacey and has trouble relaxing like Mary Anne. She's dealing with her loud, obnoxious brother being back home from boarding school and her mother Nell is worried sick about him. Rachel ends up worrying about her mother. I liked how her friends Stephanie and Alison stood by her. Like Mary Anne, Rachel's friends tease her about being nervous. Also Rachel often feels self-conscious about her high grades and being a math whiz around kids who often ridicule ""nerds."" This book ranks up there with ""Just as Long as We're Together."""
2,Only OK,The battery I received doesn't seem to me to hold the charge nearly as long as the original. Bit of a disappointment.
3,Overatedeye,Recently watched this after not seeing it since its premiere in 1995 and it is just plain ridiculous. I cant understand why so many people rated it so highly.
2,You would think...,"You would think that an adapter from the manufacturer would always work, but this one only works in the telephoto range. At wide angles, the tube appears in the frame. Maybe it's only intended to be used with telephoto attachments, but it definitely falls short for filters."
2,Don't know what was expected of it,"I thought it to be funny and interesting but the CD content is more of a complain and regret of the people. Bought it as a present for hubby and it turned into a complain and negligence and incapabilities pointed.I will say it has nothing positive in it,so better not buy for yourself also"
2,"Slow, slow slow","What more can I say (the title says it all). The best thing about this modem is the USR iBand software allows you to see the Tx/Rx info so that you can tell how slow this thing is. Is there really a modem in the box. The iBand software allows me to appreciate how much faster my Apple USB modem is, and that thing is no speed demon. Glad, that I only blew $15."
2,But I loved the books ...,"This was a nice try, but it was a very cheap attempt. I know movies can never reproduce every scene in a book, and often have to change things to convey the feel of the story. But the feel of the movies is nowhere near as intense or emotional as the books. They were ok, but the books were way better."
5,Adult reader gives 5 thumbs up.,"This series is that rarest of events: children's books that enchant readers of all ages. The plots are wonderfully conceived with plenty of twists and turns; the language is beautifully crafted showing a colorful mastery of description; the characters are multi-dimensional, almost real and quite believable; and the creatures...it's hard to find words to describe how magnificent they are. Containing enough detail, and never too much, these books will be my gift to many of my friends this holiday season."
3,Decent. More like a later Entombed album.,"I heard the reviews saying this was a return to thrash for Sepultura. Not so much. I like the album, enough. But, I went back and listened to ""Arise"" and ""Beneath The Remains"", and realized how much intensity this album is missing. I just cannot stand to see a band like Sepultura put out an album with only 4 fast songs. What gives? I like the experimental stuff, but only as filler. The slow, repetitive Native American compositions are not content for a Metal album! Sorry."
2,Not his best,"I'll admit that Paul was never my favorite Beatle. Far from it, in fact, but I always liked his music. However, this album is just badly put together. The booklet is full of typos and his vocals are not the best I've heard from him. Somehow, the whole album just comes across as something he did one afternoon while bored out of his mind.Pass this one up, unless you're truly a Paul fan."
4,Really cute,"I first discovered Hunter Hayes while I was watching Maury on channel 4. He was on the ""Talented Young People show. I thought his Six Years Old song was really cute and I can totally relate to some of his songs!"
3,Regular!,Progressive International Heavy Duty Nut Chopper . Muele demasiado grueso y no se puede regular para cuando uno necesita picado mas fino.
4,Fantastic,"This is a fantastic book, and I really like the fairytale aspect of it... I just wish the ending wasn't so abrupt."
3,weather is meh,Love the big bold time adn the temps work great but the weather condition signal is a bit lame. It shows rain... not when it is raining but when the weather is going to get worse. It would be better if it had different pictures or if it had humidity rather than something that is really rather nonspecific
2,Conclusions are a stretch,"The authors want to believe so much that Washington was a Christian they stretch a lot of evidence, which weakens the book a great deal. Just because someone is in a room where the Nicene Creed is recited doesn't mean the person believes every word of it. Washington was more than a deist for sure, but simply using the word ""Providence"" many times in life doesn't make one a Christian. Perhaps Washington was, in his heart, a Unitarian, which is much different than a Christian. ""Providence"" can have a diverse range of meanings depending on the individual. I just don't get the obsession with making Washington something that he's not."
1,Nothing but pornography,I so appreciate the female actress in the Bond film with Craig. She made for a great villian/heroine. And the banter between the two was great. Loved it. And I am glad I saw her in that movie first. Because this movie was just disturbing. It was graphic. It was just porn trying to be art. And if you don't want to take my word for it seek out an interview she did where she was asked about this movie. She said she couldn't even watch herself on the screen.
4,New but Old,"As soon as I heard the first single(Here to Stay)from KoRns new album I new it was going to be good, and I wasn't disapointed. This album is harder than both Follow the Leader and Issues, however their self-titled is still the hardest. This album has elements from all of their other albums but is different. The music feels like their first cd but the coruses feel like Issues. The emotion is gone from the songs, but that is no reason to not get this cd."
5,Sturdy OEM replacement,"I go through these belts fairly often and of all the different replacement belts I've used, these are the best."
4,classic movie,When movies where done well and told great storys. Well told and very enter taining. When stories told some thing not like current movies where they just want to show gun fire to move the story forward.
2,So much potential . .,"I normally don't write reviews, but this time I felt it was important. The Sims 2 is a GREAT concept, I really enjoy playing the game, but the minimum system requirements listed on the box are completely made up. If you want to be able to enjoy this game, you need at least 512MB of RAM and a GeForce 3 or better or Radeon 7200 or better video card with at least 128MB of RAM. You should also have a fast CPU. 800mhz might work for you, if you don't mind choppy game play and you add in some extra RAM and/or a better video card. Trust me. This game cost me $200 after I did all the necessary hardware upgrades to play it, and my system met their minimum specs before I started."
2,Great Holiday Music by Michael Buble,"The music in the book is great but it's very hard for me to play. I'm used to a regular right hand and a regular left hand. The way the music is in the book is for a vocal accomponiment or something. I haven't played the piano in a while and I thought, since I love Michael Buble's music and especially wanted the music to ""My Grownup Christmas List"", which is beautiful, I shouldn't have too much trouble playing it, but it's just not what I expected. I can make something out of the right hand and some of the notes for a left hand but it's not really giving the music the right sound. Unfortunately, as I was looking forward to this music book, I thought it would be different. But, if nothing else, I DO have some form of the sheet music for my beautiful song, ""My Grownup Christmas List"" but it's somewhat of a disappointment. ""White Christmas"" doesn't sound like ""White Christmas"" the way this music is set up either."
4,Through Generations,"I first heard this book as a grade school student, then I read it to my childern, now I'm buying it for my grandchildren. This wonderful adventure spans the generations.Thank you,Madeleine L'Engle"
2,"A case book, not a textbook","This book was a disappointment. A real textbook would actually have instruction. This book is merely a collection of cases, with a few scattered chapters on VC/PE. Only buy the book if required to for a class."
1,"Please, follow the advice in this book...","This convicted felon is brazen in the unethical, unscrupulous, and (in many local jurisdictions) illegal ""advice"" he spews forth. A lot of it is just plain stupid, so, if you'd like to be a slumlord-cum-convict, be my guest.For more information on this criminal, see the Washington City Paper, July 15, 2005, pp. 11-12."
4,Nice replacement for older models.,"I had a older model cordless Dremel. The battery pack finally gave up the ghost, and I decided to get myself a new dremel. Looking around I found this one, I amm usually skeptical unless I can hold it. Well I had some plastic models that were crying for attention, so I bought this model.I was pleased with the new grip, and had no issues with the control like some others. It ran a bit faster than the old model, but that could be because I was used to the dying battery pack. Be careful if you are using this on plastics that could burn under high speed grinding.The tool did what it was supposed to do, and it does it well. Those who cling to comfortable old tools have nothing to fear with this upgrade."
3,"Not great, but not as bad as some think","I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could. It's definitely not a 5-star film, but it's also not a disaster. I disagree with the reviews that criticize the CG effects, which seemed as good as any to me. I also felt that the acting was quite good overall. My main objection was the inconsistent tone of the movie, with comic remarks being injected in scenes that were otherwise dark and forbidding. At times, this worked quite well, but at other times, it just fell flat. Still, it was obvious that the actors and the director had a great time making the film, and their total involvement was the film's saving grace. There was a great deal of time and talent put into the project, and that it fell somewhat short of the goal is no crime."
1,Over-Rated,"Nas is a below average MC. Hova is the G.O.A.T--end of story. Dont waste your money on this--buy Blueprint, Unplugged, and Best of Both Worlds instead."
4,Reliable Modem!,"I have been using the Motorola modem for couple months now. Overall I am happy with the modem It is reliable and I hadn't any dropped connection throughout the house. The only shortcoming was the complicated set up, it took me a while to get it to work with my other devices."
1,Noise in the Picture,"I ordered two of these 15ft HDMI cables because there were numerous positive reviews and the price was very low. When they arrived, I plugged one in where I had temporarily put a 6ft HDMI cable. Immediately, the picture began to include noise. Every so often, a whole section of picture would flicker with no information and then back to normal albeit still noise filled. I tried the other cable and the same effect occurred. Finally, I replaced the 6ft cable I had bought on Amazon years ago, and the picture returned to normal."
5,YOUR CONCERT IN MEMPHIS WAZ THE BOOM WE WANT U TO COME BACK.,JUVE U THE BOOM ALL OF YA'LL ARE THE BOOMI LOVE YOUR CD AND WHEN YOU DID THAT VIDEO WITH TEAR THE CLUB UP THUGS THAT AS THE BOOMYA'LL DID THAT VIDEO OVER BY OUR SCHOOL PLAYA WHY U HATING THAT WAS TIGHT.YOUR CONCERT WAS THE BOOMYOU GOT IT CRUMP IN MEMPHIS THEN THE AFTER PARTY AT DEMIN AND DIAMONID THAT WAS THE BOOM
3,Great Title; I'm 49 with no children...,"I lost a lot without college educated parents. Just graduating from college with a BA degree is harder work too. And then finding that career to raise a family as well? Put your shoes in my place for those who had more privilage. I see dads taking their kids to games, the park, the zoo, vacation, etc. I got none of that! You know who taught me to ride a bike and learn to swim like other normal kids? Nobody! Mom didn't ride a bike swim either. Weird. So, I never learned those things and still don't enjoy those leisures today as a grown man."
2,GREAT TOPIC but to repative,I have read five of the Elm Creek novels and enjoyed all for different reasons. This one I can't say was that great. The author kept repeating the facts over again with each character and it began to get very boring. I wanted to skip sections and move on. I would have prefered more quilting tips and information regarding quilts and less scandals.
2,colloquial portuguese: the complete course for beginners,The book is very good but the CDs that accompany are not. The portuguese is spoken much too fast for a beginner.
5,One of the best purchases....,"...I've ever made. These speakers (including Aperion's 12"" sub) are incredible. I've got the 7.1 setup teamed with Onkyo's DS898 A/V receiver and have been rocking for nearly 8 months. It doesn't matter whether I'm watching ""Fight Club"" or listening to Boney, the sound is always impeccable. They're beautifully constructed and while not made of solid hardwood their veneer is much, much better than any vinyl-wrapped speaker I've come across. The construction is solid----each satellite weighs 11-12 lbs. Sure there are better systems out there. I seriously doubt you'll find a better one for the price. To top it all off the Aperion sales folks are the BEST I've ever dealt with---in any line of business (that includes USAA Insurance and Banking, who are unbelievable!). You just can't go wrong with these speakers."
4,The solution should not be printed below the diagram.,"For Sam Lyod, the chess puzzle king, there is no need to comment. But one thing annoys me is that the solution is printed under each puzzle diagram,so one either set up the problems using a chess sets, or have to cover the solution hoping not to see the answers unintentionally. This would make the reader very inconvient!!I don't understand how such obvious thing the publihser should miss!!"
5,new parents love it.,"The techy-and-detailed couple love it, which really means something although their baby is too small to try it. Will update the review after real field experiments with its normal user. :D"
3,It was OK,"This movie was OK. It was kind of corny to me, but it kept my attention. It reminded me of a lifetime movie."
2,3 of 8 Discs Were Defective!,"This problem may be varying from set to set and disc to disc, but the discs for ""The Lodger"", ""Rebeecca"" and ""Spellbound"" all made noise as they ran in the disc player. The other five were fine and all 8 of the discs have good visual quality. But for the first time in the years that I've ordered DVDs from Amazon I am returning a set, and I'm not seeking a replacement because it sounds like too many of the sets out there are defective. What a disappointment -- I've been waiting for the 3 British films in the set to come out in good transfers. Fox needs to do a recall and reissue this at a later date when the problems have been resolved."
5,Great value on an anti-frizz product,"My hairstylist got me into this product. I've been using the Smooth Down Shampoo and Conditioner for a few months now, and unlike with other products, I don't find the need to rotate in different products. I use these over and over.The conditioner is light and keeps my hair from getting weighed down. I'm able to wash and condition with these products, style my hair straight, and leave it for 3 days before I need to wash it again. These products get it clean and keep it healthy enough to avoid the drying effects of washing every day.Give these a shot if you have color treated or just plain frizzy and dry hair."
5,Xikar Cutter,Works exactly as claimed. I am very pleased with this purchase just as I am with all the Xikar products I have purchased.
4,"""There's Better Music Out There But You Don't Want Us To Know!""(Calibretto 13)",Green day is a vary talented band so why did they just get popular with this cd. They had many great cds. Green day is good but isnt the best. Im not putting them down its just the people who listen or say they listen to them because they are the so called (GREATEST). This is a good cd put please listen to other things and dont follow the growd and listen to what they are because there is other music out there. Thank you
4,Beware multiple orders,"Batteries came promptly and were fresh but I ordered 5 and not all had safety caps as shown in the picture. This left the possibility of contact between adjacent batteries with no cap and risk of fire or battery damage. The caps did not come off - they were not even in the package. Hopefully, they will read this and remedy the situation at shipping."
5,The one book that stands alone in my memories of childhood,"This was one of my favorite books as a child and I have passed the book on to my daughter. The pictures and story are excellent accounts of the misadventures of children, human & animal alike. Every mother with a small child can relate to the mischievous & innocent thoughts of wanting to eat more than they care to pick"
2,The fourth coming of a very medicore game.,"The graphics are super pretty, and the talking characters remind of my friends except they are very strange looking. There is a girl in a bar in this game and I want to date her but she isnt really so im super depressed now. I got a sword as an assassin and i got heavey armor adn the graphics are beaute, but i cant help but to think that microsoft really dropped the ball on this game. What a piece of garbage, its so contrived, everything about this game screams ""been there, done that!"" I hope all of you heed my warnings about this terrible game, however I give it two stars because the graphics are like to die for baby!!!"
4,A Triumph of the Human Spirit,"This novel is not only about the conquest to defeat Mt. Everest, it is about the strength of the human spirit.While attempting to top Mt. Everest 10 climbers come to grips with their weaknesses and strengths. They come to understand about morality and the things that are truly important in this life.This novel was a good read on several levels."
2,I'm glad I rented it first!,"I don't do many reviews but I can tell you that this game is extremely boring! Quests and jobs and plot, why do you have to do the same job for an hour. Seriously who wants to be a blacksmith and hit a target for that long?! I just purchased my Xbox 360, and I am really glad this was a rent and see instead of blowing some major bucks! If you have a lot of time on your hands it would be great, but other than that, don't bother!"
5,Good Book for 3rd Graders,"The book Lucky Lottery is a good book because it is interesting to read about the mystery. The book is kind of hard to read, but it is fun to see what happens next. We recommend this book."
5,"This is ten times better than "" Star Wars - Episode 1 "" !!!","This was a movie that I enjoyed, thoroughly, and completely ! When I was thru watching it, I wanted to see it again. I was thrilled at the protagonist's boyish enthusiasm, which turned his dream into reality. This is a heart warming story, that will get under your skin. This is a film that you won't be afraid, or ashamed to take a friend, or family member to. I wasn't impressed with the latest Star Wars, big budget hypefest; but this is a movie that I will enjoy watching, over and over again !"
4,Fits my generic import sander,"I have a generic spindle sander from taiwan. Pretty similar to the jet machine (perhaps even made in same factory). Purchased these sleeves and they fit my bench mounted generic unit just fine. Note that these sleeves are available in two lengths, one for smaller bench mounted machines and one for the larger floor standing spindle sanders. Make sure you get the correct sleeves :)"
1,"Concepts, not reality","I read a lot of business books. The best present lessons rooted in empirical data, real-world case studies, and personal experience. This book has none of these. The authors present a number of common-sense hypotheses and back them up with a long-running hypothetical case study - a made-up company that exists only to reflect the authors' ideas. Add to this the tedious consultant-speak and the dated examples and there's no reason to buy this book. Except that it costs $2 used."
2,Be weary,"This is not the same quality as the Futurama of old. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that they are just warming up for the other DVDs, but this one was disappointing.The movie seems to suffer from the same problem as The Simpsons. There were still some funny jokes, but they weren't topical. Too many of the jokes were just paying lip-service to funny episodes from earlier in the series and didn't add anything to the story. Also, far too many plot twists. I understand that the movie was intended to be split into episodes, but it felt like different people worked on different parts and just tried to stitch them together.I had to turn the movie off a little over an hour through, but I did watch it a second time and I started to feel a little better about it. I still don't think that I'll be watching this movie with anywhere near the frequency I watched the original episodes.Here's hoping the next movies are back on track."
5,#1 GAME IN AMERICA!,"I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!!! THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER MADE!! IF YOU DONT HAVE THIS YOU MUST GO OVER TO THE STORE AND BUY IT TODAY AND IF YOU DONT I WILL HUNT YOU DOWN AND RIP YOUR GUTS OUT (no! no! im just kidding!) THIS HAS ONE OF THE BEST GAME STORY LINES I HAVE EVER PLAYED (along with FF7, FF9, and more.)THE GRAPHICS ARE SUPURB, THE SPEED IS AMAZING, SONIC AND OTHERS NEVER LOOKED BETTER(they finally took away his chubby litte kid look and made him a teenager), A-LIFE IMPROVED, THERE ARE MORE ANIMALS AND MORE! IF YOU ARE A CLUELESS PARENT AND DONT KNOW WHAT TO GET YOUR CHILD THIS IS IT! (make sure he/she has a dreamcast)"
3,Worth One Viewing,"Beautiful photography of picturesque Heidelberg and the Technical University of Munich, another perfunctorily plausible performance by lead Franka Potente, assiduously crafted models in gruesome imitation of plasticized corpses and a handful of ingenious quirks can't overcome the fundamental silliness of Stefan Ruzowitzky's hit medical thriller. Seldom fearsome yet agreeably enjoyable, it's at least a couple rungs above most contemporary horror schlock, and an adequate amusement for an Autumn evening."
4,Was brand new,The product was shipped fast and was in perfect condition when it arrived. Had the plastic wrap still on it and everything. i got it as a gift for my dad and he loved it.
1,More sensitive than a spoiled child,"The ADC Advantage Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor is easy to put on, start, and read but ridiculously sensitive. So much so that if you pay attention to its readings you will end up with high blood pressure even if you don't start out that way. Unless you sit with the monitor exactly level with your heart or lie down while taking your reading, the monitor will almost certainly give you a high reading. Stand while you use it and the reading may convince you to call 911. Of course one should sit still, relax, all that good stuff while taking a blood pressure reading, but this monitor forces you to a degree of stillness that is almost mummy-like.I love the idea of the convenience and size of a wrist monitor but this model is just too fussy for me."
4,A must for any DC fan!!!!!,"This is all the best songs from Dawsons Creek in Season 4. Any DC fan will appreciate it. If you own Songs from Dawsons Creek Vol. 1 then it'll seem familiar to you. There are 14 tracks all pure dawsons creek, by various artists, some popular some unheard of. It's a good chance to explore some great artists who you would otherwise probably not hear. It is definately worth listening to and even non dawsons creek lovers will enjoy the good mix of brilliant music. Give it a try!"
1,Disk has no scratches but doesn't play.,The disk is very clean and has no scratches but there appears to be some sunlight damage or laser damage to the disc so it wont even start up. I am very disappointed with this company for not trying the game before sending it out. On a higher note i had a second game come from this company that is clean and scratch-less but unlike ratchet and clank plays like its brand new.
2,Pedometers & the Disabled,"I bought this item for my wife, who has multiple sclerosis. She's trying to keep track of her walking distances and the number of steps she takes. Because her gait is awkward, by normal standards, and her pace is very slow, the Omron device is not able to accurately track her steps or distance. Although the unit works fine (I tested it myself), it does not work for the person who wanted it and could have benefited from it the most."
3,American Greetings program,"I;had a newer version of creatacard on my old computer. When my son bought me a new computer, we could not find the original disc to install it. I only used the program for the reminder program so I wouldn't forget birthdays, anniversaries,etc. The version I received had a different reminder program which isn't the same type. I will still keep looking for the software I had on my old computer."
2,Wasn't What I Expected,"When I bought this I thought it was going to be simply a modernized version of Andrew Murray's edition. I now find that Dave Hunt ""draws upon several of Law's other books, including his well-known ""A Serious Call..."".When I buy a book, I don't need the editors idea of ""improving"" it. I want the book as it was written. I would not buy this book again regardless of how ""good"" it is because it isn't authentic. Very unhappy. (I've read ""A Serious Call"" and loved it.) If anyone can tell me of a legitimate copy of this book I would appreciate it."
4,It is an overall very useful and interesting book on wicca,"This is book is targeted to the wicca beginner and in that sense is very helpful. Although, I didn't really agree with what the beginning implied about religion and how it seemed like you had to be solitary or in a coven. However, as I read through the rest...I thought it too be really an awesome book as far as concise summary of different rituals, spells, gods, symbols and witchy holidays."
1,They always break,"These are good enough for what I need in headphones for walking around, but they always break. I mean, I understand that everything will eventually break - but things are only inexpensive if they last a reasonable amount of time. If these cost $15 and you need to buy 4 pairs a year, compared to ones that cost $25 and they last two years, the latter are the less expensive pair.Being cheap, I would prefer if these would just not break so easily - and it isn't that I'm being rough with them - I treat them well, but eventually they die (usually the sound goes out in the left ear).I am no longer going to get these, fool me... 4 times. Doh!"
2,"Not much new info for me, but good for younger person possibly","The first couple chapters were interesting, but then it seemed like something I might have found useful about 15 years ago. If you have read any of the more popular PUA books or social dynamic stuff, this is way on the novice end in comparison. Also it is co-written by a woman, so if you are interesting in using it to meet women, it is mostly useless. There were some good bits of info, such as what men find attractive vs what women do, but seems like a better read for a high school age person just learning to talk to girls."
3,Was hoping for better,"We registered for these for our wedding. I saw them at Bed, Bath, and Beyond. I have this thing about making sure the forks are really pointy. These really were. The ones we got are too! I love this abut them. They are really pretty out of the box and have a very simple style. When opening them I noticed that they were made in Vietnam (in case this is an issue for anyone). It has been about two months since we started using these. The one thing I don't like is that the knives are starting to loose their finish. I was expecting better quality given how much these cost. However that was not meant to be I guess. The rest of the silverware is doing just fine, but I don't know why the knives are this way. Hope this helps!"
4,Great Product for the Price!,"Wanted great tasting cappuccinos and lattes without the headache sticker price of most espresso machines. Foamer works great (could be longer, only complain) and shots of espresso come out perfectly."
2,not the best,"This has got to be the hardest 'gel' I have seen.. I was hoping this seat was going to allow me to ride without using bike shorts.. But no, I still need the shorts, even after a couple of miles."
3,REd Dirt Girl,"I can still remember the first time that I heard Emmylou Harris on the radio. Although this would be a good CD for any other artist, it is simply average for her. She took country music back to its roots AND explored new territory all at the same time. Emmylou is best in a spare acoustic arrangement or a very traditional country arrangement. Her exploration of alternative music (but the phrasing and themes are still very much country) makes her seem insipid, very much like an alternative Shania Twain or Faith Hill. I can't believe that the vapidness of contemporary Nashville and country music radio causes her to go in this direction. ... ."
2,caveman,the dvd case seemed original or maybe a coloured copy but the dvd itself seemed to be a copy. There was no picture or other sign of originality itself on the actual dvd
2,Very Basic,If you are looking for a first cheer DVD this would be it. We found it repetitive and felt it had way too much talking.
4,Bad paper cover but good in content,"The paper cover is bad, not well glued to the paper. However, I bought this book as it has high star rating and I find it so. Then, I agree with others who gives high rate but I truly disagree with the quality of paper cover finishing."
4,Preschool Class,"I currently have this toy in my preschool classroom. The age of the children range from 2.9 to 5 years. They all absolutely love the spooky theme for Halloween. After a few lessons from the older children the younger ones have figured out the pattern of movements to be done before the car can roll all the way down.I have to be honest, I paid nothing for the toy, I found it at my local dump! Not sure if the previous owner hated it but we are truely enjoying it!"
2,bizarro bizet,"Have any reviewers mentioned yet that this opera is supposed to be sung IN FRENCH, not Italian? And, yes, cut#7 on CD #2, although listed properly in the liner notes, is some English song that has nothing to do with this opera. (I was listening to this coming home from work very late one night, and was convinced I'd finally gone around the bend, so strange was the effect!) And the soprano, Magarini,is majorly annoying. However!!!! Alfredo Kraus defies description,as always, and is so beguiling(and precise in diction, pitch and rhythm)that maybe you should buy this CD anyway."
1,"Half thriller, half ""global warming doesn't exist"" = a mediocre book","This book has the makings of a great thriller but there are dozens and dozens of pages where characters blather endlessly about global warming facts, statistics, and bad science. For me, it became unreadable and I never finished the book. A rare act by a fan of Crichton's other works."
5,my daughter loves everything Clifford,Another addition to our growing DVD collection....cant go wrong with anything Clifford! I love that the videos are long and provide multiple episodes.
1,"I'm sick of these ""Tribute To"" albums.","I hate these ""tribute to"" albums. It's just bunch on Wannabe's trying to someone's music. I'm sick of these American idol rejects doing these ""tribute to"" Albums. The Original Artists are better. I do not like Justin Timberlake as a musicianbecause of his girlie voice but These ""Tribute to"" Albums make it sound a whole lot worse."
1,Did I Get Some Little Kid's First Woodworking Project?,"I realize that this is not a top-of-the-line item, but is it too much to ask that all of the holes attaching the doors and hinges not be stripped? It takes awhile to find all of those tiny screws when they're rolling around the box. Also, could just one of the pre-drilled holes be positioned correctly? Just one, please?As may be read in some of the other reviews, the darts are laughable. If the buyer is willing to do a little bit of repair work while putting it together; doing the work that a manufacturer generally does with even the most economical of merchandise, and the cabinet is not going to be the focal point of your rumpus room, knock yourself out."
3,Name of a song,Does anybody know the name of the song when Napoleon is riding with Pedro's cousins while going to the dance?
5,So happy to find this CD,"I was so happy to find this CD. It was part of a birthday present for a close friend, who loves all of the early songs of the 50's and 60's. She was very happy with this CD. I would buy from this seller again."
5,My Favorite Harry Potter Book,"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince happens to be my favorite of the Seven Books. What I like best is the insight it gives into the character of Snape, and the fact that we we learn something about his childhood, and what he was like as a student at Hogswart. It also outlines some crucial plot details and explains many unanswered questions from the previous books."
5,Fantastic!,"I recently discovered Maria Mena and she has quickly become one of my favorites. To me, her style is a mix of Kate Voegele musically & Pink lyrically. Her lyrics are spunky and not just the typical sappy love songs, and the style to each song is different throughout the CD. My favorites on the CD are #4 (Blame it on Me) and #7 (What's Another Day). It's mostly upbeat with a few slow thoughtful ones (Especially #11, Sorry). Enjoy the CD!"
3,"It's ok, but not what expected","The level looks sturdy and works fine, the tripod is useful addition.However, the description was not clear enough, I think. It says there is laser chalk line and a beam splitter to 90 degrees reference. I expected having two perpendicular laser chalk lines.But the line can be seen only if you use that head, if you use the splitter, there are only two tiny dots projected, no lines.You can't use the chalk line an the splitter together and because that's what I need I returned the product.I have no big experience with the laser levels, so it was also surprising how relatively wide is the laser chalk line, it's not enough precise for my purposes, there are several millimeters tolerance in t.Otherwise it seems ok."
2,So whats the big deal!,"Well I have been hearing of this lost pop group for about 3 years now in various circles and underground music puplications. So I read the reviews in these pages and decided to finally order a copy of Big Star #1 Radio City. Boy was I disappointed! I even put myself back mentally to 1971, I was 17 at the time and I still heard just a ton of unstructered hap hazard cliche licks and 22 tracks of filler between the two good cuts."
3,Just okay,"The watch itself keeps good time, I love that it never needs batteries, and the backlight is decent too, I like that you can have it come on by just raising your wrist to look at the face of the watch. What I dislike about this watch is the crystal scratches way too easy so I have to put it to an electric bench buffing wheel about every three months to polish the scratches out. The band is cheap and started cracking, finally broke in two after only two months of wearing it."
4,It Ain't Nothing Wrong With A Big Woman,"Me being a big woman myself I loved this CD. I say keep up the good work for our image. Because truely there is nothing wrong with us, if anything we get all the glory for being ourselves. We're Big Beautiful and know how to have fun and fun to be around. You say party and we know how. Lots of love for this artist."
1,...,"Well here we have anouther cd with deppressing, sreaming, guzzling lyrics. I just wanna say STAY AWAY FROM THIS ...ALBUM."
5,These are the best books I have ever read.,"These are the best books I have ever read. They have interesting characters, storyline, everything you could want in a book. It is not only a fantasy book, it is a adventure book."
3,"Murphy's Law - a good disc, but I expected more","This disc is just an average rap cd, nothing spectacular. It just shows that most superstars proteges have a hard time doing it on their own. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I really wanted more from Murphy Lee. However, he's young and I'm sure there will be more to come from him. A good disc for a true hip hop fan, but not for the average fan."
1,Doesn't work - bugs walk right over it and don't get stuck!,The trap does not work. It seems to attract bugs but they just walk over it and keep on going...they don not get stuck.
1,2012 Olympic Gymnastics,I was expecting much more e.g. the top 5 on each apparatus. Lots of pommel-horse and very little else. A waste of money.
2,Quality Is Doubtable,A few years ago I bought a full room of JBL speakers from center to subwoofer. All worked perfectly for few years(I am not the daily users of the system but once a week at most) until one day I heard disturbing noise from the subwoofer even before I turned on the receiver. I readjusted the receiver and the subwoofer as well as replaced the connection cable but all did not help. Now I have to find a different one for replacement. This time I will not do with JBL.
3,"Jewish Backgrounds of the New Testament, Kindle version","I purchased this required book as part of my Master's degree program, and as my first attempt to use my iPad as an eBook reader. Although I think the concept will have its place under certain circumstances, it's not working for this application. The content of the book is very good. It reads well and is very informative. The real problem comes in when your Professor tells you to read pages 23 to 177, and you find out your kindle version of the textbook has no page numbers. Also, this makes the Index totally worthless, as well as references to other pages within the context of the book itself. Apparently this problem is being addressed with some of the eBooks, but many still do not have the page number feature. If you are buying this or any other book for class work or research, you better check to confirm the page numbers are available in the kindle version, or just buy the hard copy!"
2,Totally agree with last review,"Of the 6 books1 and 2 are wonderful3 is ok4 is very good5 is ok again6 is awful, clearly was written without reading books 2-5, destroys the continuity, is confusing, and just bad."
5,Thanks,"Works great, went on the internet to find out how to pop ipod apart and it took like 10 min and saved me $150 because i didn't have to send it in to apple. Thanks"
1,Hostile nonsense,"Written in the late Thirties, this book is a misguided attempt to interpret Robespierre as a precursor to Hitler and Stalin. It is a complete distortion of the aims and goals of the French revolution. Interested readers should pursue histories by Thompson, Hampson, Jordan and Rude instead to get a more accurate portrait of Robespierre"
2,Unrealistic and Boring Murder Mystery,I found it to be boring and totally unrealistic for a cookie baker turn dectective. It was not even funny at all. Took I could to finishReading the story. The only best part were the cookie receipes which I baked to try them. Don't waste your money !!!
5,Great book!,I could relate to the main character even though she was much younger than I am. She was searching for the ultimate forgiveness and peace. An excellent read!
1,I think this is horrible,I found this variety of Tassimo coffee pods to be undrinkable compared to some of the caffeinated varieties. It's like cheap diner coffee. Going in the garbage.
4,Not was I expected,"This is my first Amanda Ashley novel. I normally don't care for stories set in older times but I love vampire novels so I thought I would give it a try. I'm glad I did. It's a very good romance. It could use a little more depth to the story but a good read. She does very well with description, giving enough to set you in the room without overpowering the story. I will definitely be trying more of her books."

2,"OK for VERY short term use, not more",I had a batch of these. Don't bother to burn mp3's on them. They last for about a month (of occasional play). It's OK if you want to temporarily store data. That's about it.
4,"Motorola HT820 - Great Stereo, OK phone headset","For music playback, this headset is great. Sound quality is rich and full, volume is fine, battery life works great for me. It effectively covers office noises. I also love the fact that this headset handles both music playback and being a headset for my phone. Unfortunately, while the sound is fine for the headset portion, others on my calls consistently report that I sound very quiet and am hard to hear. I like a phone headset that doesn't require me to speak up much more than I would if holding a phone handset, and with this headset I have to speak forcefully for others to hear me well. For this reason I consider the HT820 to be a great stereo headset, but as a phone headset it's just OK."
5,All the kids at our Christmas gathering wanted one,"Bought this for my grandson, as am always looking for something different and this toy exceeded all my expectations. All of the kids at our Christmas gathering wanted one, so of course, all the parents were scrambling trying to find one. Unfortunately, all stores were sold out. I highly recommend this for anyone looking for some fun. Even the adults were entertained and trying it out."
5,the best book of meeting,"Not only introduced a win/win mode meeting, It also give many details to tell us how to manage the skill and where the traps lied.In a word, it's the best of this type I ever read."
5,5 star game and 6 star fun.,"THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!!I love it soooooooooooo much,if you need to know where different items are to make the ultima weapon,type it on google search and you will find the right one soon,I beat Sepheroth and got the ultima weapon and this game is fun,it never got old to me.The boss' were challenging and fun,the graphics were good,man,even the storyline was terrific.I played this game for months to try and get the ultima weapon and beat Sepheroth and once I hit level 90 I beat him.The keyblade that you get(fenrir) is greater at strength than any other keyblade,but enough about what I've done,they added more worlds more levels,more keyblades,more allies and more key characters.I sum it up in this statement ""I LOVE THIS GAME"""
5,exactly as it says,"Key Holders look and perform just as advertised. I understand the comments that the holder can be wobbly if not mounted correctly but just make sure the screws provided are level and biting into strong drywall or studs. Screw them almost all the way in leaving just enough of the head exposed to fit the metal bracing behind the holder. They look good, serve a valuable function and were relatively cheap. Shipped fast too very happy"
1,Terrible Product,"The paper is cheap and when you print off the images they look cheap.The perforations hardly even work.They don't even provide a downloadable file with the proper template. In the instructions, you are told to print a copy on white paper and then HOLD IT NEXT to the avery paper to see if it will copy correctly. I could hardly believe it.Total waste of money."
5,RUBEN IS THE BOMB!!!!,THIS ALBUM IS TRUELY ONE OF THE BEST THIS YEAR AND THERE IS ALOT TO CHOOSE FROM. FROM START TO FINISH THIS CD IS GOOD. A VERY GOOD MIX OF R&B WITH A LITTLE HIP HOP. VERY TASTEFUL CD. IT DOES NOT COME OUT OF MY CD PLAYER. PLEASE SUPPORT HIM AND BUY THIS CD. AND DON'T PAY ANY ATTENTION TO THE HATERS. FROM THE PROMATION WE ALL KNOW RUBEN IS GETTING DISSED AND ALL THE ATTENTION TO CLAY WHICH IS NOT RIGHT. IT JUST PROVES THAT THIS WORLD IS VERY RACIST. WHY DOES CLAY GET ALL THE ATTENTION ON EVERY TV SHOW AND WIN ALL THE AWARDS. HIS ALBUM SHOULD NOT HAVE CAME OUT BEFORE RUBENS ANYWAY. BUT WE ALL KNOW HOW THAT WENT N-E WAY PLEASE GO GET THE WONDERFUL ALBUM YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED.
1,Huge Dissapointment!,"I was expecting all cities to be shown...not just the few that they did. Where was Boston, Toronto, etc... Then they split DC and NYC! Just awful. The graphics covered too much of the screen of what they did show, and we could live without the CNN logo in the corner! Hope somebody else does it right!"
4,Rowenta DG 5030 steam generator iron,"After using a regular Rowenta iron for some time with good results, we decided to upgrade to a Rowenta DG5030 steam generator iron. We made this decision after hearing of the time savings when ironing with a steam generator iron. We read other reviews of less costly steam generators, costing under $100 and their poor performance. This product is slightly more expensive. After a few weeks of using the Rowenta DG5030 steam generator iron it has lived up to our expectations as a quality product. It takes about 5-10 minutes to build up enough steam pressure, and when ready we are able to iron more clothes, more neatly, in less time than our conventional iron. We recommend this product without reservations."
2,not happy,controller was broken returned and ordered another but the same problem The fire button on the back would get stuck and not work.Would rather get a xbox 360 controller.
3,"Strange mold, but cheap.","This mold was supposed to be used to make chocolate truffles, but it seemed only fit to make peppermint paddies. If you want flat discs of chocolate that are like a silver-dollar-pancake, this is for you."
5,Great little nuts for hobbies,These are great little nuts for hobbies - they are near impossible to find in stores and much cheaper than metal ones. They also are much lighter for use with lightweight RC aircraft.
3,Over priced,"I just bought this game new for [...] how can they sell it for more than that. It still needs some work, the only ships you can work with are the O.H. Perry's. No CVN's, DDG's or CG's. So be careful, the game play is the same as Janed Fleet Command though, it take some real time playing to accomplish your goals."
3,Why not provide replacements that don't need replacing?,"They fit. They go in easy. They come back out easy. We had 3 removed the first day. I have read some, and the color is indeed wrong. Yellow attracts bees. Red attracts hummingbirds. We finally had to buy these to replace missing ones because swarms of bees had moved in. The bees stayed and tried to get them off. We used some non-toxic glue that appears to be holding, though the bees seem to win over the hummingbirds.In summary, they need to be RED and they need to be UNREMOVABLE."
3,not very easy to use,"I found it annoying having to waste ten minutes walking to the opposite end of the area to find a deer. Deerhunter allows you to just click and drag yourself to wherever. Also, the maps do not show the location of the bridges so, if you shoot an animal and it runs across the river(which the hunter cannot) you have to potentially go all the way across the game to find the bridge, cross it, go all the way back, and bag your claim,while the other animals have conveniently made their way to the opposite side again...."
2,I haven't gotten a chance to use it!!,"The thermometer came with the line of mercury separated from the main line of mercury at both the high and low ends of the thermometer. We tried all the things recommended in the instructions to fix the problem, and nothing has worked. I have tried calling and emailing the company to get help, and get no response. I am very frustrated with the product as it was to be a Christmas present for my 85 year-old father. Am looking into returning it to you and getting another one as replacement."
4,More shrugs per $,"Good action, good characters, well presented. Wish I had a dollar for every time the author used the word shrug or a form of it. I know this is a series, what is the author' s enamorement with that word. Really the only detractor from the book."
4,Pride and Prejudice (with a twist),"""Lions and Liquorice"" is basically a modern adaptation of Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"" with a few curve balls thrown in along the way. It is a must read for any ""Pride and Prejudice"" fanatics or someone who must know the gist of the original story, but can't quite get it."
1,Utterly Worthless!!!,"This book has No English Listing of the French idioms contained in this book! Thus you can't find any idiom whatsoever that you don't know about already! And if you know it, you don't need this book. In no doubt unidiomatic French, ce livre est tres mal! Don't waste your money."
2,Smelly Diaper Pail,"I first bought this item because I liked that you could use regular garbage bags. I loved this product until I started my child on solids, then it was useless. It always smelled and I couldn't keep it in my babies room. I went and bought the new improved diaper genie, and I don't smell a thing."
4,American Scream,"Having loved Bill Hicks for some time I decided to read this book and was not disappointed. There is a depth to Bill's life that you see from the topics of his comedy but that gets lost in his more controversial jokes. This book shows you the other side to Bill and you realise his humour comes from an intelligent(which we already knew), almost spiritual place. It is fascinating to see how he developed his comedy and how he experimented and grew in his life. A great read about a great man. I wish he was here to comment on America and the world now!Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
3,Works fine.,I'm certainly not an expert on these utensils. I purchased a number of these in different sizes. Was smaller than it appears in photos. Very light weight. Seems to hold up in dishwasher. Overall not overly impressed though it gets the job done. Might purchase again.
3,Fun and smooth CD,"I do love this cd. I would give it more stars if it had more orginal meldies or broke some new ground. Instead it's more like simon and Garfunkel meets Beck on the approximated rap vocal side, which is not necessarily a bad thing. It's not brilliant, but it's nice enough. Jack takes you on a journey and tells a great story, with great hooks. If you like G-love, which i really don't, you will love this cd. Johnson is less concerd with how you much you like him and just how great he is then G-love (The best track G-love has Jack John's wrote). Instead Johnson speaks of love, isolation and times remembered. His words flow and beg you to sing along.Stand out tracks: Inaudible Melodies, Posters, Flake, Mudfootball and F-Stop Blues."
3,pretty good,"The book gives you a lot of good ideas but they don't seem to be anything different than what the BHG website offers. My opinion, check with the website first before buying the book. If you don't find it in the website than I recommend it."
2,"the real ""who sell out album""","Believe your ears people. This is NOT revolutionary, in fact its quite boring. With the exception of about five songs, this entire recording is worthless. The Who dropped their trashy, punk sound and cleaned up their image, and, hence, increased their popularity. I, personally, hate Tommy and everything after. For a tollorabe concept album, I'd stick with the Kink's ""Village Green..."" or ""Arthur."""
4,UN-EXPLORED TERRITORY,Phew.. I doubt if I will ever find all the functions on this fine instrument.. it seems to take and play everything I can throw at it... and very nicely... nice style and design.. slim... kinda matches the dvr cable box.. only point of confusion.. the rear panel is sooooo thin there is not room for labeling the connectors.. and the COAX dig audio out ... well you figgure it out.. less than intuitive.. I would give this 5 stars but have not explored all the functions YET>..In my dream world I would like to see... all DVD players this thin and the same size as all the DVD & Cable boxes so they would stack nicely.. and spacer feet for the top and bottom to allow for air flow...
2,Ugly,"Outdated 2MB junk pile. Very Ugly. Anylize this: A pink, gold, red, blue, leapard pal is UGLY. A faceplate that covers half the palm means it's HALF colored, HALF black and ALL ugly"
5,The Basketball Coaches Bible,A gift for my son who is a high school basketball coach. He has found the book very helpful. Good choice.
4,Solid work shoes,I have been wearing this style for years at work where I am always on my feet. I was unable to find them at the Easy Spirit outlet but got them here no problem
5,Hedges,Started reading and not finished yet but Really Good. Keep up the great workThanks Jerry Jenkins. A Friend from Pa
1,Why can't you rate something 0 stars?,"This book not only deserves 0 stars...IT DESERVES NEGATIVE INFINITY STARS! This book is the absolute worst book I have ever read! (Just for your reference... there is NO love and NO high adventure in this book!) It only has stupid interuptions from the author. There is only one good thing about this book: the characters are so unrealistic that they are funny. Many times, I found myself laughing becuase of the stupidity of it all. Read this book if you want a laugh. Otherwise... Please, please, please, for the sake of the sanity of the world DON'T READ THIS BOOK! I guarantee that you WILL regret it. (Another thing just for your reference... this book has no plot)Do yourself a favor...DON'T READ THIS BOOK!"
2,something better,"If you liked this book, have I got a deal for you. Please, please get a copy of C.Terry Warner's: Bonds That Make Us Free and savor every word. The Holy Man might get you started but Terry Warner gives the instructional manual. Prepare to be changed forever."
3,mediocre at best,"An appalling exhibition of blatant mediocrity, this chaotic clutter of bombastic solipsism would best be left where it is found."
5,nice,"I have been using this saw for about 3 months now. I have found it a pleasure to use. The vibration is truly minimal, no numbness in hands after using. Nice straight, easy to guide cutting. Minimal splintering on cutedges using finer blades. I have never had the orbital control off the first 2 settings and these have been plenty for up to 1 inch hardwoods. On 2x4 pine it is also a joy to use. much easier to use than my old B&D. Actually I would say that in ease and smoothness there is no comparison. The blade change system is excellent. No tools required to change the blade, no screws getting gummed up with sap from the wood. A minor point, but the carrying case is also nicely laid-out. The dividers hold the saw securely when transported and the positioning inside makes the case well balanced when the tool is in it. I think this is one tool that you do get what you pay for."
2,Not What I Expected,I bought this book because I was under the impression that Ms. Langemeier would work with ordinary people like myself - and change their lives. She took subjects that already had a base - 401ks and properties and showed them how to use them to build wealth. I have none of these and was disappointed that there was no spring board for me to use.
1,Trash,"I dont understand the great ratings. This product is like a fake proactiv, and proactiv is garbage. The cream dried and damaged my skin. The pills dont do anything, but I already take a high end multivitamin. Overall, I just dont get how it has so many positive reviews. I started using Oxy wash and that has some very favorable results."
2,Great if you want your toddler to bust his face!,"As everyone else has said, don't waste your money OR the valuable space in your home. Not only is this toy of very little value for an infant, it's downright dangerous for a child learning to walk. More than once, I just barely saved my son from busting his precious little teeth out as this thing began tipping over while he tried to walk with it. (...)"
3,Not the best,"This book reminded me of a cross between two of my favorite novels-The Princess Diaries and Speak. Like the Princess Diaries, Sloppy Firsts is written like a diary. Like Speak, Jessica Darling is NOT having a happy life. However, The Princess Diaries and Speak are muche better books. Everyone in this book has parts when I couldn't stand them. And Jessica has bad thoughts about everything. This book wasn't very funny, but I couldn't stop reading, and I had to know what was going to happen. However, this book is really deppressing, and there are better books out there."
3,"""Town & Country"" Not Out to Pasture","While this movie isn't as bad as its reviews, it was lacking in some areas. The characterization was pretty good...but the storyline dragged on and didn't really seem to be going anywhere. And I'm not sure it actually did. On the positive side, Goldie Hawn was wonderful as usual and more attention should have been paid to her as a comedy great. Although a weird subplot, I thought Andie McDowell and her family to be a rare treat. Although it was her psychotic father played by Charlton Heston that was given more screen time, her mother--suffering from a rampant wheelchair and the mouth of a sailor--was the standout and should have been used more for comedic purposes. She was the highlight of the movie!"
5,Puerto Rico does it better!!!!Ricky Martin Rules!!!,AWESOME!! This CD rocked! Invigorating and meaningful. Ricky Martin's first english album is truly fantastic.Ricky does it again! Again he puts together a complete CD.Very uplifting!! One of this years must haves and one of this decade best!Ricky Martin deserves the success he's getting. Ricky=A real Puerto Rican! YES!

3,"Title should be ""Guide to Outfitters""","This book is really about outfitters. If you want to plan your own trip, don't bother with this book. It doesn't help you plan your own trip."
4,Great Music,This is a great Nightwish cd. I like all the songs on it. You can't go wrong buying this if you like there other stuff. I can't stop listening to it. Tarja's voice absolutely mesmerizes me.
4,Quite A Romp,"BARFLY is what first brought Buk into my life, so this thinly veiled fictional account of its making was a joy to read. It's a bit goofy in spots (some of the names Buk came up with to represent the real stars he encountered are ridiculous), but classic Buk nonetheless. Why isn't Buk taught in college English classes yet?"
1,Whats with the price?,"Giving this a 1 just because the price makes this a terrible value. I got the regular dvd of this for $10, is the extra resolution worth this much more?"
5,The Stones at Their Best,"I've never been a big Stones fan but this album is great music. There are mixes of country, jazz, blues, soul and rock in this album which makes it one of my favorites albums of all time. A must have for the music lover."
4,balanced and broad,"I enjoyed this book because of the wide view of Islamic women it portrayed. From reports of the Taliban and books like ""Princess Sultana's Daughters"", we hear of very restrictive regimes where women are oppressed. Geraldine Brooks shows us that many women choose the veil, and that there are many different kinds of Islam.I also enjoyed the chapters on women in Islamic texts, and where the traditions evolved from."
4,Really a 4++!,"Rick Steves does it again. Great recommendations. The only quibble (why not a 5) is that Rick is so selective that he does not include places, such as Tomar, that may be off the beaten path but really do deserve a mention, if not a strong encouragement to visit. If you buy this book, or even if you don't, look at his website where there are updates and a ""chat room"" that help you plan a visit."
4,Very cute,"These are really cute. VERY THIN. so not for cold weather. and they run big. My toddler has grown out of even 18 month clothes of some manufacturers and these are still big on him (18mos). So plan for not shrinking, and bigger than you think."
1,Too Low on the highest setting.,I hung this in my doorways. Even on the highest setting it is too close to the ground. My son is in the 3rd percentile for high so I'm not sure why this thing is so low. Beware if you have lower doorways. This won't work.
4,Decent,"This was decent. It got into the character some more, but the plot was fairly predictable. The graphics were pretty good and the acting was okay. Would recommend only if you had seen the first one and want to see the sequal."
1,"We want the full movie, not bits of it.","When I heard that a lots of parts were cut, I got very upset. I wish I could find the whole story. I saw the original in French and I just want to share it with my English friends.This is the best romantic movie I ever seen and if all the parts were included in this video, I would buy it in a heart beat.Please make the full version in English."
5,Buy a MiniDisc player now!,The Sony MZ-E25 Portable MiniDisc Player was the first and the best player available for its price. Music is just the start of minidiscs. Don't bother buying a DVD player. Movies and computer games and programs are the next applications to be utilized on minidiscs. These minidiscs are going to be the future of digital information. Their excellent skip protection and inability to be scratched is just a few of the reasons to purchase one. Buy one now to get a head start on the craze.
1,Ak Receiver Tri-Rail Weaver scope mount,This iteam was absolute junk. I own a romanian Ak and it did not fit at all.I dont know about you but its pretty crappy when you get instructions that you might have to modifiy the iteam you just purchased.I would not recommend this iteam very cheap and not worth the trouble.
4,"A great, fun book.",I really liked the book because of my relation to the character. I saws alot of me in the character.
1,"Great juicer, but frustrating to use...","This juicer has a great motor and it really extracts the maximum amount of juice from citrus. However, the body of the unit is too light and it constantly moves and turns while you are juicing, which is very frustrating. I have tried many ways to resolve the problem to no avail, so despite how good it is in terms of extracting juice, I chose to throw it out."
5,HP Photosmart M425 Camera,"Can't remember exactly when I bought this camera, but it has been years. It has never given me trouble. It's easy to use,and makes beautiful pix. My only problem now is figuring out which memory card to buy for it."
2,"Limitted vocabulary, too thick","Although quite small, but it is too thick, almost 2 inches. So it doesn't fit well or comfortably in pockets. Whereas the webster new world pocket spanish dictionary is larger, but it is thinner, and fit more comfortably in shirt or pant pocket.Power wise, there are more words in the webster pocket, than this one. Both were grossly insufficient for reading of newspaper or of most books. They would be fine for beginner student use, and adequate for occasional use, but they are frustrating to use if you are trying to read the paper or book.A cheap small electronic translator by Franklin is much more efficient and TOTALLY powerful for reading 99% of words in most books. They have ""five million"" words (which includes all conjugated forms of most verbs) - and is the ideal tool for reading all books. Unfortunately, Franklin does not make their Larousse versions, which will cover most slangs.If you need a pocket dictionary, don't pick this one."
2,The Pallisers - The Complete collection,I was very disappointed in the quality of the film.Colors very poor and film viewing was awful. Verypoorly filmed. I enjoyed the contents just not theviewing. For the price it was awful.
1,Cool looking-zero quality,"Nice looking, mine performed great, for about a month, then literally fell apart. It isn't of any higher quality than an average five dollar butane lighter. Grossly overpriced. It has the looks, but it lacks the quality. When a 99 cent Bic disposable outlasts your cool looking 35 dollar lighter, you'll realize, like me, beauty really is only skin deep."
1,poor design,"the keys are sticking and make a lot of noise while typing, that is very annoyingsome of the keys are sticking when depressed.....and its hard to pry them back outwould like a refund"
2,Too sweet,"I prefer the Walgreens comparable brand which are cheaper. These are sickening sweet. For most people, sweet is not an issue, and they are more palatable than pills."
2,Doesn't work with some Timex watches,I guess I should have read the description better. Does not work with the Timex Ironman Run Trainer. I thought all ANT+ watches worked with all ANT+ Sensors... aarrggg.Frustrating.Just make sure this works with your watch.
1,Worst camera ever,"I am so glad after seeing the other reviews to know that I'm not crazy- this camera really is awful! The inconsistent quality of photos is dreadful, with many underlit and blurry for no clear reason. I love my other Cannon and wish they would stay away from making such supposedly ""smart"" cameras."
2,"Happy at First, but not after 14 months","I love the design and stainless steel (no plastic taste). Enjoyed the coffee for awhile, but after a year we've been experiencing periodic short brew times producing nearly clear coffee. Seems that frequent cleaning, especially where the tube meets the bottom of percolator improves coffee perk. Pouring some coffee back through the top produces more flavor. It's a great piece of hardware, but the increasingly inconsistent perk leads me to give it a low rating. For daily use I'll go back to press coffee and use the farberware for parties."
5,Fun and Satisfying Chew Toy,"In my estimation, the Premier Squirrel Dude is the best designed treat filled toy. The plastic is strong enough to withstand strong and extensive chewing and the hole which has three little teeth (that can be trimmed if necessary) keeps all kinds of kibble treats from just falling out. With other toys like this I had to resort to expensive fillers or high fat substances (like peanut butter) to keep our Jack Russell from emptying the toy too quickly."
1,DO NOT BUY!!! THIS IS YOUR LAST WARNING!,"We received this cooler as a wedding gift from my father. Unfortunately, he didn't read the reviews before buying. It worked well for about a month. Then, it wouldn't hold it's temperature. Then a couple months later, we noticed a black oil like leak under the unit. It turns out it's the refrigerator oil. It's actually supposed to be clear. Black indicates a bad compressor. Not only is this a piece of crap, it will cost more than the unit cost brand new to have it shipped off and repaired....even while under the 1 year warranty. SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
5,My first Scroll Saw,"I am in the process of getting ready to retire. My plan is not to hibernate but to stay active, and keep my mind in good shape. I hit on the idea of a scroll saw last summer and have spent the months searching for the best one for me. I decided on the Delta 40-570 because of it's size and features. I am a machinist by trade, and enjoy working with high quality tools. This saw will provide me with the opportunity to fulfill my desires during my retirement. I enjoy working with wood and plan to build things for my house and grandkids."
3,It's a good annex to U-Boat by Eberhardt Rossler,"I confused this book with U Boat by Eberhardt Rossler.It lists all unterseebooten and their fates and has some well written technical information about the propulsion specifically the batteries and the equipment used. It also has some excellent photographs of the diesels.The book also lists the commanders and some of the targets.It does not have plans except for a few line drawings.Overall, the book is a keeper since it has information one won't get in concise detail."
2,Dead Lagoon -- Dead Book,"This is the first Dibdin/Zen book I've tried and I found it wanting. I didn't feel I got to know Zen like I got to know Brunetti in Donna Leon's supberb Venice books. Maybe he's just not as likeable as Brunetti. And I found the plot someone artificial. And, as another reviewer noted, Dibdin's Venice must be awfully small because Zen keeps running into people he knows. I guess, in a nutshell, the plot didn't reach out and grab me. All in all, a disappointment."
4,Blistering,"This is an interesting contrast to the Vienne DVD. I find Vienne more musical and organic. This one is flashier. Saxophonist loves the harmonics which makes for a pretty screechy tone throughout. Bireli's playing is solid throughout, though again in contrast to the other DVD, here he seems to be trying to impress with flash and technique rather than beauty and melody. Nice to see the archtop playing as well on this release. I know this review sounds kind of negative, but notice that I am only comparing Bireli to Bireli. It still is head and shoulders above most jazz dvd's.One thought I had at the conclusion was that the track in which Bireli plays Bass is among the best. I am amazed to see a guy play that well on his SECOND instrument."
5,Keep them coming!!,"I remember finding the first ""Looney Tunes Golden Collection"" a few years ago at a Sam's Club. I thought that I had hit the jackpot! I love the old stuff. Cartoons were so much better before everything on T.V. had to be toned down for this poor tele-tubby loving generation. Even though I'm only 30 years old and a lot of this stuff was from when my parents were kids, I remember getting up early on Saturday morning to watch these very ones. Now I have all five of these collections and eagerly wait each year for the next one to come out to regain some of my youthful cheer."
3,Disappointed,I bought the Epilady Lengend and I am not happy with it. It's fine if your hairs are long but if you are trying to get short hairs because you don't want to wait for the hairs to grow long this is not a good product.
2,The same old thing over again,"This is obviously what Verant had in mind when Everquest became a big success. Release expansion after expansion to keep current players interested (while still bringing in money by selling the expansion), and to reap in new players with the slogan ""Hey! We have three expansions! Buy Everquest, plus all three expansions!"". They are selling the expansion at almost full price of retail software ([$]? Come on now...), PLUS it almost guarantees that existing players will keep their accounts. The game will still become a big bore when the gameplay runs dry. Shame on you, Verant. I hope this isn't what happens to all future MMORPG's."
1,Not recommended....,"There are errors in this book.Not enough - indeed any - attention is paid to important parts of the CCNA exam, particularly router configuration, WAN configuration, NAT etc, which feature a heavily in the exam itself.It may be OK if you are doing INTRO (821), rather than ICND (811) or the CCNA itself (801), however the book does claim to be for all three.If you get it ""for free"" from Safari, it may be worth reading as a primer. Some ""real"" books however are recommended instead."
4,first time is the charm,"this is a good greatest hits cd , lots of hits which is the way it should be and plus some other song s which maybe could of been hits or just hits with the fans. theres were a couple songs I would of left off but over all this is very good and clean. he is without one of the best performers of our time and his songs and cds will be around for a long time and if you want to get started with just one cd than this would be the one to give you what joe jackson has to offer you get about 3 songs from all his cds .its a cd you can play anytime ,party ,dinner , or just in the car!! Im becoming a fan and you will to after you buy this cd."
4,Rosie O'Grady DVD,"Glad this movie finally came out in dvd. The dvd has the movie in good quality. Too bad this movie hasn't been colorized, cause it would be wonderful with color."
2,disappointed,"My cannon died the day before my daughters birthday so I ran out and tried a bunch of cameras in the morning and bought one. Although this camera is 6 mp, my 3.0 Cannon took much clearer pictures. I have had this camera for 9 months and I am sending it in for the second time for repair. First the power button stopped working, and then on Easter (something about holidays) all of the functions of the buttons switched. When I pushed delete, the menu came up. Even the mode selector wasn't working. It was reviewing the pictures in all three modes. I will say that sony support online is very helpful, but I need something more reliable. I am done with this camera."
5,AN ABSOLUTE MUST FOR PHANTOM PHANS!,"I love this book! I could not put this book down. I am a HUGE Phantom Phan and this story is so beautiful. If you are a Phantom Phan, or if you just love a good story, then you must buy this book immediately.I don't want to give anything away so just read it and enjoy."
4,Presto pressure cooker,works great it is a must if you do a lot of caning.We have canned about 100 quarts of beans and peppers and stuff.
5,Stunning debut!,"Don't be fooled into thinking this is your typical ""Western"" novel. It's that, sure, but so much more. Barger's lively writing fills the page with as much scope and depth as do the mountain ranges that litter the beautiful landscape of this stunning debut novel. Make it tops on your list for summer reading this year!"
5,History rewritten,"As you read this book, you might think that Kamal Salibi is a police detective rather than a historian. Employing his sharp analytical skills and his perfection of semitic languages, Salibi provides an interpretation of parts of the Old Testament that is by far, different from most of the versions that we've read or heard.This is the second book based on Salibi's hypothesis which has it that the events of the Old Testament did not happen in Palestine but rather took place in the slopes of Hijaz and Assir (in today's Saudi Arabia).His first book in which he unveiled his new theory is the Bible Came from Arabia, which appeared in the early 80s.Unlike what a reader might expect, the style of the book is attractive and contains a lot of Salibi's wit, which draws the non-historian reader away from boredom.The book is a classic. If you plan to buy it and read it, it would certainly be a good choice."
3,FYI,"The title should have been the first clue. This reference contains thousands of books that are already leveled by the companies who sell them in bundles of six. I was hoping that this resource would have more trade books written by authors whose intent is to engage and entertain children. As the levels increase, the number of trade books does too, but the majority of books are already leveled."
4,One of the best single novels from the Star Trek universe.,"Back in early 1980's when Pocket books started issuing Star Trek novels, (even before they numbered them), Black Fire stood out as one of the best. Based on the then new premise of Spock as a savior of the Enterprise and the Federation.Brilliantly written, Black Fire stands out still in my mind as an exceptional rendition of a Stra Trek story (even after reading several hundred Star Trek universe novels over the years)Buy it if you can find it."
5,It gave us chills!!!!!,"I selected Edward Tulane as a teacher read aloud for my third grade class. At first, the plot seemed a bit involved and disjointed for younger children. How could so many things happen to a defenseless china rabbit? It seemed that we would never get to the ""good part"". The kids did not react much as I read, which is highly unusual. After reading a few chapters, however, the kids began to beg for me to read another when our time ended each day. While the subject matter can be a bit brutal at times, we stopped to discuss any misunderstood themes, and, soon, the kids hung on every word! The initial plot twist of Edward becoming separated from his owner made us wonder if he would ever return to her again. Kate DiCamillo amazingly twists the plot in the last few pages of the book. Prepare to have cold chills and goosebumps! My class and I certainly did!"
2,Not working for me.,"After a week my hair started to turn red.Not black,not gray...red.This forced me into a haircut,now looking for something else."
2,Not An Authoritative Documentary,"In The Grip Of Evil is an interesting little snippet of American occultism, but hardly an authoritative documentary on exorcism in the United States. However, the DVD may lead the viewer to take a more in depth look at occultism. If that's the case, I recommend Michael Cueno's book American Exorcism: Expelling Demons In The Land Of Plenty."
1,a disGRACE,There is only one Rear Window and that is Hitchcock's 1954 version with Grace Kelly and the irreplacable Jimmy Stewart. Why remake a flawless classic? Reeve and Hannah aren't even in the same league as Kelly & Stewart.Senseless in my opinion.
5,Soundtrack for Firelight,"Firelight is one of my all-time favorites.I am very excited that it is now on dvd, but I wonder if there are any special features. I got the cd of the soundtrack for my birthday two years ago- The composer is Christopher Gunning. It took some internet investigating in order to find it, but it is well worth it. The music is haunting and poignant. It is nice to see some others appreciate this wonderful film and its beautiful music."
4,Does what it is supposed to,Scale does what it is supposed to. Scale seems to be built rather cheaply. I still would recommend it.
4,should be shown in classrooms,"This is the only documentary I have ever seen on the historic Brown vs. education decision. As an educator, I think it should be shown in contemporary high school classrooms to help our students understand that it wasn't that long ago that racial prejudice was institutuionalized in this country, and what a struggle it was to even start to bring about change. This video is a little on the long side, but can be watched over several class periods. An excellent discussion started and educational tool for the high school classroom. Teachers of history, psychology, street law, and civics classes should seriously consider making this a part of their curiculum."
3,...,"I've allways been a fan of Jeff Lynne's musical stylisms and songwriting ever since The Move and ELO except for ELO's disco/pop derailment. This current recording has some good songs,good playing,nice vocal & guitar sounds. This is a generally good sounding CD but I can't understand how it fits into today's music market(this not a put down,just an observation). I give it 3 stars because the sonic quality of this recording is lacking. It sounds flat and choked. With a more open sounding, dynamic sound,I could give it a higher rating! But then, I'm only an old fan."
2,Ugh,"So it's not a bad book, but all the ""dialog"" that is tossed around and written as fact, combined with the drawings done by some five year old that are sprinkled throughout the book, combined with all the padding with cliche' ""pirate"" phrases makes me feel like I'm back in elementary school... The book may have also been edited by someone in elementary school. After they watched Pirates of the Carribean.It's fine. It's light. But if you're looking for any kind of scholarly or serious work on Blackbeard this is NOT that book."
1,stale daler,again the same old daler with same old tunes and same old dance sequences.even the extras dancing around him appear same. i will not recommend it to even the die-hard fans of daler.
5,This book deserves more than 5 stars!,"This book is so amazing I can hardly describe it! It will help any person who has trouble in math see things in a whole new light. Not only is it excellent for kids, it is a great help for adults as well. In the beginning of the book there is a fascinating test to see whether you are right- or left-brained. It is so interesting to see how you score. I recommend this book to people of all ages, whether they are good in math or not."
1,An Exercise In Tedium,"The title for this should've been ""And Soon The Beigeness.""The original ""And Soon The Darkness"" was an effective little ninety minute exercise in paranoia which benefited from a script from the godfathers of British TV fantasy, Brian Clemens and Terry Nation, decent performances and some spookily evocative direction.The remake fails on all levels.The director has not a wit of an idea of how to create tension; the two female leads are adepts of the histrionic Hollywood school of acting; Karl Urban (who is generally a decent actor) is given nothing to do, and the twists and turns are completely predictable.Worst of all, it's yet another excuse for the Yanks to engage in their racist paranoia about South Americans.It's not interesting enough to be good and not bad enough to be enjoyable.Avoid this one like the plague. I paid $1.50 to see it and ended up fast-forwarding through the last half hour. It made ninety minutes feel like a lifetime."
2,Um . . .,"I just wanted to say that I FEEL (many others don't), that ""I Want It That Way"" is an overrated song, and I think the songs on this CD sound very much the same, which is okay, I suppose. And, most importantly to me, BSB's music is SO DIFFERENT from *NSYNC's. Thank you, I needed to express that. :)"
3,RPF's review,"Starts well but rapidly gets rather difficult for a beginner. Second part re history gives good info' but much of vocabulary is of little use in everyday speech or reading,"
1,Horrible switch! Save your money and go with another brand.,"We purchased 15 of these switches. What they don't tell you is 3Com charges for updated firmware by requiring a pricey service contract. These switches also loose their config's very easily when adding/removing a switch from the stack and not everything is saved in their config when a power reset happens!! The stacking feature is a joke, it takes about 5-10 mins for the switch to begin normal operation after powering it up in a stack. They also have about 7 fans in the switch, which nearly all of the switches we originally bought had to be returned because of a fan eventually dying and the switch faulting.I was a huge fan of 3Com with their SuperStack II switches and those stacking features back in the day but these new ones are a complete joke and they must have skipped quality inspections since they downsized their company."
4,Just as I remembered...,Just as I remembered...great and corny 90's scary movie. Good flick without all of the gore from today's scary movies; plus there are a lot of familiar actors in it.
4,All Trekkies should read this,"Interesting although sometimes you lose it if you are not good in math.Of course it makes you look at the series in a different perspective, getting some fun out of it.But still it is a nice book even if it destroys some of the best science of the series"
1,Are there two releases of this?,"My disc has the engine noise LOUD! It is so loud and noticable that I cannot escape the notion that the people who gave this CD a favorable review did not have the same CD!And it's not just the engine noise, which at times is louder than the other content... there is absolutely room noise and other mechanical noise that means this is an ambient recording of the actual tracks! There is hiss... not tape hiss... BAD, CHEAP MIC hiss!I'm going to hook my DVD player up to my decent recording setup and make my own soundtrack. I'm not putting down Neil Young's work on this film. That was inspired and beautiful. The CD I have is just more bad recording noise than it is music.And yes, I have the full CD product, not a copy."
3,"""Maybe this wasn't such a damned good idea after all.""","A great film when it came out, Action Jackson has lost some of its punch since 1988, but it's still watchable. Vanity's performance wasn't that great and hasn't aged well, neither has some of the humor. The action sequences are still great and I still wish they had made a sequel."
3,Looks good... until it gets all scratched up!,"This case fits well on the N95 while giving you access to all of the phone's features, and looks good doing it. However, like other reviewers have said, the grade of plastic they use to manufacture this is poor.First, it scratches way too easily. The case looks great when it is new, but after a few weeks of use, the front has chicken scratches all over it which makes it hard to see in the sun. Second, it is too brittle. I have never dropped my phone and usually put the phone in my inside pocket or occasionally in pant pockets, but somehow it has manage to develop cracks on the corners.If they made this case with a better grade plastic that was more resistant to scratching and more durable, I would easily give it 5 stars."
4,Knightfall the Novel,"Knightfall is one of the most popular of the Batman DC comic story lines. It is a 3-part story, in which the reader is forced to deal with the traumatic possibility of no Batman! Also in graphic novel form, the novel of Knightfall is a thriller! A wonderful story embellishing Bruce Wayne's true character."
2,Misleading Title,"An interesting read, with lots of information about the huge oil, aluminum, banking, etc., companies. The title is very misleading, as I couldn't find any instances where Paul Mellon actually did anything wrong, personally. You'd think, based on the title, that Mr. Mellon was an evil puppetmaster, pulling strings and controlling the energy supply of the planet. In actuality, he and his family simply own huge portions of stock in many different companies, much like most fabulously wealthy families do. I don't blame Paul, or any of the Mellons, for anything they do or have done in the past, any more that I'd blame Bill Gates or Warren Buffett for enjoying their immense wealth. It's simply not anyone's business what someone does with their own money, but since this book was written in 1974, and there was certainly a hippie bias against ""the establishment"" in that era, I can't blame the author."
4,Good Megadeth starter,"This album is a good overview of Megadeth's work. I would recommend this album to anyone new to Megadeth, or who doesn't already have their other albums."
3,The Beauty and Horror of this Garden,"When I first started to read THE CEMENT GARDEN, I thought that it was slightly interesting but slow moving. The end of the book completely changed my opinion. Throughout the whole book I knew in the back of my mind that Julie and Jack did not share an ordinary brother/sister relationship but I did not know if McEwan would follow through on this premonition. This premonition did not prepare me for the ending.When I first read the last chapter of the book, Julie and Jack's incest disgusted me, but upon a second reading, I saw the beauty of the situation and I could not stop reading it.Not for the prudish or the faint of heart, but a good read all the same."
3,The New Harvard Dictionary of Music,This appears to be comprehensive but is written in detailed terms that one must lookup. It's like using a term to describe the same term. In fairness I am only a student but I rather doubt most students and intermediate level musicians will see much benefit from this volume.
3,Post-Freudian Giovanni,"The trouble with this bleakly modern staging of Don Giovanni isn't that it fails but that it works all too well. Instead of the Faustian Giovanni of traditional productions, whose defiance is so appealing that one almost wishes him a better fate, Gilles Cachemaille portrays a sex-crazed psychopath who unquestionably deserves the psychological hell he's created for himself. Instead of the stock commedia Donna Elvira, we get a hopeless co-dependent. The cocky survivor Leoporello, traditionally a double of Figaro but less lucky in his master, becomes a self-hating neurotic with just a hint of masochistic homoeroticism. Don Ottavio, traditionally a satiric role, in the Glyndebourne production becomes the most stable character, the ""therapist"" for Donna Anna. And so on. All the roles are well conceived in this dark, Bergmanesque psychodrama. It's a good piece of theater!Oh, but what about the music? Unfortunately, it's not well-suited to the action, and perhaps should be replaced."
3,50/50,"I bought the CD for the Song ""High School Nights"" by Dave Edmunds - very hard to come by. Other than that song, the first few songs are pretty good but the others are just plain cheesy which makes for a bizzare compilation. It's a very average comp. CD - plain and simple."
1,PSUEDOSCIENCE!,"Von Daniken's theories are pure psuedoscience that can only impress those who do not have a sufficient background in science. The ""evidence"" he presents does not hold up under critical inquiry."
1,Too Costly for This Type of Unit,"Similar units are now very inexpensive, but still not worth the price. It seems they are all made the same and have no life-span. I had purchased a Koolatron unit last year, and 3 other brands this year. Each of them lasted less than 1 month, but I thought the next one would be better - not so. The manufacturer needs to do a lot of work to make these little cooler/warmer units something more than throw-away items."
5,wonderful,we are very pleased with this item.it is sturdy and easy to hang. Only down side is they do not include hardware to hang it from ceiling so we had to purchase 2 planter hooks and some chain. you might not need chain if your beams are exactly over the brackets ours werent hense the extra chain. but we are happy with screen it was just an inconvenience to have to run out to the store and get stuff they could have included for the money we spent. pet peeve i guess
5,A proud granddaughter,"I am the author's great granddaughter. She wrote this book when I was twelve years old and I remember our entire family being very proud of her and thankful to have her memories to treasure in writing. I love to read and re-read this book and I take in something new each time as I place myself in her shoes and imagine what it would have been like to live out her adventures. While I am most certainly biased, I can honestly say that this book is a pleasant and enjoyable read. It contains romance, history, and adventure and paints many delightful pictures for the reader. If you are inspired by stories of people who worked hard for everything they had then you will enjoy this book. This book, perhaps, was my great grandmother's attempt at reliving life's journey for herself while inviting others to enjoy the journey with her. I know that I am grateful for the places she took me in her memoirs."
3,"""The World According To Lauryn""/ ""All About Lauryn""","Just to let everyone know, Lauren Hill reportly said that if she knew so many ""white people"" were going to listen to this album, she would have never made it.................................. OOOOOOOkay, Miss born again Christian, practice what u preach.It is a shame if this is true coz i would still like to listen to this album occasionally but at the same token, I don't want to support someone with a forked tongue.The reason i gave it 3 stars are:one star for lost onezone star for zionone star for can't keep my eyes off of uTHE REST OF YOUR ALBUM STANK GIRL!"
4,And the verdict is...,"Ok, so I just bought the special edition for this CD at over 20 bucks. Was it worth it? For me; yes. If you are debating on whether or not to buy it, this is the advice I have to offer: if you gave up on Radiohead after ""Ok Computer"", than it's not for you. As expected this album is very much a ""Kid B"" yet I don't think the album is as strong as ""Kid A"". While there are a lot of good mediocre tracks, it is lacking the big staples like ""National Anthem"", ""Optimistic"" and ""Idioteque"" that ""Kid A"" had to offer. The content is definately there...you just need the patience to appreciate it. Newbies to Radiohead following the trends need not apply."
4,A great way to get all those recommended servings in!,"I really love this book. I have long been a fan of oven-roasted vegetables and found this book to be filled with unique recipes utilizing roasted vegetables. I did find that most of the recipes are heavy handed with the oil or butter. I have tried about six recipes (I reduced the oil, butter or other fats) and found all of them to be delicious. I especially loved oven-roasted green beans and cabbage with dill seed.My children love roasted vegetables. In fact, my six year-old can't get enough roasted root vegetables.This is a great book for those who already roast vegetables and want more inspiration or those who want to try it and need a place to start."
3,"Some Awesome scenes, but still has inaccuracies","The battle of Guagamela was hard to see because of all the dust in the air, but the battle in the Punjab of India was nice-I've never seen a battle scene like it. Stone did a good job on the scenes with Alexander and his mother at the end, and when Alexander brings his troops home from India.innaccuracies: -The Persian troops at Guagamela were speaking Arabic-Rosario Dawson does NOT fit the description of the Bactrian (modern day Afghan) Princess Roxanne (look at the girls in Darius' Palace when Alexander enters Babylon)- Roxanne wore a burqa on her wedding day, with her face completely covered-this did not even exist nor was common in Bactria in the times of Alexander-The burning of Persepolis and the insult to Zorostrianism after Alexander's drunken fit was completely left out of the movie-Alexander didn't have blonde hair, why the whig?Despite the innaccurracies, its still a good movie about one of the best conquerors that ever lived."
4,Totally Funny,"This book made me laugh and laugh. It is short stories primarily about David's life/family. It is a million times better than his other book ""Holidays on Ice"". I highly recommend Dress Your Family but stay away from Holidays on Ice. It is aweful."
5,"It kicks ass, and It's the best CD I've ever listened to..",Orgy is the best band in the world and I can't wait for them to come out with a new CD or single. as soon as they do I'll be there. But I have their CD and single and am very proud to own them. I think heven is everyone listening to Orgy because they ROCK!!!!!!!!!
1,Caveat Emptor!,"I have tried to purchase this item twice from two separate vendors on Amazon. Both times the CD cover and the disc labels were as advertised, but both times it turned out to be a performance of Tannhauser, not Tristan. I don't know what is going on here but potential buyers should be aware that there are mislabeled CDs out there."
5,Steering Wheel Cover,"When I saw it on line, I thought it was perfect, but when I opened the box, and got to look at it in person, it was so much better! I love it!!"
5,"ELO ""TIME"" REMASTER IS TIMELESS!","This cd deserves a 10 star rating. The fidelity is absolutely breathtaking from start to finish. It always was a high quality recording but this remastered version is like hearing it for the very first time.If you are new to ELO's music and don't own any of their cd's start with this one. There isn't a bad tune here and the bonus tracks are just as great, especially ""When Time Stood Still"". Other standout tracks are ""The Way Life's Meant To Be"", ""21st Century Man"", ""Rain Is Falling"", ""Ticket To The Moon"", and the big hit ""Hold On Tight"". Jeff Lynne is one of the most overlooked guitarists in rock and roll history. Another bonus is the cd itself has the album cover artwork on it. I can't wait for the next batch of ELO remasters. Buy this cd, set your cd player on repeat and let it play over and over! ""Zoom"" is a classic too. Welcome back Jeff, don't make us wait another 15 years!"
4,MTB Excelent tips,"(From Chile)If you are looking to complement or improve your skills in All mountain - Enduro MTB riding, this book is THE BOOK!! It's cover all the situations that you may find in the tracks."
2,Up or Down?,"Really torn on the movie.I loved the beginning, but found myself wondering right away, ""Just how is this a kid's movie?"" The plot was just too grown-up. Then they started haphazardly throwing in this random stuff obviously meant to amuse young children. It was uncomfortable.Don't get me wrong. The introduction was engrossing. The animation was great. Most of the characters were genuinely lovable, especially the old man and Kevin. But in the end, it just felt like an ugly patchwork - bits and pieces were extraordinary, but ultimately, everything clashed.For the record, I have no problem with talking animals or nonsense in a children's movie - I even expect them. And I truly love Pixar. But this film just didn't sit right with me. The idea was very adult-minded, and it didn't seem like Disney quite worked out what message they wanted to send to kids. Very confusing.Although I really enjoyed some parts, Up left me feeling down.."
5,Great little budget Joe Walsh package of his ABC Dunhill stuff!!!,"While these budget packages are usually hit or miss,this one hit's the bullseye!!! Lots of great Joe Walsh tunes from his ABC Dunhill era are here,Rocky Mountain Way,Meadows,County Fair,Time Out,Days Gone By(with great flute and vocals by the very underated drummer Joe Vitale),Turn to Stone and more!!! Great sound too!!! It rocks!!! 10 great tracks in all!!! Had it on audio cassette and now got it on a awesome sounding CD!!! Two thumbs up!!! Way Up!!! A+"
4,You don't get very much of it.,"The hanging wire is fine and works well. At the time of my purchase, there was no description on the product page of how much wire you get. I'm happy with the product, but disappointed with how little of it you get. Since my purchase, a second photo was added indicating ""9 feet"" on the product packaging."
4,Good Toy,"It's a fun toy but not very well made, the voice box only works half the time and the head came off the first time we used it. But my nephew said there were no such things as flying chickens and we had to prove him wrong."
3,Great Singer - Not the Greatest Song Selection,"I agree with the reviewers here who do not like the song selection.Shel Silverstein's 'The Ballad of Lucy Jordan' is a standout here. Much of the rest is very middle-of-the road, but I'm giving it 3 stars for Bobby's singing which is still great."
3,Need Information about this series of books,I noticed the cover says book one is titled Carnivores of Light and Darkness : Book 2 is entitled In the Pale of Overthinking/Into the Thinking Kingdoms : so what is the title of the 3rd book in the series going to be and when will it be released? let me know at purplehaze_50@hotmail.com
3,Couldn't put it down,"Very enjoyable book. It's four stories. The first was a little too neatly wrapped up at the end. The second was deliciously evil. The third was kind of disconcerting. The fourth was sort of abrupt, too.But, all good. I'm a New Yorker and I don't live a life like this (but I have worked for womens magazines!). I'm glad I don't live a life like these women."
1,Ignore the hype,"Where do I begin? Firstly, this book reads like a promotional brochure for Princeton. Secondly, the brochure is poorly written. The characters are one-dimensional, the dialogue is stilted, the 'mystery' is non-existent, and the plot moves only marginally faster than a turtle in quicksand.It is fairly obvious from the outset that this is some sort of coming-of-age novel, however, phrases like ""Adulthood is a glaciar encroaching quietly on youth"" make me wonder if the authors themselves have yet to mature.Shame on the writer of the jacket blurb who compared The Rule of Four to The Name of the Rose. Comparing Caldwell/Thomason to Umberto Eco is akin to comparing Danielle Steele to Virginia Woolf.If you feel the need to read this book then go your library or borrow it from someone. It's not worth $40."
3,The softwares or drivers have some problems.,It stoped at 5% of the install process. I am annoyed about that.
4,Quite Different Book - My Son Loves It,"After reading the book, you are left pondering what exactly has happened. I don't believe Courtney ran away because the children loved him exactly as he was. The parents were terribly judgemental but happily accepted Courtney's favors. Perhaps the authors point of the whole story is to get you thinking - did Courtney, who arrived with a trunk that appeared to have travelled the world, run off to some exotic destination? Or, did the ""old, mongrel dog"" just pass on? My 4 year old son and I prefer to believe that because he was old, he went on to doggie heaven. And when the children were lost at sea, Courtney was sent down as an angel from God to save them. This version warms our heart. (We're not at all religious but I do like to believe in miracles from God.) Whatever the author intended, my son loves this book! =)"
3,Ok slip for sleeping,I was looking for something comfortable and easy for sleeping and lounging. I should have looked more closely at the material composition because this is a very shiny polyester. I guess I was expecting more of a cotton feel. Still it fits pretty well and was not expensive so I'll keep it. The waist is not fitted though as it appears to be in the photo. Its cut straight and the straps are not adjustable.
4,Farting in Uganda.,"I didnt want to watch this film because I feared having to see masses of visual atrocities like in Ruanda but there were just two and like any good horror film, they were the price of having sex. There were a lot of shootings though adding an American touch. I thought Whittiker looked rather Amrican and the many semi-nude dancers did too. Here the Brits were the bad guys similar to the Belgians in Hotel Ruwanda. Idi killed 300,000 of his countrymen in 1971 while 600,000 were slain in Ruwanda in 1994. Whittikers performance was marvelous, slipping as he did from jocularity to brutality in a flash. His appearance was perfect as well being a huge lumpy man. The doctor fellow was girlish and too incredibly stupid to be believed. He didnt deserve to be rescued and its impossible to believe he was ignorant of Idi's atrocities. He was Idi's Eva Braun so of course in order to move the story along, he had to have sex with one of Idi's wives just to prove he was not a homosexual."
1,for use on soft chees only,Only used this a few times before it broke when slicing some hard Italian cheese. Cannot recommend the product.
1,Piece of Crap,"I live in a town in KY that IS this movie, only difference folks is that it is meth not pot these days! Yes life really does exist like this or worse. So, I do not recommend this movie, it is depressing, degenerative, boring, and presented the people accurately with an average IQ of a cucumber. ""Pitiful"" says it all about the movie and my town. Also, It was advertised incorrectly(ie:no detective story)."
5,Best of it's type,Excellent book! Best of it's type. The operator's manual they didn't give you at your child's birth.
5,Sheer Pleasure,"I don't know how necessary the little puffy shirt doodad is...you could opt to just buy these two seasons separately for fewer bucks...but the viewing contained therein equals non-stop hilarity.Everybody on the planet by now knows what Seinfeld is and has seen all the eps in syndication, but still, I marvel at the pleasure these sets give. No matter how many times you've watched 'em they still hold up and they're still funny. The features too - the commentaries, the Notes About Nothing, etc. -are all well worth indulging in, too...All in all, a must have set."
4,A great bag!! Love the colors!,"I really like this bag! The color combo is so pretty, and the embroidery looks great! I am keeping a 1/4"" Hugger Mugger mat in it and an eye bag in the pocket. The fit is a bit tight, but everything's in there. A 1/8"" mat would be a perfect fit!"
5,Best Film Ever Made,"Never before - or since - have direction,screenplay,score andcasting converged so perfectly.My favorite scene : Janet Leigh stops car at pedestrian crossingas she is escaping with stolen money and is glared at by her bosscrossing the street(after telling him she would be home sick).Notice how other movies (Pulp Fiction) have used this."
3,Cute.,"As a special education teacher and a cat lover, I certainly agree that cats have autism. The book is cute and a little silly, but certainly nothing profound."
2,A Early And Lesser Norris Effort,"Good Guys Wear Black was the first major film starring Chuck Norris, who came to fame as Bruce Lee's deadly opponent in Return of The Dragon. Norris began his starring career in a ripoff of the CB radio crzae called Breaker, Breaker.But Good Guys Wear Black is his first major effort, and while it's not the worst he's made, it's not the best. This tale of an ex- Special Ops commander whose Vietnam unit members are being killed off is okay in places, and laughably bad in others. The dialogue in some spots is bad enough to make you pause and rewind just to make sure you heard it correctly. The highlight of the movie is the great stunt where Norris jumps through a windshield to get at a would-be assassin, but that alone is not worth the effort to see this film."
4,Intelligent and beautifully written,"This is my first Davies novel and I suspect I started with the wrong one in the series; however, MANTICORE was a fascinating read. In this, David Staunton comes to Zurich for psychoanalysis with a Jungian therapist after his father dies in a very strange accident. (Boy Staunton, his father, died in an auto accident with an egg sized stone of pink Canadian granite in his mouth) You think we're going to get a payoff on the mystery, which we eventually do, but we first have to go through Davey's life and get his personality integrated. The descriptions are very rich, which is a good thing because the book is mostly narrative. Despite sounding tiresome, the book for the most part is interesting and an enjoyable and challenging read. If you are a first time reader of Davies like me, I would suggest you start with the first book of this series, FIFTH BUSINESS before you read MANTICORE."
3,Nice book for the curious,"This book is more focused on what Tolkien might have been reading at the time and ""might"" have sparked the imagination for his stories on than anything else. He once said that he wanted to create a kind of modern mythology for his time. So this collection is a nice primer if you want to know about earlier stories we don't hear too much about today. Researching and finding all these in the library would be tedious. And it's nice if you are a writer or a fan who wants to know where many of our modern stories came from.If you are strictly a Lord of the Rings fan, though and want to know specifically where Tolkien pulled much of his inspiration from, including the ring myth, I would highly recommend ""Tolkien's Ring"" by David Day and Allan Lee. It is packed full of the ancient mythology, names, etc. he most likely used."
1,Product recall,"I never received this item as it was recalled by the manufacturer. Obviously, I can not submit a positive review."
4,LISTEN TO THE MUSIC...,"Panned by critics, 'American Life' was the wrong album at the wrong time. Over the years Madonna's message and heartfelt lyrics have been overshadowed by her image. The AL video, and war images overtook what is a pretty great album. American Life is another example of some great lyrical content which was overlooked by the general public. Ok, so it was a stretch for her to rap about driving her mini cooper while feeling super dooper, but I digress. Listen to ""Nothing Fails"", ""Xstatic Process"", or ""Mother and Father"". Deep, meaniningful, and thoughtful. Then there is the dancy ""Nobody Knows Me"" which has a great beat. Overall, not her best work, but still original Madonna. CHECK IT OUT...."
5,Surprised at how well it works,"I really didn't expect this product to work as well as it does. It really does pick up all the little stuff, and is very easy to clean. Even the roller is easy to clean when stray hair is tangled around it. Yes, I also experienced the problem with the pole coming loose at the bottom - I just inserted some folded heavy paper into the hole along with the pole; tightened it up easily. At the price, for me, that's not even an issue to complain about. I really love this sweet lil sweeper"
3,Exquisite Blend of all that is Mystifing,"Anne does a terrific job in tieing in her Vampire Chronicles with the Lives of the Mayfair Witches in this novel. My rating in no way reflects Annes Quality writing in this novel, because i am not a writer but a reader, and simply reflects my liking of it, for lake of a better word.Here readers will be reunited with Louis, Lestat, and even Claudia. Through Merrick and all her Worldly Powers Louis is given one last farewell with Claudia. And one of our favorite Mayfair Witches becomes a Blood Child. Filled with many ghosts, this read is fast, or at least better be if you read it at night!"
3,Sweatshirt review,"Product very good for the price. The shirt was not what I had expected, I probably should have purchased heavier fabric."
1,SUCKS,All 3 were defective!!!!! They replaced 1 in all said the other 2 and that 1 all went bad in 3 months!!!!!!!
5,Very functional.,"Works as advertised. Good craftsmanship. This allows portability of GPS unit to the floor to be 'out of sight' when leaving the car. This is important if you have a convertible, as thieves will steal it if they see it! This Friction Mount is stable and allows me to hide the Mount and the GPS when I leave the car. Good product. Good service! Recommended."
2,My review,"ok so this product is really tiny and you dont get much sound out of it compared the the normal sized ones. if i had known how small this thing was i would have bought a bigger one. the inside of the doumbek does not really look nice, looks like aspestos on your ceiling"
1,BAD PRODUCT,"This was supposed to be Liberace; however the DVD contains the BEVERLY HILLBILLIES, BURNS AND ALLEN, and OZZIE AND HARRIET.People obviously did their jobs when they inspected the DVD."
5,This Book Was Really Really GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,It was the first pike book i had read and i just could'nt put it down!!Infact i read it in less then a day!!
3,Maybe I overrated Hell Freezes Over,"I want to like their live performances, but they seem slow and country with some engagement of the audience...great tunes, but the shows?"
3,Zweibel's phraseology threw my back out,"My favorite bit of commentary is from the shlub named after a German onion.ALAN ZWEIBEL: ""It's like when I was doing Garry Shandling's first series, we wanted to have Shari Lewis and Lamb Chop on. I said, 'Of course we'll fly you out', and she said, 'Well, what about Lamb Chop?' What *about* Lamb Chop?!? She says that Lamb Chop gets a seat. I swear to God, I almost threw my back out giving her the benefit of the doubt that she wasn't insane. I laughed and she said, 'Lamb Chop doesn't sit in the back'. I said, 'If I'm not mistaken, are we talking about the same Lamb Chop? Because, you know, it's a sock! It's a sock with a button, okay?!?' And it ended up we didn't use her because it was too insane."""
4,Good clock radio with middling instructions,"My initial shipment was faulty, but Amazon immediately replaced it and facilitated returning it. The replacement works well. I like the large, bright numerals, easily seen in the dark. The radio is easy to tune and has a nice sound quality. The automated time setting is a nice feature that is to be expected in up to date clocks. The controls are easy to use once you learn them, but the instructions seemed a bit obtuse to me, and it took a while to get everything working satisfactorily.I would recommend the clock radio to a friend with the sole reservation give above."
5,I can't believe I am the first person to review this for you,"I use this tape at the start and end of my day regularly. On the days that I don't listen, my day just doesn't go as smoothly, and I don't fall asleep as easily. Louise Hay has a very reassuring voice and calm manner. I gave my first copy to my brother,(he is fighting cancer right now) so, I came here to replace it. This tape can be enjoyable and useful to anybody, no matter how deep their interest in meta-physics, new age, or meditation."
3,Not interesting,"This book that I'm reading is Tell me this isn't happening. This is a book that different kids from all over the world is telling there true stories about their embarrassing moments. I really don't like this book.Because it wasn't that funny or embarrassing.It is a short book and there was no point in this book.It wasn't even that funny.The funny one in this book is when Tasha's top canned off and eveyone saw her chest.Not unless you think falling in the toilet is funny other than that. You shouldn't read this book.Because it's a dum book, but if you like to read it than you should but I wouldn't if I were you."
3,OK Graphics - Terrible Immersion,"Gettting this product as a gift I was really looking forward to playing it after playing the Original Quake Games.This one is nothing like those. The graphics are OK at times, but the game never fully convinces you that you are playing anything but a game. It does not immerse you into the action like other games like Crysis and Call of Duty 4, both of which I recommend Highly!The Voice Overs are very annoying! and the sounds are very ""Tinny""! When you hop on one of the bikes, it sounds like a 1/2 horsepower moped! Nothing like an army vehicle should sound like.I'm not sure, but maybe I have outgrown this type of game now? It has been a bit on the ""kiddy"" side of things.Like I said above, if you are over 17, I would skip this one and get Call of Duty 4 or Crysis, both of which are far superior!"
5,Nice and Clean,"I have several Sandisks, and this brand (new to me) compares favorably. It is about 1/2 inch shorter, not that it matters that much. It is also a bit fatter, so if you have this thing in a USB slot and something else in a neighboring slot, it kind of smushes up against the other one, but they will both still fit. The lanyard it comes with is a woven steel cable in a clear plastic housing. Honestly, I have never seen the reason for putting a flash drive on a lanyard, so I suggest you use it for something else.Very good thing: this thing comes without nag screens, pre-installed software, U3 whatever. The memory is entirely clean and empty. For this reason alone, I think in the future all of the flash drives I buy will be this brand.PostscriptThis little thing safely went through the clothes washer in a pocket. I took off the cap and let it dry out for 2 days. Good as new."
5,Great for small spaces!,"We have a small home and the highchair just took up too much space. This helps if your space is limited! It is also GREAT to take with you to restaurants (as to not use their dirty highchairs), relatives and it's just great because the baby is actually sitting at the table with you. My 6 month old son just loves it and so do we!"
5,Nikon D80 CheatSheet,This easy to carry foldable sheet provides a quick refresher on how to use the many options available on the Nikon D 80
1,Brother GX-6750 Daisy Wheel Electronic Typewriter,"This machine is horrible. It was very frustrating to operate and it does not work properly. I'm not sure if it was damaged during shipping, because the seller said that it worked perfect before it was shipped. I could not get the ribbon in easily. When changing the letter wheel, the machine would make a loud grinding sound. I was able to reset it once, to make the grinding stop. I needed to adjust it again, and then it started the grinding sound and I couldn't get it to stop. I would definately not buy this product used!"
3,Works but not as wellfor all watches,"It does what it claims but the watch holder works best with adjustable length watch bands[leather buckel, velcro, ..]. My Rolex GMT kinda works if I use rolled up cadrboard to add lenght to the holder but is harder then to lock in to the turning mechanism. it is a very quiet machine."
2,Drag On rating,"Drag on's ""Opposite of H20"" did not live up to its expectations. The best songs on the cd are #6, #4, and #10. The skits are pointless and the rest of the cd just doesnt hav that spark. some well-known rappers appear on the album such a DMX LOX and eve. I would recommend this only to die hard Ruff ryder fans."
1,Don't buy this is you have an HP,"The description here on Amazon does not say that this is not for HP, Compaq, IBM, or Toshiba laptops. I bought this and figured out the hard way."
3,"Though it dragged in spots, this was a good book!","I enjoyed how Deanna and Patterson started out wary of one another then, little by little, they broke down the stero-types and began to appreciate each other and see how much the had in common. There romance built into this beautiful love. I could feel it grow for not just each other but also for Jade - who was adorable. The ending was kind of quick, throwing in the ""Nancy"" thing seemed a bit much and I don't understand why the writer made being a fireman sound as if it's scrapping the bottom of the barrel and something to be ashamed of but otherwise, it was a good book."
4,Great product,"I agree with a previous review that software can never take the place of an interactive class or spending time in a French speaking country, but this product comes as close as possible. I was amazed at how quickly I was able to ramp up on my vocabulary and comprehension. This is a great package especially if you are new to the language.The only negatives: First, I would rather it forced you to come up with the French words/phrases more. Too often it prompts with the French and asks for the English. Second, the dog in the game gets annoying reallly fast."
1,stay away from pvc poles,I bought this because it was free shipping with PRIME. We went to set it up for the first time and had the plastic poles split where they have the little push button connector. They aren't very sturdy. I will know the next time to buy steel poles.
1,Disappointed,"This is my 3rd Symantec product that I have purchased. The other two I was very happy with. This one wouldn't install on my computer. The software asked me to reinstall it twice. My computer locked up completely. The online help is only good if you can use your computer. My fourth time of deleting the software I wrote to Symantec and they are going to try to respond in four to five business days. Considering Norton's has always been good in the pass, at this point I would try a different product."
5,Works Great in Keeping Prying Eyes Off Your Screen!,"I have bought several of these privacy screens throughout the years and they work perfectly in keeping others sitting next to me from seeing what is on my screen. I travel extensively and work when I am flying. It is reassuring to know that the person next to me cannot see my screen or it blocks it enough that they cannot read what is on the screen very well. It is also very easy to remove, when you DO want someone to see what is on your screen."
5,Stirrings of a kindred soul,The corries open a window into the souls of the celtic people. Stirring my kindred spirit with their haunting songs. Bring to mind the fellowship of the ancient folk.
2,boys are worth it,"Boys are worth it. They do deserve just as much fuss and time as our girls. The interest has peaked on this topic and the author's aren't living up to their potential. Slow down authors. We will wait for sincere and more weighted guidelines for our sons. For parents who want to raise thinking, creative and caring children (especially boys) consider other worthy words from two other great books: ""Loneliness in Childhood and Adolescence,"" and ''MOMMY-CEO,'' (not at all what you're thinking but great in sharing the little but important stuff) and both are easy friendly reading."
5,Not your traditional E.T.,"I just rented this last night and it has everything a movie needs to be successful. It's exciting, touching,and thought provoking. It basically asks,""What would happen if the sweet little E.T. of 1982 had been bigger, captured, held prisoner for 20+ years abused and then gets lose?""As an audience we are first scared with the the abundance of confusion and at the end we are angry at the inhumane humans and then deeply touched by the simple love of family that finally is realized.This movie is great for all age levels but if there are family members younger than 8, Mom or Dad should be there as support because it's got some graphic scenes."
3,It's not working for me...,"I'm not sure how it works for the people who gave 5 stars, because I've been using it for a few months and I'm not seeing those immediate results I'm reading about. I'm not sure how rubbing alcohol will remove my harsh razor bumps, but I will keep trying and hopefully some improvement will turn out."
4,"no improvement over 3.1, but it works","Upgraded from Groove 3.1. No real improvement, in fact it seems a little more selective in timing of messages sent and syncing with other co-workers. But, other than that - the possibilities with new plugins sounds interesting."
2,TOO MUCH HYPE!,"you know,for the price amazon is advertising for this CDits really NOT worth it! i was like for this price he bettersing like D'ANGELO and the brother can really sing its justhis musical direction is all over the place and it throws offhis vocals like they dont match with the music,but i wasvery dissapointed i did like "" 4 u "" thats it!"
5,Very nice knives,"Not too heavy, not too light, these knives are elegant and sturdy - perfect for entertaining or every day use. Dishwasher-safe was a key selling point for me, and Gourmet Settings is true to their word. All their cutlery is awesome, and customer service (whom I contacted for replacement pieces) was excellent! Will not hesitate to purchase any Gourmet Settings product!"
1,Dont even bother,"I enjoyed the first few books in this series enough to see it through to the end. Don't even bother. The later books are so thoroughly dissapointing I wish I had never even started reading this series. You will feel completely let down as the heroes fail again and again and clones die by the millions, spending their lives for absolutely nothing in this unendingly cynical tale."
2,Not worth the price,I got this nail polish clearence wanted to try it out. I did my nails with Relvon nail polish and this one at the same time i notice that the Relvon is just as good as OPI because they both last same amount of time. Actually you can get nail polish for two dollars at your local drugstore that works just as well as this. Paying $8 for nail polish is stupid.
4,Good Robot,I bought this for my sons birthday party and was fairly simple to put together. Product worked well and has lasted. Would recommend to others. Also purchased Toysmith 4M Tin Can Robot and Robot Duck.
3,Navigation,"Navigation to the verse you wants take at least seven steps. One would think there would be a way to simply enter the Book, Chapter and Verse but there isn't."
4,Textbook Clavell,"Gai-Jin takes us back to Japan after the thriller Shogun, but with a cherry on top. Clavell combines characters that descend from the two previous books in Japan of 1862. For fans of the Asian saga, Gai-Jin fits right in.Some complain of the latter half of the book and the ending without a major climax. I don't agree. It's just Clavell's style. There's really no need for a major happening in the final pages since the entire book is filled with climaxes."
3,501 verbs isnot very many,"I am glad I purchased this book, however it is lacking. Expansion rules are specified but not explained. Sentence use examples are given, but points are excluded from other words used in the sentence. Nouns (even the basic ones) formed from the verbs arenot provided along with other things mentioned by other reviewers. If this book was made complete it would be have to be physically larger and thicker than its already almost one thousand pages. But, if complete, it would be a must-buy."
4,Capsule Monsters Review,"This is a fun toy, it is entertainin and I cant wait to contue collecting but I think the shipping was incredibly too slow in getting here!"
1,"I hated ""The Beach""","Having been encouraged by all the hype to read ""The Beach"", I was really disappointed. The book read like the first draft of a manuscript that the author should have been told to take away and revise, edit and rewrite until he had a proper novel, but publishers these days don't seem to have the staff. In any case, why bother when it sells like hot cakes?If Alex Garland was seeking to employ the most self-absorbed narrator in all recent fiction, he succeeded, but the result is that the events of the plot come out of nowhere. Since the protagonist is so uninvolved and unaware of the motivations of those around him, it is impossible for the reader to engage with him or them. There is no development; things just happen, and the narrator is unaffected by them.All I can say is that the blank canvas of Leonardo DiCaprio is probably an apt choice to play the lead role in the film of the book."
2,"Great for treats but if your dog likes to chew, he will chew it up!!","I bought the ball to slow down my pound puppy's ravenous appetite. I love the ball for feeding as it does stop rolling with the indents in the ball and limits the amount dispersed, but it IS NOT CHEW PROOF. My yellow lab loves to knock it around and get the food out, but when the food doesn't come out, she chews at it and now it has much larger holes in it and the food comes out easily. I would like a ""More chew proof "" toy. It lasted about 2 weeks before she figured out to chew it apart and the food comes out. Would like a ball that lasts longer than this one."
1,Lost much with departure of original B.Siege bass&drummer,Earlier tracks showed genuine individualistic creative theme that was driven particularly by the brilliant percussion and independent bass lines. This CD; struggling to find his own position.
1,Terrible,"3-stars? Don't make me laugh. I've had this for about two weeks and four of the six balls are already finished. These balls are particularly soft, it's easy to tell when compared with my Joola 1-star balls. While my ONE STAR Joola balls have had one broken ball in about 5 months of playing, I've had four of these Halex three star ones break on me in less than two weeks! Maybe I just got a terrible batch, but judging by how soft these balls are(just apply a little pressure with your thumb, compared to say the Joola 1-star balls, and you'll feel how soft they are), I think they're just poorly made."
5,Great Seat! Safe Ride!,"I read many reviews and rating, and this is the seat I purchased. It's been great. I purchased it because of it's safely rating and all the extra padding. Comfort I thought ... and it seems to be, but I didn't think about the summer heat. My son often has a wet back and a ring where his head rests on hot summer days ... even with the air on in the car. I didn't use the boot cover and the canopy is a hassle. We removed it. The covering material washes well."
2,Lumbering and unappealing out of context,"These are stereo recordings from 1961 that were part of an unfinished B minor Mass. It's not much fun to hear such lumbering singing without the respite of solos in between. I am a great admirer of Klemperer's stereo B minor Mass, but this was a dreary experience that ended about halfway through."
5,Awesome,"This review is for both parts of the Bizzar albums funny,catchy and well worth the price of both. ICP at the peak of thier popularity which they acheived with almost no radio and/or mainstream music channel coverage. An empire built all on thier own. For those who rip on them they have accomplished more than almost all of you ever have and probally ever will. And they did it in clown makeup."
3,Definitely a find - not the best yet.,"Went into a music store today, which had a free sample of ""Everything I need"", which I listened to carefully for maybe half an hour. Sure - perhaps not enough time to make a real judgement, but enough to note a few things...I found that a couple of songs on the CD sounded a lot like something from an Alanis Morisette cassette (pardon the bad pun). Also, I found the way that each song started with maybe 10 to 30 seconds of music before the actual singing became a bit boring and repetitive. On the plus side, I'll be the first to admit that Melissa has a great voice and definite talent - keep trying, Mel, I might even like one of your albums someday..."
3,Portable Headphones,"The heaphone does seem to need to be charged frequently, even when it is not used much during the day. It is okay for what I need it for, but am not sure how someone needing it all day would do, as it is not of the greatest quality. Sorry, but I would not recommend this to anyone."
2,Two left feet will not stop you?!,"This video states on the back that no dance experience is required and two left feet will not stop you ... WELL, I don't have two left feet and have been successful with dance videos on my cardio days but not this one. The moves are too complex and not called effectively enough to enable you to maintain a cardiovascular workout and follow along. I found myself subtituting jumping jacks and jump rope moves to maintain my heart rate when the choreography got too difficult. I still recommend The Firm Cardio Dance Slimdown for an easier to follow more effective workout. Don't always believe what you read on the back of those DVD sleeves."
5,Pleasing slice from the music cornucopia of the film!,"Yep, this movie just makes you want to go home and organize your own music selection. This soundtrack is great because it gets you some diverse music you might not already own, and you can listen to the whole thing and get a vibe from the movie. I love it!"
2,"Boring, repetative.","I got the game to try it out and I was disappointed. It was basically throw the knife at the bad guy over and over again for like 9 levels. I really wouldn't play it again, ever."
4,An essential trainer,Lisa Densmore's book has proven to be a especially good buy as it illuminates the core of modern high performance skiing. A close reading yielded real benefits. The advice on preparation for a season's activity has also proven most beneficial. The clarity and authority of the writing invites reading this well presented book time and again.
3,Half-And-Half,"half these remixes aren't too impressive, half are alright. The Think remix, however, is very poorly done, with many times the vocals not matching the music in feel at all."
2,Substandard at Best,"Far and away the weakest Pretenders album. Most of the songs come across as little more than Chrissie Hynde with a bunch of studio musicians and while a few songs such as the glorious ""Sense of Purpose"" manage to shine through the otherwise mundane proceedings there is a good reason why this remains the sole Pretenders album out of print."
4,Stuffed Animal Dog Musical,"This is an upgraded version of a classical toy. It softly plays a sweet song. It is not that educational, but it is super-cuddly. A perfect toy and companion for your little one."
5,An Accidental Engagement,"Back cover reads:While she was sleeping...Claire Farley wakes in hospital to find her memory has deserted her. Yet the biggest shock is her discovery that she's wearing a diamond engagement ring! Claire's fiance is the wonderful Tye Kershaw--he's perfect husband material: caring, kind, not to mention handsome!She accidently got engagedBut when Claire's memory floods back there's one peice of the jigsaw that doesn't slot into place--she's never, ever laid eyes on Tye before. So why is she now living in his house, wearing his ring--and sharing his bed...?"
5,"Kevin is the ""GREATEST""","I HAVE LISTENED TO KEVIN SHARP EVER SINCE HE FIRST CAME OUT. I THINK HE IS ABSOLUTLEY THE GREATEST! HE SINGS FROM THE HEART,WITH EXPERIENCE. UNLIKE ALOT OF OTHER ARTIST. ""GOD BLESS YA KEV"" YOU DESERVE MILLIONS! KATHY KELLEY OREGON"
2,Boring...so boring,"I tried really hard to be interested in this book but i quit. I just can not do it. The main character is a bland judgemental person. The plot lines are old, Andrea is so busy she did not pay enough attention to her boyfriend and best friend...so what? She is not a very likeable character. Miranda Priestley, outrageous as she is, was entertaining to read (which is a reason I gave 2 starts instead of 1), Andrea needs to develop some personality. I heard they are going to make a movie out of this, and glenn close might play Miranda, that would be hilarious. So go to the library and borrow the book, it is not worth buying!"
2,Avoid,"The DI-524's setup is just plain lousy.The interface simply hasn't been tested! If you go through the ""Wizard"" you can set up a WEP key, but if you do it through the menu, you get a ""Key1 can not be empty"" error message no matter what you put in the key field(s).Another part of the lousy interface immediately bites you if you try to set up a WEP key. Most wireless cards and routers have a way to set the WEP key from an ASCII string or Hex string or passphrase. Anyone with any sense will want to use a passphrase, so that's the one option the DI-524 does NOT offer. Very lame, very inconvenient, very poorly designed."
3,"Okay, but not great.","This book I thought was acceptable. At times, it was interesting, but overall it was just average.The story basically revolves around the Krik losing his command to Spock (temporarily) on the order of a well-respected Vulcan, who happens to believe that humans contaminate Vulcans. While in command, Spock is pretty emotional and seems to delight in knocking Kirk down a few pegs. Finally, the story reaches its climax when Spock, Kirk, McCoy and the other Vulcan are taken captive by very-powerful aliens who are basically using them as science experiments, much as animals are sometimes used for testing. In the end, they escape the aliens because Kirk is able to accept Spock as captain, then when they get back on the Enterprise, Kirk is given command again.I think that this story could have been told better, with less emphasis on Vulcan command procedures and Vulcan superiority. It was not very fast-paced or exciting, just a good way to spend a few hours in mindless entertainment."
2,Not polished enough for me,"Decent product but not polished enough so I get frustrated with it so I'm looking for a replacement. The timing and queuing are often off, some of the cardios emphasize the quads too much so you burn them out too quickly and the banter gets old fast. I would recommend skipping this one for a more professional product. However, I do like the flexibility of the format."
4,Northern Exposures,Interesting to see the behind the scenes aspect of the show. A good book for serious fans.
3,A bit too tight,"I bought these boots to replace my day to day brown boots. I had read on an online review here that unlike normal Charles David shoes, they did fit you if you ordered them in your normal size (my case, 7.5). WRONG!! I should have gotten them in an 8, the 7.5 barely fit me, they're a bit tight. I've been breaking them in, so that the leather will stretch a little, and I believe that in a month or so, I will be able to use them a whole day, however, right now, they cut my circulation, which is not cool. Aside from that, everything is great. They smell amazing (all leather), they're comfortable (except for the tightness) which is a lot to say, if you take into consideration that they are pretty high.Recommendation, buy them half a size LARGER than your normal shoe size. If you do that, you'll be in the clear."
1,Way over priced,I never heard of anyone selling a new or used walkthrough for more than $15.00. I think I will go to the bookstore and get a brand new one! What a rip off. Thank U.
2,Newer ones are lower quality,"Three pheasants ago, our golden's first pheasant lasted thee years. He broke the squeaker quickly but the rest of it held up through tug-o-pheasant AND his chewing years. The last three pheasants have lasted less than 6 months each. The current one is losing limbs and the squeaker still works - it's only 4 months old. AKC, what gives on the low quality now?? Double the price and use a REAL stitch on the seams, it's stupid to throw away so many bird parts!"
1,BAD,Worst directing and acting I've seen in a long time in a Hwood movie. The main actor shoud be doing industrial videos for the Navy instead.
1,Not his best,Oh my this book was so boring and slow compared with his other novels which I own and love. I kept expecting for a shift to peak my interest but it just never came along. Get this one from the library don't bother buying it you will be so sorry.
3,Just ok,"Thought this version of Namo has some user flaws. Highlighted scrolling is WAY to fast, and makes it impossible to copy anything by highlighting with a mouse if it is not already on the screen. Don't know if there are options to change it, if there is I haven't found it. Undo doesn't work after a copy of the HTML has been saved - very annoying. Still works for what I need though."
3,"Good overall, not very specific.","Good general information, but not very detailed on any one subject. Good read if you are interested in many areas of VB programming but don't want to buy ten different books. After reading one section, if you are still interested, then you know to buy the full book on that one subject."
5,Great toy for kids,"Bumble balls were originally made for kids, but for some reason they stopped and started making them for dogs. My son loves to chase the bumble ball all over the house. Great toy!"
1,the WORST movie ever,"I regret those 2 houres that i spend from my life, I watch it at theatre 6 monthes ago, and I couldnt wrote anything about it because remembering it makes me feels sick, it it disgusting, BORING, with no aim or clear line, you never know what this film wants to tell you, FULL of faults and unsequenced actions, unconvinsing at all, I hated myself that I spended those 120 minute in this poor, very poor work...."
4,Good movie...better is on the way!!!,"This was a good movie! The CGI folk looked very real and sometimes I too forgot it was animated! Anyhoo...a lot of people don't understand why this is named ""Final Fantasy!"" But, they're stupid! Because, the real question would be...Why is FF2 named ""FF2"" when it has nothing to do with FF1!"" OR any other number...like 4..5..6-10...none of them have anything to do with each other, so just think of this as another game...same name...different people and story...and quit whining! And...X-2 is a sequel (And, it is NOT named ""12"") so that one deserves a number! Anyhoo...your prayers have been answered! The best game (FF7) is having a sequel (a movie) out in July! I suggest everyone purchase the game(15$) for PSone(50$) and get to playing before July rolls around! Subtitle is ""Advent Children"" Will be several times better than this movie!"
3,Special Effects and then Nothing,Alright you have to admit. Great fight scenes. But beside that just plain weird. I know what u r saying see it again and u will understand but i have seen it three times and besides effects it is nuthin.
4,Historical thriller,"I liked ""Pillars of the Earth"". Though long, it was never boring - quite the opposite, in fact. I was disappointed that the work lacked the thematic depth suggested by the title. I was also frequently confused by the cathedral terminology. While I'm interested in the Middle Ages, I'm not an architectural scholar. ""Pillars"" is very interesting in its depiction of daily lives - usual or otherwise. Suggested for entertainment over enlightenment. Perhaps ""Pillars"" is part of a new genre - the historical thriller."
5,Another Must Read,"If you like Kundera, have a fondness for Nietzsche, enjoyed the Bill Murray movie ""Groundhog's Day,"" or sit there mulling over the towering pronouncement from Rilke's ""Archaic Torso of Apollo,"" : 'You must change your life!' then this is the book for you. Even if none of the above apply to you, just take a chance on this slim novel. While I wouldn't recommend the entire mystical theosophist movement that propelled Ouspensky, this work will never quite leave you -- my criterion for a work of great art."
2,'Best Of Heavy Metal' (BMG Special Product) Various Artists,"Only reason I'm giving this various artists ten track disc a two-star rating is because of the price. I mean sure, there are cool '80's metal classics here from the likes of UFO, Motorhead, Overkill, Saxon and W.A.S.P. But, UNLESS you're either totally 'new' to '80's metal, a poser or one of those lame-o music fans that CAN'T even name two actual song titles by one (or more) of your 'favorite' bands, then I suggest you purchase the proper CD reissue these tunes came off of. One type I cannot stand are music fans that are TOTAL music illiterate. Augh!"
5,david is the man,"This CD is intelligent and funny. David is too. It's worth buying, in my opinion. I am a 25 year old college senior in English Lit."
1,I should have listened,"I had read the mixed reviews of this product before I bought it. But the mat was better-looking than the others, so I hoped the naysayers were wrong. Unfortunately, they were right. The grippers do not have sufficient grip, even under perfect conditions. If even a little extra water gets under the mat, it wants to float. The cheap, ugly rubber mats you can buy in grocery stores do a better job."
3,For die-hard fans only...,"I give season 8 a 3-star rating, which is relative to other tv shows. Compared to Red Dwarf at its finest (seasons 1-5), I think it's barely a 2.By season 8 the show was only a pale shadow of its former self. I'm shocked at how un-funny it is. Also, the actors have noticeably aged...their characters are meant to be twenty-something not, middle-aged.Back in the early 90s, Chris Barrie said he hoped Red Dwarf would have a ""proper ending"", i.e., wouldn't go on unnecessarily. Sadly, that didn't come about due to the long gap between seasons 6 and 7 and the enormous popularity of the series. It's a real shame that season 8 is apparently the end of Red Dwarf, since the long-anticipated movie probably won't happen now (and I think the tv cast are too old for it now anyway). Red Dwarf RIP (1988-1999) :("
3,kits wlderness,"Kits wilderness is a fantasy book with a touch of magic and some adventure, David Almond who has also written books such as Skellig is the author of Kits Wilderness. The starts of with Kit moving to Stonygate after his grandma has died. He meets up with a boy called John Askew who has two sides to his personality. They play a game, a game called death. Kit and Askew have both got unique talents to explore. Kit encounters many problems as the novel takes many twist and turns. His granpa falls ill and Askw has a grudge against him. The past haunts Kit and goahsts from the past come back.Askew, espacially has a good charachter profile he is a caveman type figuer and has a different reaction to each character. This book would appeal to people of all ages and is well worth a read. I would give this book **** stars out of 5."
5,panasonic battery,well what to say...battery ordered was that delivered and it worked as advertised. Perfect experience.
3,IT WAS EDITED,"I ordered the video and received ""EDITED"" versions. I did not see anywhere in the description where it says edited or condensed. They aren't even the whole show. I was very disappointed."
1,"So much hatred, so little brains...","I wonder why some people in this country who claim to be such good Christians have no problem with our government slaughtering thousands of families? If the church of liberalism is godless, then what would you call a government who has done just that? Invaded another country for its own personal gain? I just can't help but wonder what makes Ann Coulter tick, that her vision is so clearly focused in one direction while totally ignoring the sins of her own. I am reminded of the Bible passage that talks about removing the log from one's own eye before attempting to remove the speck from a brothers. These kind of books will do nothing more than to continue to polorize this country, other than making her more money from idiots who cheer her on."
2,Track 1 is good....,"Love Don't Cost A Thing is the first song and the strongest song on the entire album. I find this album underproduced and way too poppy. Instead of going for her own sound, Jennifer decided to just go with the trend. I love ""Love Don't Cost A Thing"" but it is no near as strong as any of the singles off On the 6. On The 6 seemed better produced and better put together. The album seemed much more professional, and had better songs. The music sounds like much more effort was put into On the 6, then onto J. Lo. J Lo sounds like it was put together in 1 or 2 months...I think Jen should have spent more time working on it, and should have recorded better quality songs. I suggest that you buy the single of Love Don't Cost A Thing, and don't buy this album. Stick with the first one, and if you already own it, you'll be disapointed by this. I was expecting more."
4,Always The Duke,"I bought this DVD without expectations but wanted to add it to my John Wayne colection. To my surprise the movie was pretty good. The two young actors that played his boys did a good job as mischief makers and the story flowed as a good old western should. There were a couple of slow spots in the movie, but, that is what true story telling is about. If you like The Duke and you like the old fashioned westerns this film is not great but it is a descent film and worth a look."
1,Luck not in our favor either!,"We purchased this train (a month early) for our three yr. old, (loves trains). It olny worked for about 4 hrs. While it did work it was the hit, but now I can't take it back because he still sleeps with it and I can't find another one, they are all out of stock. So as luck would have it we are stuck with a broken train, I believe it had a short in it or something to that affect!"
4,Sweet Lorain!,"Michael Dirda is a cousin of mine, and I remember going to my local Borders to hear him speak about this book (and get a signed copy!) when it first came out. It was a treat to finally get around to reading the book and experience his perception of some of my relatives. Marlene and ""Cookie"" are my aunt and uncle and their sister is my grandmother, the third Kucirek cousin who is, unfortunately, not mentioned! I grew up in Lorain in the 90s, and it's amazing to me that not much has really changed. I can pinpoint nearly all the locations he discusses, and can vouch for myself that Yala's Pizza really is the best!! I consider myself more of a casual reader, so some of the ending chapters where he gives us more of his musings on authors and their works was a little dull for me. Overall, though, the book is a wonderful telling of life in Lorain."
3,Buy It Used,"Nights in Rodanthe was a good story, a quick read and it had some moving parts. But it just wasn't up to the level of Nicholas Sparks' earlier books. This seems to happen to a lot of authors who get very famous. I will still read and even look forward to his future books, but I won't be rushing out to buy them anymore. I feel a little let down like he's taking his readers for granted and putting stories out now using a formula. Come on, Nicholas, give us the good stuff again!"
4,The Giver review,"The novel &#65533;The Giver&#65533; is about a community without colour, war, love or pain. Everything is the same and under control by &#65533;The Elders&#65533;. There are no choices and everybody is assigned a role in the community. When Jonas becomes 12 he is going to receive special training from the Giver. The Giver translates Jonas all the memories and the pleasure of life. There is no turning back for Jonas. As he discovers the secret of the community, he wants to go to Elsewhere. I suggest that book to readers who like to be left wondering and thinking, because if you read this book, that&#65533;s you will be doing by the end.*** www.....de.vu ***"
3,Snazzy but not great,"I was impressed by the fancy graphics and menu effects, and the novel user interface of Kai's Power Show. But I was very disappointed with the functionality in a number of areas:1. There is no built in Help, so one cannot search for the answer to a question, no FAQ list, no index. One must use trial and error to find out what the capabilities are and are not.2. The product advertises compatibility with MS PowerPoint, but I did not find out until after purchase that the newest version it is compatible with is PowerPoint 97, now over 7 years old!3. The product will not display the show full screen except on very low resolution monitors (640 x 480). Most displays and projectors are much higher resolution these days, and Power Show provides no way to up the resolution/size. It is a product that will not grow with your hardware.4. While it will play some video formats, it omits MPEG, probably the most popular of all, and also WMV."
2,disappointed,"I don't like the consistency of the product.I had a Bath & Body Works gardenia product beforethat was much richer and creamier than this butI couldn't find it any more.I wouldn't buy this product again, butI'll use it until it's gone."
1,third day is the most overrated christian band,"Come on guys. Step out of your artificial christian comfort zones, turn on the radio and listen to what real music sounds like. Southern country hick-rock died just after hootie's first album, but apparently Mac Powell didn't take notice.Only in CCM can bands like Third Day put out such crap and still be able to make thousands of dollars. What a joke of a music industry. We need to stop encouraging people from putting out music that belongs in a trailer park.Third Day's first album was okay because trailer trash rock was in back then. It ain't anymore, but they keep on insisting on making people listen to it through albums like Come Together. This album is horrible. I could not think of a worse way to spend $15."
5,Williams Sonoma Kids Baking,Great book for kids. My granddaughter loved it for Christmas 2009. Arrived just in time for Christmas and in great condition.
5,Why Havent you gotten this book yet?,"1)All of us are guilty of being in a trans-like state while watching the TV! I have been TV free for almost 2 years! Thanks to this book.I recommend this book before you read Neil Postman. this book gives wonderful examples of TV-minds, and how we are possesed and live our lives around a small (or big) black box that controls our minds! My advice, read this book, get more knowledge on the effects of TV in your life then THROW THE TV IN THE GARBAGE!"
5,A Must-Have for the Classic Country Lover,Wannabe Texan? This album is for you. Native Texans like me certainly appreciate the classic voices of Jennings and Nelson. Truly great country.
3,not great,I expected better from the Swingline family. This hole punch sticks and doesn't retract properly. I wasn't overloading the hole punch either. Perhaps I just got a bum model.
1,Very relieved to see that I am not alone!,"After reading about half of the book (I was stuck in an airport and had no choice), I finally did something I've never done. I put the book down with no intentions of ever picking it up again. I couldn't believe that this was the same writer of Mila 18 and Trinity! I, therefore, am greatly relieved to see that I am not alone in my opinion of this extraordinarily trite book. Thank you to all the other reviewers - I wish I'd read your reviews before buying this book!"
5,A better bleach,"Incesticide reminds me of Bleach. It has the same raw feel. The songs though, are much better and sound more experienced. The first half has the more radio-friendly songs(not that they are at all) and the second half has a lot of screaming. From Dive, you know that this is not going to be Nevermind. Its a good buy if you like Nirvana a lot and can tolerate a lot of screaming songs. If you like Bleach or In Utero, you will probably like it. If you've just heard Nevermind and liked it, you can't really predict it. It takes a little while to get into it. Give it a chance. Once you do, its hard to get sick of...probably the hardest."
5,Yeah!,"I realize that normally, when a review gets a perfect score from some random person, it's shouldn't be trusted. But this review is perfectly legitemate. This game is, in my opinion, one of the greatest games created, along with SM World and Halo: CE. For it's time, it has beautiful graphics. The controls are PERFECT, although the camera is rather pitiful. But once again, compared to other games in during it's time, gameplay is nearly perfect. Levels can be replayed several times to gather stars, and after that, you'll want to return to break a record or something. The music never lets down; it's filled with a whole bunch of great 'tunes', as the kids say today. So if you have an N64, a bunch of free time and don't already have this... you know what to do."
2,Good Layout - Shoddy Quality,"I got two of these as gift. One controller went bad, and then the other. The problem is that the 6 buttons on the right spring back up after pushing them down partially because they are attached to some medicore plastic chassis inside the controller. Anyone who pushes these buttons repeatedly(I do this for speed bursts and checks in EA NHL games) will ultimately break the button away from the plastic. As a result, the buttons will start to stick. To put it another way, you push down, but the button doesn't come back up. I took one apart and cleaned the buttons out a little, and seems to be functional again, but the responsiveness of the buttons is not what it used to be and it's only a matter of time before the buttons go bad again. And another thing, there's too much space between the buttons and the controller, and it allows grit to get into the controller and affects the buttons, too. I'm probably going to get a gravis next time."
2,Overrated,"This book is overrated. The writing style is verbose, the dialog limited, and the characters are undeveloped. All of the characters sound the same. There is no character development. The author needs to go back to school. Some of the sentences are very carefully crafted, even poetic but other than that the book is overrated. The book's greatest strength is that is based on a fascinating event. It's puzzling that a young author would attempt this topic. At times, I thought how could she have possibly have understood this movement without living through it? Her depiction of that time period is oversimplified and trivializes history. If you are bored and have extra time, the book is entertaining due to the Patty Hearst theme. Otherwise, I would save my money and time. The author is a frustrated poetic and not a novelist."
4,What a change - Jack just plays...,"No singing on this album. The entire album is filled with what Jack does best: wail on his trumpet. Excellent combo performances, from soulful ballads to jazzy uptempo tunes. Jack is at the top of his game on this album. Jerry Dodgion assists on alto, along with Barry Harris on piano, Rufus Reid on bass, and Ben Riley on drums. 13 tracks and over 63 minutes of super mainstream jazz. Play on, Mr. Sheldon!"
2,Was Robin Williams even there?,"This movie doesn't deserve award(s) status. I was channel surfing and joined the movie when Robin Williams was sitting in a restaurant booth with another actor, when I couldn't help but notice the too many back of the head shots during the scene... then it occurred to me... I don't think Robin Williams was even there for the shoot! And, he wins a best suppoting actor award? So, I started big time noticing the number of back of head shots and really bad editing to cover actors' ""awayness"" and clearly, this movie sucks. If you're interested in trying to poduce a movie, you should watch this one if you need a good, ""hell, i can do that"" kind of encouragement. And again, the # of awards? Was there no movies that year or something? This movie sucks."
3,the o.k.?,this thing is a 3 star item no more no less it is ok but does not have all the fraises that you would want just if the price was a little bit cheaper then it would become 4 or even 5 star but the extra freatures are always nice to have.
5,Policeman Small,"We give this book to all the Small family babies, they love it and we love giving it to them!"
4,"warm, comfy, but shrinks too much!","This thermal top is a good, comfortable material, and very warm as well. However, I would suggest that anyone buying this, either order one or even two sizes larger if possible - that's how much it shrank! After just one wash, the bottom hem of the shirt was at least 4 inches shorter than when it came, and the sleeves also shrank by a good 2-3 inches. Since this is a good product for the price, I might buy again, but I will definitely be ordering 2 sizes larger, so it can be worn and washed more than once."
4,Even if its fake it still wakes you up ?,It was like being in the 50 every one at my house was watching it.And i for one only belive in what I feel and have learned at 29 yr old belive in beliveing what is out there is not yet seen.
2,Not like the older kaleidoscopes!,"It's just O.K. Wouldn't purchase it again because the colors are not vivid enough--they are made out of (what else?) --plastic--not like the old kaleidoscopes which we used to play with for hours, which had metal pieces that moved around and gave much more vivid patterns."
2,a film to hate or to love,"I must admit that I had read those two very positive reviews (posted on Amazon.co.uk) before I decided to watch ""Buffering"". Full of enthusiasm I pressed the play button and?The plot is as simple as every teen comedy, so don't expect too much. In this case we have two gays, no cash, but a cam and LAN and a lot of energy to burn in bed. I spare you details.Jokes? Well, they circulate around one subject (sex) and aren't particularly elaborated.Acting - so so. I liked the girl. The owner of sex-shop seemed the most experienced of all.In my opinion it's one of those films, that viewers will fall in love with or loathe it.Judge for yourself."
3,Dark but good Story...,I did rate it 4 star then I changed it to 3. The reason being is that it is so dark. I had to change my tv settings to make the color vivid. Otherwise I like the book and enjoyed the movie even though the movie did all match up with the book. But what do you expect most movies are like that.
2,batteries,The batteries came in single packs which is OK. However they had a 2006 date on them so they probably will not last very long. Same store batteries have date like 2017 on them.Not real happy.Pay more and get fresh new batteries that have good shelf life.
3,Wrong size......,after speaking to cub cadet and mtd they told me order OEM-190-215-000...I did and it does NOT fit. My cub ltx 1054 has 22x9.50x12I rims. I can't seem to find weights anywhere for that size.
1,WARNING! Not an official Honeywell Enviracaire product!,"The description says it's a ""Honeywell Enviracaire 20500 True HEPA filter"" it is NOT, it is a generic filter.So glad Amazon has the ""A-to-z Guarantee Program""!"
2,Poorly constructed Netting,"The pond netting is not very strong. If you lay it on your pond, the sheer weight of the leaves and the ice will tear it down in fall and winter, It may be OK in the summer time preventing birds, deers going to the pond.It is a very light weight material good for protection of plants from the wild life.The merchant delivered the product as promised and refunded fully on receipt of my pond netting returned unused."
3,I liked most of it,"I was totally into this book at first. My dad gave it to me after he had read it and said, ""You'll love it, it's great."" After finishing it and replaying it's events in my mind, I found many actions and situations presented to be unbelievable. Furthermore the characters you know become less like the characters you know as you draw toward the end. Still, as I stated, I liked most of it. I would put this in book in the ""fun to read"" catagory. I wouldn't take it as seriously as The Silence of the Lambs."
5,incredible sound,"A magnificent collection from a improbable source. The sound is big, the ideas fresh and the performance extraordinary.No words suffice, just get it and let it take you up ""there""."
1,Overall I found this game slow and unproductive,"The use of the memory card feature in DINO CRISIS was found to be unreliable. Although the advanced AI is worth a look, more improvements on the things that count..like being able to confidently save your game is needed. The game will also lock up in unpredictable locations throughout the game. Capcom USA(c) went too far in advancement. Sony Playstation just could not keep up with the everchanging flow and mix in the FMV's. In the future maybe the makers of this game should take time making sure all features work before this game is put to market."
4,Concentrated lemon flavor,"The taste and smell of lemons overwhelms my smoothie when I mix it in, so I prefer to take a tablespoon of the oil by itself. It tastes much better than how I imagine cod liver oil by itself tastes. But it is very strong still of lemons."
4,Fog Juice,The fog juice was fine. It performed exactly as expected and lasts a longer time than I thought. One jug will definitely do you for a while.
3,"It is designed for kids, but","I think it is helpful. There are so many things to know to start cello, having someone demonstrate the basics is helpful."
5,Love the show!,Got the first few seasons free thanks to my prime membership. Like the show so much that I had to buy the next season. I cant wait for the new season to come out on streaming. Cons: Might be cheaper to find a box set and just watch via dvd.
1,Brown and black are bad in this book,"I don't want to sound politically correct or paranoid, but in this book brown is ""low, low down"" and black is ""mad and angry."" All other colors, with the exception of purple, are positive. My toddler, who is bi-racial, started referring to his own skin color as ""low, low down"" after one reading! It was our last."
5,"Yes, there is such a thing called ""love""","There are also gentleness, sweetness, innocence, forgiveness, grief, sadness, joy ... put all that together and you get one of the best movies ever (not only in science fiction) Jeff Bridges performed here the best role of his career. and John Carpenter created a true classic, highly recommended, I love it!"
3,"An okay story, but poor as a reference for Egypt","In school, we had to read this as a background for studying Egypt, and even though it was a better homework assignment than worksheets, I didn't learn anything. The first chapter spent more time on eyelashes than plot or characters, and the information on Egypt basically consisted of what these kids thought up, elaborating on real research. But the idea was interesting enough for me--a fourth grader--to collect a few Egyptian-looking items, set up my own Egypt Game, and get a few extra credit points. Basically, it's a great idea, with mediocre research, characters and writing."
3,"Today, Tomorrow , Forever","The remixing could have done a better job of letting Nancy's voice be the most important part of the music. The base is particularly dominant in several pieces and it sounds like Nancy is almost backup to the instruments. There is a flatness to the music, too. This may be all the mixer had to work with, but Nancy's voice is certainly not ""out front."" the 3 star rating is more for the mixing than her voice or the songs."
4,Blackberry Battery,The order was received in timely fashion. It worked and I'm happy with my purchase.
1,WORST tape that I have ever tried to use!,The review of this product sounded great so I thought that I would give it a try ... IT'S HORRIBLE! The tape keeps falling back on the roll so you spend half your time try to find where the tape was cut off and then trying to get it started again. I should have ordered Scotch brand.
2,Did not like,I guess I did not pay attention to the songs listed before ordering. I would not order this CD unless your familiar with the songs
3,Informative,I found this book to move slowly at times. I was very satisfied with the information given with regards to what Solomon does in the treatments. It was a learning experience.
4,Works pretty well,"If you're looking for a pill that is magical and burns off the pounds, this isn't it.If you looking for something that helps fill you up before a meal and likely lower your cholesterol, this is for you.Warning: The extreme amount of fiber in will cause looser bowel movements early on... Nothing that doesn't subside in a couple days."
4,Willie Clayton R&B CD review,"The CD is very good. Clayton's style could be classified as R&B, however it could fall into the Blues catagory by some blues fans. I am a hard core blues fan but others in my circle are not. His style of music is entertaining to both R&B and Hard Core Blues fans."
2,Not so great...,"The only story I finished in its entirety (and actually enjoyed) was the one written by Karen Marie Moning. She has not disappointed me yet! The others, however, successfully kept me bored!"
1,Where are they?,This might be good clamps but after waiting over 2 months I gave up on them. If they backorder these on you don't wait just go buy something else.
1,What a disappointment!,"Recieved two bad kits - both in Crane factory sealed packaging. The first kit was missing the ignition module. The second kit had a damaged ignition module that occured due to the lack of packing at crane. The heavy coil was placed directly on the face of the ignition module with nothing in place to protect it, breaking one of the switches during transit. Waited two additional weeks for a third unit which was never sent (and RidersNeeds didn't bother to return my phone calls regarding the order status) and cancelled the order. Words to the wise - Crane's packaging of this kit is completely inadequate - Buy the kit locally so you can inspect it for damage!"
5,This was loads of fun whan I was a kid,"I loved this book as a kid. It was a lot of fun to read and the experiments I tried were fun to implement. I even combined a couple of the experiments into a siphon powered water fountain that got me to the science fair finals.As another reviewer noted, the descriptions of the science behind the experiments is brief. A really deep understanding of the principals behind the experiments needs a little reading outside of the book, but it was intended as a teaching aid, not a textbook all by itself. I'm getting a copy to use with my son, largely because I learned so much and had so much fun with it when I was a kid."
3,Cursive,I much prefer teaching cursive from the beginning - but our school used this edition. I prefer the new edition.
3,Not the best,"This isn't the best CD player, but it does have a few controls that help skipping, etc, so it's not the worst. It DOES have Dora on it and that's why we got it, but as just a CD player I'd get something else."
5,Must buy this for baby and you!,"I purchased this CD when my son was born three years ago and we listened to it everyday for at least the first year of his life. I would play it during naptime and it is by far my favorite baby CD. It's soothing and sentimental. After searching my entire house for weeks trying to find our copy when baby #2 was born, I ordered another from Amazon since my search left me empty handed. My little girl is so relaxed listening to this compilation and since I already mentioned how sentimental this disc is to me, it brings me so much joy to listen to it with her. Even brings tears to my eyes. Who doesn't love holding a baby girl listening to John Stoddart sing ""Isn't she lovely?"" This album will not disappoint! Buy one for yourself and another copy for your best girlfriend!"
4,Good fun!,This movie is good fun and entertaining enough to appeal to kids and adults alike! Would recommend and watch again.
4,"Not super, but adequate","I've never really owned any coffeemaker before, but this one seems okay. If you just want to have a cup or two at work, this is a good deal for the $$. The filters are easy to find anywhere. It doesn't take up much space. The coffee tastes pretty good to me. Its a little cumbersome pouring the water into the reservoir because of the lip on the pot, but you don't necessarily need to use that because inside the reservoir it has lines for the number of cups that is easy to see. One thing is, if you don't use the coffee up in a certain amount of time, the element shuts off automatically and the coffee may go cold before you get to it. Other than that, I would recommend this, its a great color, makes pretty good coffee, no real problems."
3,Cannot network print,"I like the all in one design, but the software is abnxious compared to my previous lexmark. Not nearly as user friendly. And it CANNOT be set up to print wireless over a network. Big downfall for me."
4,Excellent Buy,"My 10-year old absolutely loved this gift at Christmas. Talk about imagination running wild... he and my 16 year old (yes, my 16-year old) who are football fanatics took this game and playtime to another level. It was equally exciting to see my 16-year old dive right into the imagination with the 10-year old. This is a great buy for any football fans with a huge imagination."
4,Stormy passionate tale of romance and betrayal,"I always enjoy reading Rosalyn West's novels. This one is no exception. It's a turbulent, sometimes painful, read. Throughtout the hours reading this, I cried, sniffled, cried some more, and felt so happy for those two people Deacon and Garnet when they receive their happy ending.I also wanted to knock some sense in Deacon's thick head more than once throughout the story, because it is thanks to his tight-lipped pride the story become sometimes just too painful for them - and me.Hey, why am I complaining? I love this book."
1,Would have gave it 0 if I could,"Leann Rimes is a hack! I've farted better music! And plus there are way to many I love America songs out there today. We get the idea!! I enjoy living in this country as much as anyone else but come on, an entire album of crap is how you repay this country! I say we deport her."
5,Awesome Rebounder,"I am 52 years old and have some joint problems. Also, I've always been a bit clumsy. :-) I've researched exercise equipment and decided that rebounding was the best way to go for me. I found the Urban Rebounder on Amazon.com. The stabilizing bar convinced me to purchase this product. For those who do not need a stabilizing bar, it is easily removed. DVD's came with the purchase and they are fun and easy to follow along with. I started with the beginner workout before I discovered the 'Senior' workout. The Senior workout uses the stabilizer bar, so I primarily am exercising to the Senior workout. I am 100% pleased with the Urban Rebouncer and would recommend it to anyone desiring to purchase an inexpensive way to exercise at home."
1,Hated It!,This is not a beginner dvd set. She moves way too fast. I should have gotten Pilates instead of this foolishness.
5,Getting Better!,South Park is one of the very few shows that just gets better and funnier every season
1,Belt Clip,The belt clip torn early on then it broke way from the case. I am very disappointed I like the case a lot.
4,Wii Controller,works great with the Wii Game system............looks and plays just like the one that came with the system.....
3,Not as Bad as some..,"...I have seen much, much worse. It is kind of a weak story but it has some erotic content. Be it a Prison and all. It was a fair movie and not bad to have around."
1,Failed after a few months,"We purchased this coffee maker after reading various comments -- it sounded like a good coffee maker. At first it worked fine, but now after only 6 months, it no longer functions. We generally make about 6 cups at a time. For the past month or so, it would only run through about half the water. If we restarted it, then it ran rest of the water. Now it doesn't work at all and we have to go through the hassle of seeing if it repairable. Very annoying. Other coffee makers have lasted us about 10 years or so on average. This is really disappointing!"
5,Great Item!,I bought these water colors to go along with a paint book that I got for my daughter so that she would have some more colors to choose from. She really enjoys all the different colors and the paint washes out very easily as advertised. My daughter is 3 and this along with a coloring book can keep her occupied for quite some time.
4,Wacom Graphire Tablet - GREAT but miss the old holder,"This is a fantastic pen mouse. It works just as well as any other Wacom tablet that I've had. I really like the way the pen can be stored away when you're on the go. BUT, I do miss the way the old tablet I had had a built-in upright holder for the pen and that holder didn't move around and about. This new one's plastic holder isn't actually attached to the tablet, so whenever I go to lift the pen out of it, or put the pen in it, the holder moves around, which is a bit of an annoyance."
4,Gets kids started,DJ's Choice More Kids FunGreat sounds & songs for young kids to learn & have fun ... put it on a CD & the kids can listen & sing over & over to theur heart's content
2,"Ticks the boxes, but phew!!","This is a reduction of Donald Kagan's own more scholarly work on the subject for the ordinary reader. If I could have the last 3 weeks of my life back, I'd wait for the Reader's Digest version.Too much detail, a kaleidoscope of characters and locations coming and going, and no real overview. The maps are poor and the descriptions of battles are limited.To the author, who has been immersed in the subject, it may seem like a summary. To someone who picks it up for a read over Christmas, it's a 500 page list of events which take place over decades."
5,Long Live Buzzy,"My friends and I grew up listening to Edgar and Johnny Winter, Little Feat and Springsteen. Than my older brother turned us on to Buzzy! ""PussyCats Can Go Far"" will live forever! We are all waiting for the day that Buzzy's work will be re-released. I have recently found a Buzzy Web site and hope that his good health returns. I want to thank Amazon for their part in keeping his work ""alive"" and for the customers that shared their memories."
4,easy to clean,"Wide mouth, which is hard to find. Very sturdy, seems undentable but light-weight and no worry about plastic contaminants and you can clean with bleach of boiling water if necessary."
1,But animation isn't everything when it comes to birth.,"Sadly, this was the Discovery Channel's video about conception and birth in the US and only in the hospital. It includes images of one c-section, epidural injections, women laboring in pain while lying down and medical personnel only suggesting an epidural for pain relief, not a bath or meditation, doula or birth ball. It also included wonderful, imaginative animation for conception and the growth of the fetus. A more balanced film about birth in the US which includes both hospital and home birth is, ""Born in the U.S.A."" by PatchWork films.Can the Discovery Channel please do more research and give us a video which includes the reason the USA has one of the highest infant mortality rates in the world?"
5,You Won't Find Anything Better Out There,"As a beginner in tarot, I wasn't sure if I'd be able to pick something up and ""do it."" I've read a handful of tarot guides and I found the tone of Ms. Fowler's book to be refreshingly personal, eloquent, and insightful. One feels personally guided through the process, almost as though the author has her arm around you. Her beautifully creative descriptions of the symbols allow the user/practitioner to access the depths within them. At the same time, her description/use of seven levels for each card highlights the importance of striving to articulate one's question in order to arrive at the most specific possible outcome (this may sound complicated, but it's not--and the levels are so well described that the result is a greater level of guidance.) Finally, the guide does not rely on a specific deck of cards--all you need is a regular ""playing"" deck and you're off!I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone and everyone--it'll change your life."
2,Not a very good movie.,"This plot didn't make a lot of sense. We are told dragons have taken over the skies of earth, yet we hardly see any flying around. I rented this because Gerard Butler is in it. He has the best lines then gets killed off. Christian Bale has an angry expression on his face for the entire movie, I bet he was sorry he signed the contract. Matthew McConnaughy chews up the scenery with gusto, he looks like the only one having any fun. If the dragons only eat ash, why do they chomp on people? This is for hardcore sci-fi/fantasy fans only."
4,Challenging puzzles...on poor paper,"I have to agree with some of the other reviewers--the paper quality makes it difficult to use an eraser. Also the grids are very small, so putting in trial numbers is very difficult.Sudoku-book publishers of the world, here's my recommendations:1) Use decent paper, stuff that doesn't wear away with erasing or has ink seeping thru.2) Make the grids big (6 inch by 6 inch, for example).3) Make the book such that each page lays flat, perhaps by using a spiral binder.4) Reinforce the back cover of the book, so that one can do their sudoku while wedged into a tiny seat on public transportation.Meanwhile, do what I do: go to Michael Mepham's website: [...] and print out big blank sudoku grids. Fill them in with the starting numbers from the book and start solving!"
4,Awesome Book,The book The Attributes of God is an awesome well written book.Providing insight and causing you to really think about who God is.... and his true Power and what he represents. I would reccommend this boook to anyone who is looking to get a greater understanding of our God.
2,COOK BOOK,USED TWO RECIPES SO FAR. NEITHER CAME OUT WELL. EVERYTHING WAS OVER DONE. STILL TRYING THOUGH
3,Not the first book you should read on Madison,"This book is not for someone who is looking for a little light reading on the Father of the Constitution. Ketchum has written an incredibly detailed book with tons of information on our smallest president. However, the book is quite dull. Ketchum writes it in such a way that the books seems to drag on. The information is interesting but Ketchum seems to take too much time examining things during Madison's life that really aren't that important.If you want a book that attacks you with information on Madison, this is your book. If you are looking for something fun to read, find another book."
4,127 Hours,I could have given it a higher rating if there weren't so much bad language and nudity in it. I don't know why such a good story needs all that ugly stuff to sell it.
1,i'm sure i'd love it if i didn't have to read it for school,I think the subject says enough. I'm sure I'd love it if I didn't have to read it for school. I only dislike this book because I have to write an in-class essay for it tommorrow. it's too annoying and i hate the point of view because it's something to be discussed. I'm ure I'd love A Seperate Peace if I didn't have to write an analysis of Finny and Gene's relationship. damn school.
2,"A long, boring, plodding stinker","This is plodding, predictable film making at its worst, with a bad script, silly costumes, and were it not so truly amateurish and awful, you might even discern how truly revolting its theme is -- the idea of children killing other children for sport. Great, just what we need at a time when maniacs are running loose with guns in this country randomly shooting people. Not even worth a rental. This one's a paint-by-the-numbers snooze."
4,classic yet egotistical young woman,Jane Austen's works are an extreme favorite of mine but this is not my favorite. Emma is really snobby and a meddler. Hers is not a personality I would want others to emulate but she is well meaning. Mr. Knightley is the best character of all. There are several very fun characters in this novel.
2,"Keyboard is Great, but Mouse Fails","I purchased the wireless keyboard and mouse combination. The keyboard worked great--I would give it 5 stars--but I couldn't get the mouse to establish radio contact. I exchanged it for a new one twice more with the same result. I am a fairly technical person (so is my roommate) and since set up is not complicated at all, I'm quite certain that the reason for the mouse's failure was not a result of something I and my roommate did.And there is no customer service number.I would wait until this technology develops a little more. Then I would jump on it. The wireless keyboard, for it's part was well worth the money."
2,Broke within 4 weeks,This thing works great but its easy to break it at the top pivot point and there is no repair possible because it needs to pivot at that point. Glueing is out of the question. I am going to buy another one because it works so good and be really careful with it.
1,goodnight mr tom,"I had to read this book in 24 hours 4 school and i was staying up til 2:30 am reading it, but it was dead boring anyway. the first few chapters were just boring, until Will was taken to his mother and was rescued, but, like the beginnning, the end chapters had no action and were so boring"
2,Substandard Cuisinarts Product,"My wife worked for Cuisinarts. She thought their products were excellent. I own a Cuisinarts Convection Oven that is really super. Their four-cup coffeemaker, sorry to say, is junk - well below Cuisinarts standards. It drips and dribbles. It is awkward to fill. Wait until the first time you start to pour out some scalding hot coffee and the coffee dribbles all over the table, the up-coming steam hits your bare hand, you move your hand and the top of the pot falls off and coffee spills all over! The coffee it brews however is tasty. I would not recommend this pot."
1,"great kettle, but ours developed a leak","This is probably the best kettle I've used (out of maybe four in various countries). It heats water quickly, pours extremely well, is ergonomically designed, and is a pleasure to use, honestly. Our kettle, however, developed a leak at the bottom seal, ranging from a slow to fast drip. Braun no longer services these, so we have to send it in for a simple refund (at our expense). I would definitely considering buying another, however."
5,Great story,I enjoyed this book. Great heroine -great hero. I loved the development of the storyline and the struggle both main characters endured within their hearts. I would read other books by this author.
4,heart rate monitor,The monitor works great and reliably. I feel confident in trusting the readings. Great value for the money.
2,Expensive and short on performance,"I had to return the detector. The button was too hard to press. It also has too blunt of a point so you can not push it into the ground. The return was a little painful. Return instructions were hard to follow, but I finally succeeded."
1,"OMG, I thought Dracula 3000 was dumb... new winner now!","I am of the type who enjoys the cheesy b-movies. For the most part many are well made and at least TRY to be entertaining and I give them that. However, there are those films which turn even my (hardened) stomach. I thought Dracula 3000 was the worst, until I saw this film.Pros: A few cute actressesCons: 99.9% of the film.-Bad acting, people don't know how to enunciate their words to make them seem believable.-No discernible plot-Plot holes-Dumb lines-Pointless lines-Dumb and pointless lines-etc etc.Whatever possessed anyone to create this drivel, under who knows how many varying titles, should be shot.I suppose their aim was to waste a few hours of our time, if so, they succeeded. AVOID THIS MOVIE LIKE THE PLAGUE!!! I mean it!"
4,See it made.,"This is an excellent video showing the technology developed over centuries by great craftsmen to produce not simply a weapon, but a work of art.The video covers the art *and* science of producing a katana - the samurai's sword. It begins with workers making steel from ore. It moves to the swordmaker's art of forging a magnificently crafted weapon perfectly suited for the style of combat the culture revered. It shows that polishing and sharpening are a separate art also practiced by great craftsmen.There is a great deal of science in the video that explains the properties of steel, how it is hardened, and how the weapon requires different steels to accomplish its task.It isn't perfect, but this video is very good!"
5,Worth Every Penny,"The title says it all. Finally, a clear, concise explanation of all the screens, buttons, menus and layouts. What also surprised me is how well this served as a primer on the basics of sound synthesis, i.e. LFO's, Oscillators, Filters etc. Can't recommend it enough."
4,"Spirit filled, profound read",An in depth poetic journey which challenges the spiritual sincerity of our religious training. An honest cry to the Creator and a display of unconditional love. A must read for anyone who is searching to find their true spiritual purpose in this journey. Know who you are and that God created you that way...in love!
5,"Provocative, pathbreaking scholarship","The Culture of Citizenship is provocative, path-breaking scholarship. In it, Thomas Bridges presents liberal political philosophy as in retreat from its traditional confidence in the 'modernist rhetoric of pure theory.' Instead, Bridges argues, figures such as John Rawls are inching toward a 'rhetorical turn' toward context, culture and history, a direction this book seeks to accelerate. To this end, the book explores the often surprising and deeply challenging implications this rhetorical turn holds for the philosophy of politics and culture."
1,false advertizing,the tracks listed for this CD is incorrect. If you look closely at the picture of the CD will you see what the track names are. I bought this CD based upon the track listing and did not recieve what I thought I had oredered. This is the fault of Amazon and not the seller. Buyer beware of Amazon's practices.
1,quit working after one week!,"I bought it to connect my ipad to our TV. Unfortunately, it only worked for less than one work, then only can hear the voice, no video. totally wast time and money!"
4,im hooked on great white,"great white has another great release with hooked. the brash and ballsy attitude of great white shines throughout the cd with some ballads including a great one called afterglow. the only problem is sometimes the lyrics can be pretty dull, and a couple songs like cold hearted lovin and south bay cities are like country music. but all in all this is a great album well worth the price of admission."
5,Followup reading to a very good WWII movie,"Before Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers, there was ""A Bridge Too Far"". Excellent historical account of Operation Market Garden in WWII. This is a movie and a book that I don't get tired of watching or reading."
4,Subtle delight,"This album's dreamlike flow is probably not going to win any instant converts, but give it a chance and it will insinuate itself into your psyche, and you will find yourself taking delight in its many subtle charms. Similar in feel to some of Lucinda Williams' later albums, it is more poppy, less bluesy. It is also more experimental, but not overtly so: The way a high-top is suggested in the drum rolls in ""The Circus Song"", the cool -- as in a wisp of peppermint -- guitar break in ""Without You"", the bodhran opening of ""Reel Me In"". There are layers and details here that will reward repeated listenings with increasing appreciation for what Richey and her producer, Bill Bottrell, have crafted."
1,simply dreadful,"This book contains almost no information. It is simply a series of photos of the author with famous boxers. I believe, but cannot be certain, that it is self-published. A total waste."
2,ho hum,"Although I am a big Dirk fan, I felt that this book fell flat. It just never seemed to catch fire. I enjoyed the total lunacy of 'Sahara' so much more."
3,Missing Joseph,"Elizabeth George has really extended herself in ""Missing George""to the point where the whole story borders on the truly unbelievable. We have colorful and well developed characters, multi-faceted plots and subplots, with teenage problems, witchcraft practicing priest's housekeeper, salacious mother, obnoxious rapist constable, and last but not least the British aristocratic ex CID agent, Thomas Linley. Wow...what's left??Well, there is more. We have thegroom who really doesn't love his pregnant bride to be, who happens to be very very rich, and a priest who doesn't show cause he's been murdered! Then there's the rectory housekeeper who has the hots for the errant groom and vice-versa. When all the above is sorted out and we come to the finish of this convoluted novel, the ending shocks us. Not George's best, by my standard, but readable and reasonably interesting.E.J. Walden, author of ""Operatin Snow Owl"""
3,It does what it needs to do,I admit it my husband and I are knife snobs. We cook a lot at our friends' houses since our house is too small for entertaining. When we do this we usually bring our own knives. So it serves the purpose of being able to safely transport our knives every month or so. If I was going to use it more often (daily) I think I would look for something that held the knives a bit more securely and had a shoulder strap. But for us it does what it needs to do!
2,alex,The game wasn't as updated as I thought it would be. The 2006 NHRA Championship Drag Racing game was more fun to play with the bounses for breaking ET and MPH records and also the tune with crew chief was more infromative. And I also like the match races. So all and all I give the new NHRA game 2 stars. Thanks Alex
3,"Good, but not a classic!","I mistakenly bought this at the store where they didn't have ""Be My Valentine C. B."", so I wasn't aware that this was different. I thought I'd replace our old video, but, as it turns out, the old classic with the briefcases, the heart-shaped shaving lotion, Snoopy clipping a music box Valentine, and Linus hurling chocolates into Snoopy's mouth is not on this DVD. With 2 little ones with me, I did not take the time to read the back. This is for an older crowd. My preschoolers still beg for the old video, while my school kids DO enjoy this DVD (but no contest, the other one wins). I would regret my mistake except that it has 3 ""shows"" on it and supplements the original quite nicely. Just know that the original is not on here and you'll probably be more pleased."
5,Another Book on Kunitz's Crown,"Stanley Kunitz is one hundred years old this year and, if that it's not enough reason to rejoice, he's also published a book, thoughtfuy aided by Genine Lentine, in which he shares his two loves, gardening and writing poetry. And if I name these two passions of Kunitz's in such order is because the garden is at the center of his thought here.Accompanied by interesting photographs -some are remarkable portraits of Stanley- Kunitz words tell the story of his legendary Provincetown garden, and in the process he offers those lessons to his poetic insight.The result is a brief book of love for craft, in this case what caring after trees teaches you and what writing a poem entails and demands from his maker.I'm honored and elated to be reading some new words from such wise elder of the poetic word."
2,premature review,"i was hard on this release upon first listen, but, it does sound better after a few spins, i really do like ''narc'', ''c'mere'' and ''slow hands''"
4,is good,"This stereo is very beautiful and it sounds perfect for the pricethe audio functions are very goodBoss is a good brand, I have had many amplifiers of this brand and they have never failed"
4,Good assortment of music,"The ""On the Line"" soundtrack is a definite must-have for NSync fans since it's not only from the movie featuring two guys from the group, but it also has two never-before-released songs from the group. In addition, the album contains music by other pop stars like Britney Spears and BB Mak. There's also a little country thrown in the the final song ""Ready to Fall"" sung by Meredith Edwards. Overall, the CD has a variety of musical genres respresented, but most of the songs are definitely love-oriented. There is a great mixture of tempo in that some songs are slow and romantic while others are upbeat and fun. Definitely a good buy though!!"
5,"Great playing from Bobby, Joe, Bob, and Bill! WOW!!","This disc is fantastic. Would expect this from such a great lineup. But what makes the whole thing swing is the top arranging of wonderful music from Earl Zindars creative writing chops. The title track sure; Elsa, of course, especially in the hands of Bobby Shew. But dig the other less familiar tunes from EZ: Silverado Trail, Mother of Earl, City Tune and Return to Love, especially. Would that Bill Evans had his turn at these with, say, Tom Harrell, Larry Schneider, and say Marc Johnson as on We Will Meet Again. This disc is THAT good. Melodic, touching, cerebral and melancholic at once. And don't leave out fine bass work from Jeff D'Angelo and Cunliffe's harmonies enhanced with the trombone of Bruce Paulson. Both players are alumni of the Doc Severinsen band. All very sweet stuff. My favorite being Bill's fine dissonant chord treatment of Elsa with Bobby's flugelhorn on top."
1,WATCH SEPTEMBER CLUES,"I used to praise this DVD untill I found out their discussion group wont allow ANY no plane theories to be discussed and will boot you out for even mentioning September Clues, which is a free download."
5,Nostalgia,I bought this for my Mum who is 94. She absolutely loved it and I did too. It's just what we wanted to see - the old Xmas shows with Andy and his brothers and the Osmonds when they were very young - so cute! Brought back many wonderful memories of christmas. Defintely worth buying if you grew up with these shows.
1,"Did not work, loud humming coming from sub","I bought this with the hopes of having an average system for not much money. After researching the product online I found the system can have problems with shielding. However, after trying the speakers into several different plugs I determined there is something wrong with the sub itself. The humming noise gets worse when all the wires are plugged in. Requested return with the hopes of getting a replacement system that is operational. Once that happens I will update."
1,theatrical editions only? wtf?,this is not the one to buy. will wait for extended editions. double dippin money gobblin crap. very disapointed.
4,True to the HALO universe,"I have been a HALO fan for years and enjoy the books and games. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of this movie - unique story, good acting and quality special effects. However, this is not an action movie, although the action picks up at the end. My wife also enjoyed the movie and knows almost nothing of the HALO universe. Hopefully we will see 343 make another film."
5,GREAT...BUT WHERE ARE THE LATER SEASONS???,"THIS IS ANOTHER GREAT SEASON, BUT WHY SO INTERMINALLY LONG BETWEEN RELEASES OF SEASONS? THE FIRST FEW SEASONS CAME OUT WAY BACK WHEN THERE WERE VIDEO STORES. THERE IS SUCH DEMAND FOR THESE SEASONS FROM DIE HARD HITCH FANS LIKE MYSELF. I DON`T UNDERSTAND THE DELAY. LET`S ALL CONTACT UNIVERSAL. MAYBE A LARGE RESPONSE WILL GET US SOME MORE SEASONS SOONER."
2,"Helps with the carpal tunnel, but wears quickly","This Kensington mouse pad definitely helps reduce my CTS pain, about as much as the Handstands Ergo-Mat Memory Foam mousepad which sells elsewhere on Amazon for the same price. I've used both pretty heavily for a year now.HOWEVER, the Ergo-Mat still looks like new - and I mean absolutely just-unwrapped new. In contrast, this Kensington pad is ready for the trash, with the surface degrading and color gone at all wear points. Even the gel pad is sagging. If it wasn't mine, I wouldn't touch it.And the layout is silly, with extra material off to the right where your hand will rarely go, and not enough area where it matters. This is continually annoying during use.So - whether or not the Handstands pad appeals to you, I'd pass on this Kensington item. It's way overpriced considering its poor quality. Kensington has sacrificed function for style, and you soon lose the latter because of the cheap materials. Typical big-company approach."
4,Not to be overlooked,Remembering whether I read this before or not was difficult so I purchased it for my Kindle & loved every page of it.
4,Thoughts in Upheaval,"Though Velikovsky's theories are varied and somewhat happen-stance, his suggestions make one take notice or our planet's strange past. Like many other researcbers Velikovsky tries too hard to make ""everything"" fit his ideas when one or two would be satisfactory. By making everything ""fit"" together he tends to discredit even his most sound concepts. Still, an enlightening read."
3,Good tips,"Being a beginner knitter, I rather like this book than the Knit Hats book. Although the 2 books have color knitting, this one on mittens gives out several tips on how to continue with the color patterns when increases are made for the mittens and the explanation can be easily understood. Just wish they teach how to continue the color patterns if there are decreases."
5,I didn't expect such a GOOD MUSIC!,"I really enjoy the Army Of Lovers' songs and especially songs from this album like Crucified, Say Goodbye To Babylon... Songs like Someone Somewhere and Obsession are one of the best I've ever heard. Also I very recommend to you their songs - Sebastien and Carry My Urn To Ukraine - unfortunately they are not included in this incredible album. Highly recommended for this decent price."
1,I think they put a cheapo conditioner in the jar and sent it.,"The prduct inside the conditioner is not real. It is so thin, less conditioing than a $6 pantene conditioner. I believe the seller ""haircare24inc"" has packaged a cheaper product in the loreal jar and sent it. It is heavy so not worthwhile to send it back and pay all the postage ( about $15 both ways ) so I just kept it but would hate for anyone else to be duped."
4,"An intellectual toy, even though it doesn't appear as such","My (brainiac) daughter asked for this for her birthday, so I got it.She loves playing it with her equally brainiac brother, but honestly, I don't get the darn thing. It's kind of like Chess (which even that is a challenge for me) with laser beams.I know that she doesn't play it much any more (lack of intelligent players perhaps?), but it is a very cool game with a lot of strategy involved.If your kid is pretty smart, I'd say ""buy it"" and let the game help them grow intellectually. If it ends up sitting in the closet collecting dust, it's better than buying them a gift card to some type of ""ShopMart"" store where they'll blow their money."
3,Not enough coverage on endings with pieces involved,"While there is tons of K+P vs K or K+P vs K+P coverage, there isn't really enough of say, B vs N, or R endings. Ok for what it does cover, but not complete."
5,Fantastic,I have a daughter that has a passion for coloring books. Bought this as part of a Christmas gift for her and needless to say she was very pleased.
2,Well. Let's see here.,"I've seen all the spidey movies. The old batman and Christopher Nolan's batman trilogy. Also seen Great super hero anime movies like Hulk vs. and the batman anime movies along with the punisher war zone, thor, Blade's movies, arnold's movies (all of them, action that is), Matrix, Transporter 1 and 2, Michael Jai White action flicks, the list goes on. I'm a big action and i have a very large movie collection. I must say though that this movie just doesn't do it for me. It seemed boring, kind of slow, just didn't have enough/much action in it and what was there was not that big of a deal. Really. My friend likes it and i don't see why. The story is really nothing to get excited about and isn't what you would call captivating. I rate this by far 2.5 out of 5 stars. To be honest, on my first watch i couldn't even finish it it was that weak. Maybe 3 stars, but check out all the other ones first or buy them. They are worth you time and money. Check out my Listmania's"
4,an impresive sequal,"Listen 50 is hot he has his own style and it's catchy an good for Hip-Hop. I would reccomend this album to people that love hooks an partyin'i love this sequel. /Candy Shop/ is as good if not better than in da club. /We gotta love thing/is a well told relationship story. Amazin featuring Olivia is impressive and most of all /PIGGY BANK/ Were he dissis' Jadakiss, Shine and Fat Joe its hot so go an cop dat not quite better than THE DOCUMENTARY! cAsPeR"
5,A really fun book,"Length:: 0:15 MinsThis book is incredibly fun if you're into fantasy cartooning.Ben Caldwell has filled the pages with sketches and tips to drawing all sorts of fantasy characters, ranging from heroes, villains, fairies to beasts. The tips given are not just on drawing, but also on developing characteristics and personality into them. That's character design. He talks about everything, from the hair, eye shadows, wrinkles, costumes, postures, smiles and basically anything that you can see.There's a companion website to the book called Action Cartooning. You can find more art, comics and a community forum.(More pictures are available on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)"
5,"Excellent Book. Good follow up to ""Voyage of the Devilfish"".",If you like Tom Clancy you'll love Dimercurio
3,simple fix to failure to work,"Like many other failures mine would not turn on. Called Cuisinart; although within guarantee period they needed receipt, Visa bill not sufficient. Simple mechanical fix: remove the bottom cover of the base recepticle Middle contact needed to be bent toward contact point on pot. My failure caused by overheating and bending of this contact. I crilled 4 small holes in top of base unit; improved ventilation should help prevent future problem. Works fine now. We love the pot; its too bad that poor design results in such a bad rating."
2,Arabic For Dummies,The author of Arabic For Dummies is very thorough and educated.My problem is that I need a teacher because Arabic is NOT for dummies.
4,Use it with other books on blackwork,"To be fair, in contention with what the first reviewer said, there are a few patterns given in the book. See one page I have included in the Images above. That said, there are really few given...but that's no the purpose of this book. It's only 48 pages long and it's all about designing your own picture or sampler and incorporating your own diaper patterns. ""Diaper"" means repeated patterns such as the various blocks of designs in the cover's sampler on the left. (What's funny in the book is that either the chart is upside down or the picture on the cover is!)If you enjoy blackwork, there are many other designing books, books with charts, diaper patterns or pictures and histories that you can find. Here are some of my favorites:BlackworkBlackwork (Essential Stitch Guide)Blackwork Embroidery (Dover Embroidery, Needlepoint)New Anchor Book of Blackwork Embroidery StitchesTraditional Blackwork Samplers (Needlecrafts Series)The Art of Blackwork Embroidery"
4,This is what I expected,This toaster is what I expected it to be. It toasts well and looks reasonably nice. Some of the buttons are a bit ' plasticy'.
4,There Will Be Trouble Only If You Don't Buy This CD!!!,"Bad Company's Here Comes Trouble is an excellent cd with great music. It has it all..from cruising songs ""here comes trouble"" and ""were going to take this town"" to romantic songs such as ""this could be the one"" and ""Little Angel"". Though my favorite song on the cd is ""Stranger than fiction"". If your looking for an excellent bad company cd then you definately need go no farther than this. This is the cd you want."
2,"Sole was comfy, upper had a pressure point though","The look of these and the comfort of the sole were great. They gave plenty of room to my wide feet. The upper however dug into the top of my foot and was extremely uncomfortable. It was simply a bad design. Just one point of the whole upper pulled down as you walked forward, almost as if you had a small rope holding it down. What I had to do was put thick moleskin underneath at the back of the upper, and I had to take a razor and slice the edges at the base on both sides of the upper, this allowed the upper a little more movement so it didn't cut in so badly. I would have been a lot happier after having to go through all this if the thongs were only about $10."
2,NOT EXACTY FAMILY FARE,"Teenager Pierre's father dies in a car accident, leaving him alone with his mother, a sexy, worldly woman. To put it mildly, Pierre has a ""crush"" on his mum. Perhaps unusually or not, given the spate of older women seducing children lately, the mother also fancies her son. Isabelle Huppert is enchanting and self-assured as the mother. Louis Garrel is the come-of-age son. MA MERE takes you into sadism, nudity, sex and incest. Not exactly family fare. Ultimately, MA MERE goes nowhere and, as if to prove that point, offers an alternative ending."
2,Motorola HS850,"The headset was easy to connect to my cell phone and fits well on my ear. The problem I have is that the volume just does not get loud enough for me, and really that's what it's all about. Being able to speak clearly and to hear the person on the other end and with this headset (for me) it's just not possible."
2,It's hard to quibble at this price BUT...,"It's hard to quibble with this DVD at this low price but I will anyway. Overall it was disappointing. About half of the performances were lackluster at best and the sound quality on some (remember this is a showpiece for the medium) were underwhelming. I was particularly surprised at the distracting camera work on Billy Joel's number. I love everything Billy Joel but seeing him 'attacked' by multiple cameras was too much. The performances and audio from Stevie Ray Vaughn, Shawn Colvin, Mary Chapin Carpenter, and Tony Bennett were the better numbers. The overall best was Yo-Yo Ma's ""1B"". I have none of his music in my large CD collection but this piece was a visual and sonic standout.If Sony wants to impress with DVD technology, I think they could do a lot better than this. Quibble, quibble."
1,"Flimsy, Not for anything heavier than your palm pilot","I purchased the original lapdesk that this product is based on. While this looks the same in the picture, this item is meant for a much much lighter laptop than any I have used. Might be good for the ultra-sub-notebook set, but not much good for anything modestly sized. I suggest that you look for another lapdesk."
5,This is one of the very best books for beginners.,"The Forsyth's teach all the basics for beginners in this very comprehenhive book. Both have gone on to become very respected all breed and Best in Show judges. They were mentors to the incomparable handler, George Alston. Their book is very comprehensive, and a must for any beginner."
5,amazing benefits,"i did ballet growing up and continued til i was almost 18.. at the time my body was lean and my posture was great and i was flexible, fit & energetic.now i am almost 30 with a kid( you can imagine the difference), and after doing this dvd only once, i feel like there is hope for me and the rest of the world!this is a great low-impact workout that stretches and elongates each muscle in the body.i am really happy with it and i look forward to my second workout (dvd 2)one more thing, the narrator is amazing and the presentation is fantastic..."
3,"Not bad, but not great.","I enjoyed reading this book and was dying from laughter most of the time. This book would have made a good blog-type commentary but falls a little short of being a ""must-have"" book for men who have been victims of radical feminism.While his anecdotes are very entertaining to read, his conclusions about politics, religion, and females in general are trite and unremarkable.As an avid reader of anti-feminism books, I give this one three out of five stars."
5,Must Have,"I loved this book, and highly recommend it. Easy short stories to read. They say there a million ways to the top, this book will help you decide on what WILL work for you in sharing the way to brilliant compensation."
2,Jar leaked after 15 months,"I used an Oster for 12 years and decided to get a bigger blender after it's broken. Since I have a wonderful KitchenAid refrigerator, I went with this blender. Unfortunately, it has a serious design flaw - the plastic jar is not strong enough for the operations. After using it for three times a week for 15 months, the bottom of the jar started to crack and eventually leaked while blending. A replacement jar is costly and there's no guarantee it won't leak again based on feedback from other reviewers. I do NOT recommend this blender and will go with a different brand next time."
2,Latest Gur not up to her usual standard,"Gur here provides too much exposition (work environment, characters at national TV and police headquarters) at the expense of plot and character development. Further, the novel is weakened by the extravagant significance given a single war-time atrocity. Benefit of the doubt - maybe the author didn't have time to polish the ms, apparently completed just before her 5/05 death. Start with Saturday Morning Murder and read the other four. Only read this if you already know the series & want to see what she does with her long-running characters."
3,Conditioner and Detangler,I think the straight silicone works a little better but this is a great detangler for our Cocker Spaniel. Coat is shiney.
4,Well Done!,"I've read some reviews really bashing this film, but I'm with the majority here. It was really well done! The myth and magic is presented very subtly in the film. The locations where it was filmed are fantastic. It is the best and most entertaining rendition of Beowulf since '13th Warrior' and Hey! No Antonio to wrench the storyline. Very Cool....."
4,Brief introduction to Newton,"Gleick's biography of Newton serves as a solid, albeit brief, introduction to one of the world's greatest scientific geniuses. The author touches on all of Newton's major points, from his groundbreaking work in physics and calculus, to his peculiar personality traits, his insecurities, and vicious fights with other contemporary scientists such as Hooke and Liebniz.The book makes use of excellent source material, and the footnotes are excellent. The major complaint with the book is that it is too brief, and does not fully explore Newton's life to any signficant depth. However, it does serve a brief introduction that enables the reader an overview of Newton, and a springboard to seek out more detailed accounts should the reader desire."
4,A really good movie,"I have read the book that this movie was based upon and I thought that the movie was better than the book. This film has it all romance, angst, a love triangle and plenty of action. I love films that force me to suspend reality and really believe, for a little while, that actions and events could occur in real life! This film is for die hard Twilight Saga Fans!!!"
5,A users guide to the cosmos,"Our family are so absorbed into this great guide BR. It showes us from the big bang to galaxies, stars, planets and moons. It is definitely a primer for anyone who has ever looked up at the night sky and wondered."
5,Jimmy hall sings the blues,"I bought this CD after I was restocking some old music and wanted a Wet Willie CD with Keep On Smilin. I discovered Jimmy Hall, lead singer was still alive and well and had a couple of new CDs out. I really like this CD and about a year after I bought it Jimmy Hall showed up near me in Thomson GA for the Blind Willie Blues Festival. It was a fantastic day, Jimmy Hall and the Prisoners of Love performed. Jack Pearson who plays guitar on this CD was there and they made a great team. Even better to hear Rendezvous with the Blues live on a hot Georgia day in the middle of basically a well groomed cow pasture. At 62 he can still belt it out and sounds better live than on records. I am a total fan and have purchased anything I can find with his music on it."
2,Not one of Duke's best!,"This western has its moments - but there is a fatal mistake in the final shoot-out: John Wayne actually manages to fire 16 or 17 shots (just count them)with his six-shooter without having any second in the movie to re-load. Hathaway should have caught that! It is also unlikely that Wayne - who is nearly 60 - could be big-brother to Michael Anderson,Jr. - who is about 18 years old in the movie. If you watch closely, there are other mistakes. The director must have been tired. The movie could have been much better!"
2,Not Really What I Was Expecting...,"I bought all the NM (at least up that point) cds at once and listened to them in order. I listened to this one a few times, but it wasnt really compelling to me upon repeated listens.I like to keep an open mind, and i do enjoy lots of different kinds of music. This is pretty much basic black metal that you could hear from any hundreds of bands. Nokturnal Mortum have much more talent than those other bands, so why they decided to be just like them with this album just boggles my mind.If true black metal is what you really really love, then you'll probably dig this. I would personally recommend Goat Horns, Lunar Poetry and if you can find it Weltanschauung."
4,"An interesting read, many layers to explore","I read this in a reading group program. Interesting ideas, compulsive behavior,multiple dysfunctional personalities, serious organizational failures, and more.Well written, an enjoyable reading experience."
4,"Good, but not Gibson","Snow Crash is an excellent book. The first chapter is terribly funny tongue in cheek humor that sets the scene for a slightly more humorous look at the cyberpunk world than is offered by most authors. But the book does not continue like this. It progresses onwards, garnering a plot in the process. It does not possess the darkness that makes true cyberpunk (William Gibson) so great. Not to say that the book is not worth reading, but keep your expectations low."
2,Not for meetings etc,"This is a good voice recorder, if you want to record notes to yourself. However, the microphone is not nearly sensitive enough for recording meetings, presentations etc. Standing just six feet away I could hardly hear myself on the recording. Also, the display is very small and the readout is hard to read. I had to refer to the manual which had a blowup of the display to see what it was showing. On the plus side, it has good computer compatibility, no drivers/software needed, and mp3 recording."
4,"Excellent, with unexpected twists","I'm frustrated with people who ""liked the book except for the ending"" - although that was also my first take. What everyone is missing is that this is Heinlein's send-up of the classic man-meets-mysterious-woman-and-together-they-save-the-universe space opera (which both Richard and Gwen Hazel wrote!). As for the ending, Heinlein, like his characters, dislikes the Heisenberg/Goedel unknowability implicit in present-day physics, and says there must be something beyond it. Then he makes his point, by leaving Pixel (Schrodinger's cat) and his protagonists in a 50:50 live-or-die situation...and ending the book there. Right, the ending doesn't satisfy; neither, says Heinlein, does contemporary physics. Then see To Sail Beyond The Sunset for what comes next, both for the characters and in science."
3,"Flightplan - some turbulence, but it stays aloft","My problem going into Flightplan was that the trailer, like many other recent movies, gave away much of the story. As seen in most of the advertisements, Jodie Foster plays a woman who loses her daughter in the middle of a trans-Atlantic flight. Her family has suffered a great deal previous to this, and the circumstances of what has transpired are shrouded in mystery.Without giving away any of the remaining surprises, let me just say that there is some decent entertainment to be found here. Jodie Foster, Peter Saarsgard, and Sean Bean (often typecast as a villain) all give strong performances, working from a script that is sometimes thoughtful but ultimately has no bite. As a result, the pacing is noticeably uneven. As the plot unfolded, I found myself wishing that the overall film had more bite to it. Nothing has the impact that it should.On the whole, I recommend saving this one for a rental. Final grade: B-"
2,Lots of Leaks,I am not really happy with these covers. My daughter can wear them for about an hour and a half until she soaks right through her pants! I think the cheap vinyl pants work better.
3,The Problem is with Customer Service,"I loved the snow blower but on about the third use the plastic blade unit broke. I had hit it against a railing so I understood that I had a role in this. I ordered two extra roller units from Snow Joe. They have not shipped after a week. I wrote several emails that only received automated responses. When I called, I was told it should ship later this week (two weeks to ship basic parts.) I asked why and the man said ""We are very backed up."" This is a neat product but the customer service is very poor."
1,"this is plastic, not stainless on the inside","I was very disappointed that this is plastic on the inside, not stainless. I don't like the taste of hot plastic. They should update the description as a plastic mug with a stainless steel sheath."
2,Pull them in with riffs and then some.,"Collective soul's guitar playing is still amazing. But it sounds like with this album somebody told them how big a hit their previous song Heavy from Dosage was and maybe their producer decided to mold some of their songs after it. It sounds like while they were playing around and creating new songs, they found a few riffs and decided to base their entire song all around a riff with uninspired sound in between the catchy riffs. I don't sense as much of an urgency in any of the songs as previously. Maybe it was too early for a new album, they could have taken some more time on their new songs. Their experimentation with new sounds comes out fine, but thats about it. Still, a piece of music is meant to communicate something, and with the right mood and the right track at the same time, each of these songs can be great."
5,Perfect for small jobs,"I love Le Creuset enameled cast-iron cooking equipment. It works wonderfully and clean-up is pretty quick. I've had this piece for a month and have used it 4 times already. The ""precision pour"" lip lives up to its name as I could pour a thick sauce into a serving dish easily without making a mess. I purchased it during a promotional sale and it was a steal considering how useful it's been to me already."
1,Nyko Power Pak Doesn't Work,"Great idea, but it doesn't work. It seems to charge okay, but it's very loose when you connect it to a Color Gameboy, and slips out easily, losing power - and the game. I got two for two kids, and neither one works in either Gameboy."
4,works,This was recommended by a friend and I had my doubts ..but it really has made a difference to my nails which were such a mess due to stress and and the fact that I am a nurse and always washing my hands! I notice the difference if I stop using it for a while!
5,Delightful reference book,"I got the last copy in the store and all others will just have to go wanting! I spent hours searching for an herb book that would fullfill all my interests and questions on general herb usuage and this book is it. I keep it in the ""library"", that's how good it is!!"
2,thank god i watched this on cable...,"i waited for this to come on cable, and was glad i did! i am a fan of SMG, and i think she is a good actress, but why is she always in such bad movies? i know what u did last summer was probably the best one so far. this movie started off okay, but i kept thinking it must get better, and it doesn't! i did enjoy sarah and she had a great wardrobe and the soundtrack was good, but this film was just not as good a romance as i hoped it to be. it was so-so, not great. if you like very unrealistic romantic comedies, and SMG, you may like this."
1,We as customers should be upset..I know I am.,$40 for 1/2 a season...thats $80 for Season 4...YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING...I won't buy this now or ever at this price!!!
5,Bocelli's Verdi,"As a long time admirer of Andrea's voice, I was really looking forward to this CD. BUT, nothing before had prepared me for how INCREDIBLE this music would be sung by Andrea! His ability to reach the heart and soul of the listener is second to NONE.I DO listen to many other tenors, and while some of them maybe be technically better (except in the area of diction, where Bocelli reigns supreme), not one of them has moved me as Andrea does.If you like Andrea or Verdi, even if you don't... this CD is wonderful!"
3,Mexican Baroque? That is laughable!,"""Mexican Baroque""?????? Mexico was not a country until 1821. Sounds like the record company is trying to rewrite history ie. prop up Mexicans to make it sound like they have a rich cultural history or something to that effect. Funny. During the Baroque period, that land was part of New Spain."
4,Knight gives a good introduction to the culture.,"Nick Knight's book Skinhead gives the reader a good first introduction to the skinhead culture. In an overview of the origins of skinheads, Knight is able to bring in the style and ideology which embodies a skinhead. He distinguishes between the different types of skinheads - racist and non-racist - and gives history on their mixing.This book includes a good music guide which describes the Jamaican birth of ska and it's immigration to England in the 1960's. There is also an illistrated fashion section which in itself will justify for some the purchase of this book. In conclusion Knight gives a wonderful photo album of skinheads which shouldn't be missed. Although not as detailed as Spirit of '69: a Skinhead Bible, by George Marshall, this is a good book to give an quick picture of a youth sub-cultured misunderstood for far too long."
5,Price Hike.. this was cheaper several months ago,"This is a great device and I have since given mines away to someone who needs it and I will need to purchase another, but this price is way more than what I paid several months ago.So I give this item five starts because this is made of quality, and records very well and clear, how ever the price has been hiked and it makes no sense to pay this much for this item.This item comes with a case and has a lot of options for a recorder. Nice buttons, and nice quality look and feel. The case is nice because it keeps the screen from getting scratched.Shop around before you pay this current price. I paid $50.00 for this months ago."
3,"""explosion""","I have read about 11 bipolar memoirs in order to gain insight into the daily struggle. While it definitely added a few more pieces to the big picture,I found it more taxing to read than others due to the intensity and the way in which it is written. However, if you want to get inside someone's head, you have to be willing to go along for the ride."
3,Works well but.....,"It is very powerful and the battery lasts a long time. Only downsides are 1) The plastic adjustment comb is hard to remove and put back which makes me think it will break sooner than later. 2) When you use the blade w/o the comb, it is very sharp and irritates the skin. The Norelco G370 is a much better product. It has more attachments, the blade is smoother and doesn't irritate, and the comb is easier to remove. However, it doesn't hold its charge as well as this does."

1,Portacrib,"I was looking to buy a Port-A-Crib mattress.I ended up with a pack n play mattress.Port-A-Crib is a brand name, not a portacrib.Not your fault - fault of the manufacturers or the sellers. They give no size or that their portacrib mattress is for a pack n play.Totally dissatisfied."

How about a newer and better pic?The set list is pretty good and Nielsn funny asall get out in the outakes, of the Australia 1streleased draft of this, which I got from mykaussie.com first."
4,Essential reading for any prospective parent.,"In spite of being only a rather slim paperback , this little book contains enough clearly written and essentially accurate information to make it an excellent introduction to the problem facing young parents : do we vaccinate our children or not? Written in a very understandable manner and with very compelling evidence , I found myself wishing that this book had been available when my own children were young.This book quickly reviews many of the common childhood diseases , the complications possible , and then proceeds to discuss the effectivness of the vaccines and their associated risks. Evidence is presented that the vaccines , although highly touted for disease prevention , are mostly ineffective and risky. The only reason I rated this book 4 stars instead of five is the book is TOO concise and some of the subject matter requires additional treatment. The evidence presented , however ,is very compelling , and I highly recommend this book."
4,great sounding adaptation of Christmas and other songs,"This CD has great arrangements, talented performers and is very easy to listen to. There are some cool modern adaptations of classic Christmas songs as well as other great compositions covering various styles such as swing/rockabilly, alternative, rock, pop and dance. 2 thumbs up."
3,not quite there,"After groundbreaking albums, Shabooh Shoobah and The Swing, Listen Like Thieves seems to stagnate. To me this album does not leap forward like the previous ones and although it contains hits like What You Need, Listen Like Thieves and This Time it does not grab me and make me listen. Oddly the album does contain two outstanding tracks in Kiss The Dirt and Shine Like It Does which lift it above mediocre. One X One and Same Direction are among INXS' better rock songs. All up the band seems to have a pleasant snooze with this one between the fantastic ""The Swing"" and the record breaking ""Kick"" which is to appear two years later. A good steady album but a little below their best efforts."
4,differant styles,"I like the hangers, but my order had 4 packs of regular hangers and 2 packs of heavy duty hangers so my hangers in my closet do not match."
1,Don't bother,"The Wireless Turbo Mouse would seem to be a good bet, however it suffers from a very poor implementation of the scrolling ring when used on the web. The problem is it should advance the screen smoothly, but it's annoyingly jerky, and therefore continues to be annoying day after day, month after...ect. I called Kennsignton in an effort to tell them my thoughts, and was listened to patiently, but it was a waste of time. The point is, this company had a lot going for it years ago, but now seems to be coasting down hill. Also, the battery needs replacement about once a week, so if you buy this, plan on a recharger and extra set of C cells."
2,OK for occasional use,OK for low cost rain gear. Sizes seemed to run a bit small. Plastic is very lightweight. OK for price paid.
4,Handy,I am so happy my wife ordered this for me. The router base is one of my most used item for my dremel. I use it for all of the Boy Scout projects and crafts for my wife also for my daughters Girl Scouting project.
4,O Great One,"Allison is among the foremost contemporary interpreters of Kant and this collection, spanning both the German sage's theoretical and practical philosophy, is a gem. In the year I spent trying to master Kant, before submitting to a mild form of dementia, Allison stood on my night table as a constant source of support and clarification, as well as an object of rage and sometimes just as a place to put cups. I can't recommend this book enough."
4,Beware,"I bought this item from butterflyphoto with no shipping. Item that was sent is refurbished with a 90 day warranty instead of 3 years. I love the can opener, but am angry because I paid for a new item not a refubrished. And they will not answer emails. The can opener is great."
4,Always left hanging,"The acting is outstanding. The stories are gritty and true to life. Most aspects of this series are excellent. The constant use of split screen technique...not so much. It becomes distracting and does little to enhance story telling. What hurts this series most are the endings. We are left waiting for some sort of an answer at the end of each and every episode, instead we're left watching that black screen with the credits rolling. Note to Lynda LaPlante ""A little payoff for the audience please, after all the emotional investment in the well drawn characters we want some retribution""."
4,Really good teaching video,"A really good teaching video. My son and I enjoyed it, and we both learned much from it. Pete covers some really important areas, it just needed to be just a litte more clear in a couple areas to rate a ""5"". A baseball teaching/coaching library would not be complete without it."
1,Straw men and lose facts,"Most of this film involves attacks on easy targets or attempts to mock decent people. One of the more outrageous claims, that Jesus is just a result of plagarism is based on utter crap: See [...]."
5,Olay definity cream 1.7 oz.,"This product is wonderful....leaves your face moisturized; yet with a clean, non-greasy, light feel. Lightly and pleasantly scented. The only thing missing from Olay Definity Cream is sunscreen (which you CAN find in the Olay Definity Moisturizing Lotion (SPF15). Love it!"
4,Good but time-consuming,"I very much enjoyed this game, but be warned it will sap time. It led me to quit playing computer games!The one criticism I have of it is that the automatic battle resolution doesn't take account of your previous proven skill as a general. As such I ended up controlling every little battle so as to maintain my edge. If the auto-resolution took account of your past performance in manually-controlling battles, rather than just comparing troop strength, it would be much more enjoyable to allow the computer to resolve unimportant (or expectedly boring) battles."
1,One side doesn't work,"Sound from one earbud is poor. Balance control on device I use it on is fine. Fine for listening to news, but not recommended for music."
1,Atopalm MLE Body Lotion,Doesn't work! You want a good all over body cream- try VANICREAM. My whole family uses it; even my 2 yr old son who has bouts of mild eczema.
5,An excellent read!!!!!!,"I belive that it is good to read books about the tarot to give you some informative insight as a beginner, but it sticks better when you have a workbook, especially as in-depth as this one. Mary Greer touches on, if not everything, then many things you should know about the tarot. Like a reviewer already stated, it's not just about memorizing the cards (which could be very tedious), but learning how to build your own feeling and intuition for the cards, and relating them to your situations in your own life. By the time your done with this book, you will feel much more comfortable with tarot and your intuition relating to your life. I highly recommend this book because not just your regular tarot book, it's more like SERIOUSLY learning something new! I believe that experienced tarot card readers can benifit from this. This book is a challenge, but it's a lot of fun! Before you can read others, you should know how to read your self! I hope I've convinced you! Happy reading!"
4,Withstood the test of time for me,"This album is worth a listen. I don't like this band as much as Pearl Jam, Sound Garden, Bush or several others, but I am glad that these songs are on rotation in my music collection. The music is overall good and the lyrics actually have meaning."
5,"A welcome addition to any personal, academic, or community library DVD collection.","""Ambient Space: The Best of NASA Photos, Volume 1"" offers an armchair journey into the vastness of space with spectacular images of galaxies, nebulae, the Solar System, Planet Earth, early scenes of NASA, space flight, the shuttle, and the Hubble Space Telescope, as well as other exotic sights and conceptual art. With a total running time of over two hours, ""Ambient Space"" is an upscale, technically flawless, video slideshow in a DVD format that incorporates Vat19's 'playlist' technology allowing the viewer to control the order of scenes and even the music for each individual scene selected - or viewers can just hit 'Play All' and enjoy the show. There's even the bonus of 'Desktop Wallpapers'. As engagingly entertaining as it is educationally informative, ""Ambient Space"" is the first of a planted series taken from NASA archives and a welcome addition to any personal, academic, or community library DVD collection."
1,Way way to expensive...,Apparently I didn't read the description completely.... One candle $14.00 is too expensive.. I will pay close attention the next time..
4,Pretty nice for a cheap bike,"I received my bike and set about assembling it. The first thing I noticed was that one spoke on the front wheel had gotten bent in transit. The bike assembles very easily with 1 size wrench and 2 sizes of Allen key.I have many of the same complaints as the other reviewers:-Derailleurs are off a little bit-Front brake needs some serious adjustment-Plastic shield on the crank gear is in the way-Seat does not adjust forward or back(though I didn't feel the need to tilt it while test riding it)-Braking position is awkwardThe above having been said, what do you expect out of a bike that costs anywhere between $90 and $145? This is your standard, run of the mill asian import bike. It needs adjusting, correcting and sometimes, the parts need replacing to work right.That is just what I expected when I made this purchase, and so far I'm satisfied."
3,Not as good as the first but vastly superior to the rest,"First off let me say that the original Predator movie is one of my favorite movies of all time. So this movie had little chance to blow my socks off. However, it was a pretty decent movie. The story kept me interested. It gave props to the first movie and all of the characters were at the very least decent."
2,Works ok but probably would try something else,"Works ok but there are a few nagging problems. Bought this product because I already have a router and wanted to drop wireless devices on my wired network. I have a toshiba laptop with a wireless G card built in and by the end of the day network throughput performance drops off by at least 50%. Tried various options and still haven't resolved. Also, the firmware for this product is not updated as often as the Wireless routers (latest is August of 2007), which makes me think this product is not used as much as the router and does not get the same level of support. Note the manual says it supports NTP but there is no NTP picks on the time menu. For the couple of months I've had this product I've had to reboot 4 times."
4,"Worth reading, but it'll take you a while...","Whoa! What a monster of a book! Even though it's a compelling novel this one really needs a strong edit since it's WAY too long, probably twice as long as it needs to be. As in Debt of Honor, there are some exciting moments and the concept of President Ryan is intriguing but muddling your way through the filler to reach those interesting moments can be exhausting. Also, the final scene is too reminiscent of a mediocre action film, the payoff doesn't equal what's been hammered out over the previous 1300 (! ) pgs. Ryan drops a bomb on the Iranian leader that started the biological war. The end. Abrupt and unsatisfying. Still, I find it to be much less confusing and easier to digest than DOH was."
4,easy&beautiful beaded small designs,"Beads add a beautiful new dimension to cross-stitch and this book makes it easy to do. It has around 100 very small designs: lots of hearts,flowers and baskets,cute little houses,angels,halloween and christmas ornaments. There are also around ten (a little bit larger)beautiful samplers. The charts are well defined with clear instructions. The designs are small but very charming and cute. I also used some of the designs for x-stitching without beads and the results were very pretty."
1,Not a character worth caring about,"A recent widow discovers her late husband had an illegitimate son.I've tried to read this before, with no more success than now. When the characters in a character-based book are one-dimensional and unlikable, there just isn't anything to keep me reading."
1,Serious Martial Artists- Don't waste your money!!!!!!!!!! Bullshido.,"I've just bought this book, opened it to find photos of ninjas and Western style medical diagrams... So I went online to do some research on hei long (the author) and his mysterious martial art ""lian shi""... there is literally nothing on the internet about this art, his own website has no instructor called ""hei long"". furthermore I found that there is a wikipedia article on Hong Kong comics - with a character called ""shi hei long"" ---notice the resemblance to the authors name and the art.[...]DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY."
4,great tool,"This is my 1st but NOT my last Palmgren tool. Fit and finish is very good. Instuction book is clear and easy to follow, tool works GREAT.4 stars only because even at max. depth the staples are just flush not counter sunk, even with 120# of air. The Soft case if Great, allows plenty of storage for extra boxes of staples and no broken plastic hinges. I have 2 othe 18 guage and 1 16 guage finish nailers so this will be dedicated to staples. At this point I would recommend this to everyone."
3,so-so,"I read the reviews for this item before I purchased it, but they were mixed. The supplier's service was excellent, but the product is a disappointment. I am not going to return it because it was relatively inexpensive and works ""well enough."" I do have problems with the retractable lines getting jammed, even though I am careful with it. This happened after I had only used the core twice. Also, even though it is a 20-foot cord, it seems much shorter because the cords come out of two separate openings (10 feet each)."
5,Pulp Fiction's cult and classic,"If you haven't seen this, you haven't seen nothing yet. Tarantino's best. Great ensemble cast, some crazy twists and vintage script. Buy this; essential video."
4,great fun,"Clear writing, rare in math / science books, shines throughout here. The final few chapters of this book are in `woo woo' land [which is 4 stars to zero side of Star Trek Voyager and on to infinity'] but this tome is a great read. It is not at all a math heavy work ... I suspect that a fair grip on 4th grade arithmetic would do it. Great for a `book report' for a kid who `hates math'."
1,Displeased,Product is top heavy and flips over whenever you make a basket. It needs to be weighted on the bottom.
5,AWESOME,THIS CD IS UNREAL I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. iT IS THE BEST OF THE BEST SONGS THAT TEMERARIOS HAS MADE. I AM AN AMERICAN AND I LOVE THE MUSIC THAT TEMERARIOS PLAYS EXPICALLY YA MI VOY PARA SIEMPRE
1,Black &Decker Gizmo Mixer,I have owened one for about 30 years.the first one lasted for 20years and the second one is still going strong. I bought one for my sister about 18 years ago the charging stand transformer went badlast august. So I got her a new one for Christmas. I use mine about 5 times a week.
5,The Prostate: A Guide for Men and the Women whoLove Them,"I was given this book prior to prostate surgery and it's now the only source of information to which I refer friends when asked about my experience with prostate cancer. It is well written, easy for the layman to understand, and very thoughtfully spells out the available options a prostate cancer patient faces. My wife also read the book, and it gave her a sense of understanding of my problem which she'd not had. Thanks Dr. Walsh."
3,At first I was excited...,I was really excited when I first purshased this book on Amazons website. The artwork I thought was a little too rough for a two year old. I like the idea but I didn't feel there was enough positive reinforcement in it. I showed it to mom who is Montessori Teacher and she disliked it. She wouldn't added it to her room collection. I would make sure you really reinforce that you still love your child even though they may do things we do not LOVE!
2,Part two's comming soon! Please be better than this one,"I Love Nikki Turner's writting style and have enjoyed her books...this was the weakest I have read so far. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed it and will be reading part2 to see how things end and all but, uh...let's just say if I would have read this book first? I probally wouldn't of read anything else from her unless it really caught my eye. Not a must read but a ok read for true Nikki Turner fans."
3,Insights of a senior acupuncturist:One combination of points,"I found Miriam Lee's book very interesting. As a student in a traditional chinese medicine institute I have a lot of books on points and acupuncture and many of them can be quite tedious for the beginning student. I found not only her stories interesting but the insights to treatment principles very helpful. I am about to finish my first year in school and some of the information I have already learned made more sense after reading her book. I intend to kept it and refer to it often. Not only was it very informative but an interesting read as well, as a matter of fact the day I came home and found it had arrived I became so interested in it that I stayed up late reading it and forgot to make dinner."
5,A Timeless Classic,"I remember seeing this movie as a child, and I was very impressed then, and I still am. I purchased the DVD because I remembered how much I enjoyed the movie as a child. When I watched it again, I appreciated it more because it was so important for its time. Racism and prejudice was rampant at the time this movie was made, in 1965. It speaks to the need for tolerance and justice back then, just as much as it does today. This was my first exposure to the talents of Sidney Poitier, and Shelly Winters won an Academy Award for her portrayal of the main character's abusive mother. I can't stress how touching and worthwhile this movie is. Watch it...I know you'll enjoy it as much as I did."
5,Comfort & Great Price,"I have foot problems and these are the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn! I would recommend a half size larger but other than that, they are perfect. I can walk on stones and you can't feel them through the sole. I scuff them daily working with small children and they clean up so well, they look brand new. I love them so much, I bought two new pair that are sitting in my closet waiting to be worn when this first pair wears out."
2,Gangster Story is awful. Beat the Devil is watchable.,"Walter Matthau said that his film ""Gangster Story"" was probably the worst film ever made. I think he was right. Terrible story, terrible acting, and it probably cost $ 50 to make. ""Beat the Devil"" is interesting to see, since it's a cult film. One bad feature - the synchronization of the speech is off - the actors speak, and you hear what they say with just a very slight delay. It's very slight, and it's not so bad that it ruins watching the film, but it IS a small irritant to see them speak and have the sound not match their lip movements. (The film didn't do much for me, but many people think it's great.)"
3,Not as good or innovative as the first album.,"I really liked slipknot's first album, really grinding guitars, somewhat complicated arrangements, and catchy lyrics. However this album has missed the mark. This album goes to fill the noisy rap-rock genre with drop tuned guitars, with whiny singing that eventually evolves into growling. They should have just stayed with the formula they had in the first album. I have a real bad feeling that they will end up like Korn and most of the other rap rockers, they all release a really good first album-a really tight arrangement, good melodies and songs- but then every follow up album is crap. If you want to hear some really good metalcore-the orgin of this genre which originated in the late 80's early 90', get some Anthrax(""persistence of time"") or Biohazard(""urban discipline"") which is real metal(no drop tuning or whiny growls). I guarantee you will not be disappointed with these two alternative suggestions."
1,Worse Than Paper and Pencil,Whatever you do... do not purchase this machine. You are spending [money] on a doorstop that gets less work done than paper and pencil. I have to say that this is absolutely the worst purchase I have ever made. The computer has a desktop processor which overheats and thus causes it to shut down unexpectedly. Even better is the fact that Toshiba released a patch which throttles the cpu to lower than 50%. So basically you are paying for a laptop that runs at 500 mhz and shuts down on you periodically. Toshiba will not refund your money and will only tell you to send it into their service depot for which they do not have a fix.
4,good read but not solid,"The problem with Super Massage Simple Techniques for Instant Relaxation is that it mentions sex just as much -if not more- than the actual massages that *should* be the main focus of the book. I mean there's already hundreds and thousands of sex books out there- I was more interested in the massage and relaxtion information which was mentioned enough, but nothing really plentiful or mind-blowingly original that I haven't already heard or figured out on my own. I dunno, it's not a bad read but you can probably find other books that focus entirely on the topic of massages."
3,Wished we knew more,"I wish we would have had more information all together.More about alaska, what happened that night, more in general"
4,Too short,"I liked this story, but it wasn't among my favorite Diana Wynne Jones books. I think that's because it was so short - a lot of things are left pretty vague, and while the concept is imaginative and creative with the best of them, I wished that there was more detail, to make this world more real. I guess I would call this story more ""clever"" than ""immersive,"" if that makes sense. So, 4 stars for an interesting story, anyway :)"
5,BRILLIANT,"You have to be in the mood to watch this think outta the box movie. If you have a open mind, you will see why the young girl deserved to be noticed by Oscar! I think I will my my new puppy Hushpuppy!Enjoy!"
1,Small and useless,I agree with the former reviewer. These cups are very small. The description of them being small wasn't there when I purchased them.They are soft cheesy plastic. Too small for a drink.I can't return them because it would cost almost as much as just keeping them. The seller wasn't very up front on how small and cheap looking these things are.Something you would find in a dollar store in the toy section for a buck.
4,Excellent for the professional,"Now that we all have laser printers and computers, we are offered 120 - 400 different fonts on even the most basic home computing set-ups. Many people are interested in knowing more about ""orthography"" (doing typography well). Bringhurst's book is thoroughly professional and quite readable. It's complete (it covers non-English characters in some depth) and encyclopedic, and in my judgment it is a standard of ""best practice.""However, this book is written at a level that would be appropriate for a serious graphic designer who is considering designing a new font. It's a bit beyond what a layman would need--or find interesting.Recommended, then, for professionals only."
2,Short term battery life,"I purchased this razor in September of 2005. In December of 2005 the blades were so dull, that it took forever to shave, and I certainly don't have a heavy beard. I am very disappointed with the short life of the blades. At this rate it would cost me $ 120.00 a year for blades. I am sorry to say that I would not purchase this item again, nor would I recommend it."
3,Mistaken Order,"It was our mistake, but we thought we were purchasing the much better boneless/skinless club sardines from Seasons, which are very good. These are not as good, although they are better than the cheaper branded sardines."
1,why is this game so BAD?,whoever wants to buy this game please dont. if you rent it thats fine but the game is lousy.once your done with the game you would never want to play it again.
3,Tough but hard,"These shoes look nice and seem to be very durable but the sides are a little too stiff, I hope that once I break them in they will be more comfortable."
5,works like promised,"Good, thick plastic with the same hinge as the original cover.I only wish that it came with the small slider clip that the original one uses. Sometimes they bend or wear out. But, that is not the fault of the company. they give a good description and fair price!"
4,Very practical gadget,"This is a very practical gadget to own, it makes the transfer of photos to any computer a breeze, you just connect it and it behaves in the same way as a USB memory. The only flaw in this gadget is the rubber cover,it's very loose and doesn't have a snug fit, therefore it's always open allowing dust in, that's the only reason why I gave it 4 stars. The very small size allows you to take the unit anywhere without any problems. The main advantage of this gadget is that you won't ever need the camera and cable to transfer photos to your computer, specially if you own several cameras that use different USB cables."
2,"I wanted to like this one, but...","I've yet to read anything by Garth Ennis other than Preacher that I liked very much, and this one was no exception. This might have made a pretty good one-shot comic book, but the rather thin premise is barely enough to sustain a short six-issue series. It's occasionally pretty funny, and I'm giving it two stars instead of one because it did make me laugh a few times, but otherwise, it seemed to me that there just wasn't much else there. A lot of the gags are very repetitive, and I got tired of the running gag about the rather limited vocabulary of the Rifle Brigade pretty quickly. I can accept that this is a comedy and not anything resembling a serious war comic, but I didn't think it delivered in that department.Fans of Garth Ennis may like this book, but people who mainly know him as the writer of Preacher (which even had a better Nazi villainess!) might be disappointed."
5,Perfect!,"This griddle is perfect in every way. It folds up to store easily yet is big enough to feed a crew. The plates snap in and out easily and are dishwasher safe. Very, very pleased and would recommend to all my friends."
5,"TINY CAMERA -- GREAT, BIG PICS'!!!!!!!!","This is my first experience with digital photography, so maybe I am missing something here, but WOW -- this little camera takes AWESOME pictures -- and this from a person who usually manages to jiggle the camera (OTHER cameras, anyway) just enough to make the picture come out blurry. But with THIS camera, one vacation and about 500 shots later, NOT ONE picture came out blurry because of my unsteadiness!!! And the simplicity of loading the pictures onto the computer -- even a computer neophyte like myself can do it. I recommend this camera to anyone who wants an excellent print from a simple to use (and just the right size to carry in your pocket) camera!!!"
1,Intelligence-insulting drivel.,"It's hard to believe all these great reviews. This show tries way too hard to develop a Northern Exposure-like cast of quirky characters. It also tries way too hard to convince you that everyone in town is a super-genius a la ""Real Genius"" with Val Kilmer. However, the real trouble starts when the entire town comes together and starts finishing each others' sentences - solving impossibly complicated problems with a few minutes of facile, preposterous techno-babble. It's enough to make me long for the plausibility of the worst episodes of Star Trek Voyager, if not a quick death. I wonder how Hollywood executives thought that writing a show about geniuses and mind-bending science at an elementary school level of sophistication would be a good idea... oh yeah, all those great reviews. Never mind."
5,Excelent coffee,These coffees are so good and can't be bought in any store. I bought it for my son and he just loves all the flavors.The price is right and with super saver delivery even better.
4,Quality Product,"This is just what it looks like and almost everything you want from a drinking bubbler. The chrome finish is perfect and the product seems very durable. So far, no leaks -- a big plus.I have only one minor gripe and that is about the adjustability of the water flow. It can be adjusted up or down but not down far enough to give that perfect arc of water you expect from a drinking bubbler. This makes for a jolly good time when unsuspecting users blast water on their face. :) It's possible that our water pressure is too strong for the fixture.I would still recommend the product."
1,People believe this?,"The minute I hit the part about the priest in Paris, I knew something smelled funny. Well, it was a tossup between that and the conveniant suicide of Lilly, just a few hours before Frey's release. If it were just the one incident, he'd get away with it, but taken all together the book gives off the odor of trying too hard. It all reads like your basic movie-of-the-week, except with more vomit."
4,the really brilliant record by these 3,"The previous record was heavily influenced by David Hentschel and was sonically inferior to this one, although material-wise DUKE and ABACAB are similar. With the new sounds that Collins and engineer Hugh Padgham found here (especially the insanely-compressed percussion) this album launches the band into the stratosphere. Easily my favourite title by them, all the session's outtakes and b-sides are also worth hunting down. ""Who Dunnit"" and ""Keep It Dark"" (the latter a UK 12"" single) are among the cleverest, best recorded that this band ever produced. It's a shame that susequently only the 5-track studio side of follow up 'Three Sides Live' came close to recapturing this magic. I loved this record enough back-in-the-day that I repurchased it for $17 on japanese vinyl, just to wring that last bit of fidelity out of my stereo. IMPRESSIVE!"
1,The only part that works is the rain gauge.,"I bought this for a home school unit for my 8-year-old about the weather, and was so disappointed! The only part of it that actually works is the rain gauge (so my only compliment is that that part does not leak)! The thermometer says it is always exactly 48 degrees, and the wind always blows north. If I hadn't spent so long assembling it and it weren't such a hassle, I'd send it back. Since I don't plan to, the next best way to make my point is to advise everyone else not to buy one!"
2,This album wasn't that good,"I didn't like this album that much. Only songs i liked are The MC, Step Into A World, A Friend, Can't Stop Won't Stop. Just To Prove A Point song was horrible and i don't know why he tried to do a rock song. Putting Puff Daddy on the Step Into A World remix was a terrible decision by KRS. The songs were too short on this album also."
4,Its real fun the disco way!!,"Its the 80s of Bollywood , so what do ya expect? Its melodrama, dance , music , fun all the way!The hero, seems to be the Michael Jackson of India & it shows in an utterly entertaining way.Just remember to keep aside any logic whatsoever , grab yer pop corn & soda ...enjoy all the way! Its hilarious(unintentionally) , has lots of dance , music and fun. Basically a revenge story of a kid whose father is brutally murdered and he grows up to avenge ; only as a disco dancer. This is similar to movies like DISCO DANCER, DANCE DANCE etc. but probably more entertaining."
3,Poor quality brush,"This item does what it says, i.e., plumps your lips, but unfortunately the brush that is used to apply it is of such poor quality that every time I use it, more and more of the brush strands come off and get stuck on my lips . . . not a fun task to remove them:-( For the price, I would have hoped that the manufacturer could have come up with a better brush."
1,"Philips, I am disappointed!","This stereo has been in a box since it broke almost a year ago. I have found Philips to be one of the worst electronics manufacteurs out there. Their products just don't last under normal use. Plus, they really do not stand behind their product. I am tired of making Amazon do all my leg work so I am just going to eat the costs on this one and let Philip's name get dragged through the mud. Shame on you Philips, shame on you!"
5,Gleason made this movie really shine,"There are lots of great things about this movie. Sally Field is irresistably cute, Burt Reynolds is charming, Jerry Reed and his dog are great sidekicks....but Sheriff Buford T. Justice and his boy bring a large amount of the laughs. I may be a little bit biased as Jackie Gleason is one of my favorite entertainers of all time, but he was great as the sheriff. Its a shame there were no more similar (or even different) roles like this for him. He was a great actor and had a talent for making people laugh."
4,Arkady Renko finds the rhythm of post-Russian Cuba.,"M.C. Smith is gifted writer who, through the eyes of Arkady Renko, an ill-fated Russian investigator, has shown us sable smuggling in the old Soviet Union (Gorky Park) and the floating Gulag aboard a Russian trawler (Polar Star). Renko introduced us to the Russian Mafia that filled the vacuum left by Soviet collapse (Red Square). Now Renko's back, revealing the dark rhythms of Cuban drums and the fetid aroma of socialist decay, Caribbean-style. In Havana Bay, Smith's careful crafting of the prose and his sharp insight into the Soviet world are several cuts above the magnetism of the plot, but you'll love the way he tells it."
2,G-Unit drops and... ehh,"Well, it's not a terrible cd, but its about 1/4th of what the Black Album is. Lloyd Banks proves he is truly the most innovative, and the best rapper in the group, and Buck basically flops out. He isn't tight at all. 50's verses are alrite, but nothing we haven't heard before. I personally can't wait for Yayo to get out of jail because his flow is siiick. Heres 1 vote for a Yayo, Banks group. 50 stay solo and find something new to rhyme about. And Buck please... just go away. Every1 go buy Jay-z's final effort ""The Black Album"" its a true classic, and the last album from the best living rapper in the world"
3,From What I Saw Of It...,"..""Grease 2"" was not that bad. I didn't see the whole thing, but I saw about half of it on tv. It doesn't hold a candle to the first film, but it has some good things goign for it. The plot is paper thin. The performances are pretty stiff (Michelle Pfeiffer, my favorite actress after Ann-Margret, has done much better), but the songs were catchy and the film was overall watchable. I'd recommend it."
3,razor barracuda 5.1 headphones,"Most uncomfortable headphones I have ever owned.My ears hit the inside where the speakers are, as the padding is not thick enough. These are the same as turtlebeach Ear Force HPA2. Sound is good, but not as good in surround as the zalmans I wore out. The bass is great, and they vibrate if enough bass is there."
2,"All the elements, but poor execution","With an action cast as magnificent as they had in this film, and obviously high budget, there is literally no excuse why every scene shouldn't kick major ass and leave you totally satisfied. Unfortunately the opposite happened-- Every scene seemed to zoom by, without any truly ""cinematic"" moments that are memorable. Every amazing introduction of each new character was less than lackluster, and the action wasn't anything that we haven't seen before.To have Jean Claude VanDamme as the bad guy was the coolest thing ever, and the actual movie failed to live up to that premise.As a side note, I'm also really tired of looking at CG blood explosions. It looks fake, it's always over the top, and never adds to the scene. The action giants in this film came up in an era of real pyrotechnics and squibs, and the action in those films is still better."
1,"Save your money, buy another vacuum!","For the price of this vacuum, I wasn't expecting much, despite the good reviews and consumer report's recommendation. However, I was pleasantly surprised. This vacuum had great suction, is easy to maneuver, does not weigh too much, and is very affordable. However, it works MUCH better on carpet than bare floors. It does pick up small particles and leaves on our linoleum kitchen floor, but does not pick up cat litter-it spits it backwards at you. I have to sweep the kitchen/utility room before I vacuum it. Besides this inconvenience, I would highly recommend this vacuum.UPDATE 1/2011: One month after writing this review, we took this vacuum to the dump one month after this review. The cord split in half lengthwise, and the suction stopped completely. Don't waste your money on this piece of junk!!"
5,*NOT AS GOOD AS DEVIL'S EMBRACE BUT STILL A *5*,"As I said with ""Devil's Embrace"", people should lighten up. In those years in history, most men were barbarians. They for the most part treated women light trash, no better than dogs. In fact, they treated their pets better than they did their women. If you are a historical romance reader, you take this in stride as the way things were then.I found this book to be very ""INTENSE"" and hated to have to put it down to do other things. As one reviewer stated, would have been nice to have Adam & Arabella to have their own stories, but it worked out fine this way, as Adam came to rescue Arabella with Rayna. The way she had the children of the main characters of ""Devil's Embrace"" come together was wonderful. Truly enjoyed it."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I bought this bottle warmer at Target (the only travel style warmer they had) and it is awful. I will boil bottles before leaving the house and place inside this bottle warmer. After about 1.5-2 hours, they are room temp again. It will not warm a cool bottle at all. I am currently shopping for another."
5,The secret weapon in the World's Best Barbecue Shrimp.,"Mine!OK, so now you know my secret so I might as well tell you that anchovy paste is alsocritical. Send me some royalties awright!I have to laugh at the negative reviews for this wondermous stuff, you're not supposedto eat it with a spoon, its a concentrate you nimrods! Sheesh.I also use this in gumbos, and recently tried it in some homemade vegetable soup and guesswhat.... it was GREAT!!! Very versatile, I can imagine any number of uses.Better Than Bouillon has a great product line, and this is the Flagship. No kitchen shouldbe without a jar of this, and it lasts a long long time in the fridge. Seriously, whats tocomplain about?"
1,My2Cents,"Please do not waste your time on this book. This book is a mish mash of topics ranging from requirements gathering to managing projects with use cases thrown in between. If you are newbie, this book is not for you. It does not teach you either UML or how to apply use cases. Martin Fowler's ""UML Distilled"" is better than this book in many aspects"
2,WRONG FORMAT,"WON'T PLAY ON MY CD PLAYER & WHEN I EMAILED THE DUDE HE SAID I WAS A NUT. I""M LIKE, WTF MAN EVERYONE ALWAYS SAYS THAT EVEN GRANDMA & MR CHRISTIE FROM UP THE STREET WHO LOOKS OVER THE FENCE BUT IT CAME WITH A PRETTY COOL SHIRT"
1,Typical Korean Soap Opera Formula,"If you're familiar with Korean soap opera, then you already know the plot, the characters and the ending. It's a textbook K soap formula, but it may be entertaining for those who aren't familiar with the formula."
3,Useful but limited foldout guide.,"This is a useful guide for identifying common birds in Tennessee. However, it includes only the drawings and sizes. I use mind to hand to friends when I am birding; it keeps them out of my Peterson's and Audubon guides."
2,Cuisinart has made better products,"The device isn't stable. Also, the motor lags when you really get that orange in there. And I always make a mess, which breaks my heart because that's juice lost, which takes so long to squeeze. I bought this a year ago and now I""m looking to buy one of the old-fashioned hand press."
4,Catbox review,This litterbox works great and is very quiet. My only problem with it is its size. Bigger than I had expected and does not fit into the place I wanted to put it. Other than that it is great. I have two cats and they had no problem adjusting to the box. I change the litter after every 60 or 70 uses. which is about every 3 weeks.
2,Tedious at best,"For one, this book was a free download. I would have been upset if I had to pay for this book. It started out interesting where you get to learn about the strength of Anne's character as she confront's a band of Niall's men. They also learn from one another when he is taken prisoner and she tends to his wounds. Unfortunately, the book goes downhill from here. There were so many frustrating moments when they were quarrelling due to misunderstandings. Niall is literally as Anne calls him a ""pigheaded dolt."" Part way through the book, I was hoping Niall would come to a bad end so Anne would run off with Ian. But the most frustrating part of the book was the constant preachiness. Was I the only one who missed that this was supposed to be Christian lit? For one, I've read several levels with Scottish Highlanders and I'm not sure if the references to ""Christians"" and ""Jesus"" were appropriate. Weren't they supposed to be Catholic... Any way, I won't be reading else from this author."
5,Excellent,"The inside man is modern but has what was great about the golden era of movies. Essentially a really clever bank robbery plot, it has a moral peice behind the motivation for the crime and a sense of justice to the whole thing. The cast is tremendous including Clive Owen, Denzeil Washington and Jodie Foster who all performed up to their reputations. This is a great entertainment experience, there is nothing trendy, nothing weird just a really clever story told by a great story teller in Spike Lee.This is a film well worth seeing"
5,Home... is Where the Heart is,"This album is beautifully done. For those Gathering fans who enjoyed the smooth and melodic sounds of Souvenirs and If-Then-Else, this one will be a great addition. All of the Gathering albums are fantastic in their experimentation of genre, poignant song messages, and the hypnotizing vocals of Anneke. This album is experimental in the ambient sense. There is not much aggressive guitar work but rather a lot of serene vocals by Anneke and alternative/electronic progression by the band. Its a great creative effort that shows the many colors and talents of this group."
2,One major problem,"I didn't really have a problem with this printer until I started printing pictures with a lot of black in them. There seems to be a lot of faded stripes across each picture that can't be eliminated with a nozzle clean. Since I've started to print more dark pictures with black in them, this printer is basically worthless to me. I'm currently looking for a different printer."
5,"Aim for the Heart is a first-rate ""How-To "" for TV journalists","Al Tompkins scores with a practical guide to make pictures and words compelling, even for a novice TV reporter."
1,DON'T BUY WILL NOT WORK,Hooked up the item like it said to it will not work tried it on three receivers did not work
2,Kinda sucked,"I read the reviews on this movie and thought that it would be pretty good, so I bought it and was I wrong. This movie sucked, I understand that it's a spoof movie and was supposed to be funny not scary but it wasn't even funny. RETURN TO HORROR HIGH is better, it's funnier and the deaths are better. I don't even understand how the BREATHER was killing people with an eggplant and where did it come from? Did he bring it with him? The paper clip was kinda funny but not really and the death scenes were over fast and you really don't see anything. The BREATHER kept stepping in gum and saying CLICK when he was on the phone with people-again NOT FUNNY, I usually really enjoy these types of movies because I do love scary movies so much but this movie just didn't do it for me and I am a little upset that I spent $[...] bucks on this. Unless you like senseless horror spoofs then don't waste your money on this film."
4,Great Clarity but no Boom,I've had them now for over 3 weeks and I must say they sound great. The clarity of the highs and mids is impressive if kept at a reasonable volume. They are however lacking in bass and start to sound distorted at higher volumes. They were mounted in the corners of my deck which is 9 feet above ground. A second set may be needed for the ground level when I have a party or cookout.
4,Really works!,"These traps really work. They surely catch fleas, however, they will not resolve a flea infestation. This requires other products. But the traps are excellent to measure the grade of infestation and to determine in which areas of the house there is an actual problem. This product does not seem to be intended for anything else. Also, these traps do not work by light but through the heat the lamp creates. Thereby, it emulates the warmth of a body. So, if a trap is placed in a well-heated room or next to an animal, it will not work particularly well."
1,Ideology,"This book promotes the internalization of a Protestant work ethic, which is perhaps what readers may indeed desire. Fiore has some interesting insights into the psychology of the chronic procrastinator, but I found the book's ideology too much to swallow:""We all have a number of things we would like to accomplish, things we tell ourselves we 'should' accomplish -- increasing our net profits, learning to play the piano, making a million dollars, taking a vacation, writing a book, finishing a degree, repairing the house, losing ten pounds, spending more time with friends, getting up earlier..."" --- how much more bourgeois can this book get?Procrastinators, you are more than producers!! No matter how ""fun"" efficiency can be, life is more than setting and meeting goals."
1,OK I giggled....,TWICE in the whole book. It is a cute book but not really funny nor usefull in anyway...unless your 18 then you might get away with some of the stunts in here. I think I found 3 fairly good tips other than that I was done with the book in under an hour and can't wait to get rid of it.
2,Last of their great era,"This was clearly a time when the band was heading in the ""break up"" period. The albums before this one though, were perhaps some of the greatest Rock ever written. I still do not feel that SMITH got the credit that band's such as Zeplin, Van Halen, kiss etc., recieved. And if there was a better lineup of pure get in your soul rocker's, than Aerosmith, I've never heard it. They clearly stand up to any Rock Band I have ever heard."
1,Junk,Yes it is a magnifier. But the plastic literally broke taking it out of the box. I know a lot of reviewer exaggerate when they don't like something. But this thing truly did break right away. It is way overpriced for the quality.
4,Hagiography at its most entertaining!,"Just as Will Rogers never met a man he didn't like, W.C. Fields has not yet met a biographer who could faithfully reveal this extraordinary life. This book, the very first biography by a gifted writer and close crony and idolator of Fields, stands up as a very entertaining, fun read. No pretense is made of its veracity, and the author revels in passing along as truth the many legends, embellishments, half-truths, fictions, conceits, misdirections and heresies propagated and condoned by Fields himself during a lifetime of playing anyone but his true extremely complicated self to the outside world. His close friends, Taylor included, gleefully abetted this cover-up, and his book continues the conspiracy. With that ton of salt, it remains immensely entertaining and worthwhile reading!"
3,MP3 Download missing a track,"I'm lowering the rating for this album for the sole reason that the CD version comes with 17 tracks (Kid Rock duet being track 11). On the MP3 download album, that track is mysteriously missing. Not even listed in the track listing. Of course I didn't realize that until AFTER I downloaded. Sneaky and not fair to the consumer."
2,Disappointing,"I enjoyed The Girls Guide to Hunting and Fishing and I was looking forward to this book, but I was very disappointed with The Wonder Spot. The first thing I noticed was she used the words ""I said"", ""he said"" ""she said"" FAR FAR too often. Perhaps this was a creative choice, to use only the word ""said"" over and over and over again, but it came incredibly repetitive, particularly on the audiobook version. If this was a creative choice, it did not seem a very successful one. In addition, I found the main character entirely without any redeeming quality. She whined and complained constantly about her life, but did little to try to improve it and made just stupid, uninspired life choices repeatedly. I have little patience with that sort of thing and don't find it enjoyable to read about a woman with no direction. Overall, I was very disappointed and with the vast amount of books available in this genre, I doubt I read anything further from Ms. Bank."
5,Harry Potter Quidditch Goggles,"Very excited about these goggles! All we could find were swimming goggles, but we needed something to look like Amelia Earnhart's gear. This worked great! The adjustable strap let it be worn by a child or an adult. The padding around the eyes made it much more durable than I expected. The price made this an especially good find. With the Amazon Prime overnight shipping for $3.99, we got it in time for our classes. Can't say enough about how happy we are with this product for what we needed and the speed and ease of ordering and shipping."
2,Bad Publishing Regardless of Material,"The publisher took the text of Charles Haanel and squashed as much of it as possible on each page. The margins are small, and the text is squished upon each other making it very hard to read. This layout and publishing is cheap. This is unfortunate because the material is phenomenal.I recommend the material.I DON'T recommend this book from this publisher."
2,No para todo estilo,"No es mi estilo, sin embargo hay que aceptar que el tiene buena voz, seria genial si fuera mas original."
2,twice as expensive as regular coffee,"I bought the toddy and am now going to return it.The coffee tastes good but the amount produced per pound of beans is so small the cost becomes very high: following directions exactly I produce 4 cups of concentrate from 7 cups of water, per 3/4 pounds of ground coffee beans. after diluting these 4 cups of concentrate 3:1 with water as instructed, the final yield is 16 cups of coffee per 3/4 pounds, or 20 cups per pound. Based on Googling the question, hot brewed coffee yields approximately 40 cups per pound. Thus, it is exactly twice as expensive to use the toddy as to make hot coffee and cool it. To me that's too much of a premium.Also, the time/energy required brewing Toddy coffee versus traditional coffee is at least 2 to 1. Here again, it's just not worth it.Finally, the cleanup is a pain.While I appreciate the product I'm returning mine"
3,disappointing,"True, this book has almost every imaginable word you would need if visiting Russia or trying to communicate with your new child from Russia BUT it does NOT have any pronounciation help. Every word is written, well, in the Russian alphabet. So unless you can read Russian letters and pronounce them, this book is really no help."
5,Bunn Coffee Pot,"Excellent service, fast, prompt and item was economically priced. Would order again from this store."
4,Basic and Useful,"Very useful in formulating educational strategies for your bright child, with one exception. A good portion of the book discusses identification of the gifted child. Most of the rest of it is organized around choosing the best public or private schooling for your child. What are your options? Which ones work best? What are the strengths and weaknesses of each method? It does not address how to help your gifted child if you have chosen to homeschool, which is what many parents of bright children want to know."
5,An Absolute MUST read for parents and teachers,This is the most important book on the social jungle that I have seen. I have taught school for 20 years and have a 14 year old daughter and a 10 year old son... I have read lots of books. This one should be required reading for teachers. The crises that are occurring in schools today can absolutely be traced to the clique behavior described in this book. It's time to open our eyes and recognize what is going on. This book gets the point across and gets started on doing something about it.
1,What a disappointment,This book is absolute garbage!The whole book is a tutorial with a lot of example problems for the user to solve. That's great!! The problem is when they LEAVE OUT very important measurements for you to complete the examples. So I've spent hours and hours working on one and now I can't finish it because they've FAILED to inlcude some very key data. Good job Thomson Learning!! You've successfully pushed yet another incomplete book out the door without so much as a decent proof read. Unbelieveable!!
3,Good,"i like the watch, its not great looking but is durable and fulfills the purpose of a sports watch which is why i bought it in the first Place. overall a good buy."
3,Inflates almost,"I own an INTEX inflatable boat so wanted to use this pump.Pump can only inflate half way one of the boats' chaimbers (total 3). Then I think pressure in the chaimber is more then the pump can produce so I have finish up the work by hand.Well it saves me some work.Pump is small so that's a plus at least.If I read the manual correct, you can only charge the battery of the pump using AC adapter not using DC adapter."
3,Funai FDRV90E Dual-Deck DVD/VHS Player/Recorder,The machine works well - while the remote control is difficult to read - to long and to many buttons...
2,"Great for a while, but then it's toast",Ive had the same problem posted by others... worked great for 6mos or so but now it's toast and only works intermittently.
5,Seat Covers,"I installed matching front and rear seat covers. Installation was very simple, can be done by one person. I have a boxer who rides with me on them all the time. They are durable and look great! Very pleased with how they really clean up the interior."
1,good when it lasts,It was good when it worked. But it only lasted for less than two weeks. The motor died when it was beating cake batter.
2,Tool Bits Fall Out,"I have not used the actual tools yet, but I was disappointed as the plastic case does not hold all the bits in place securely. Every time you close it, 3-4 items fall out of place. They should have spent more time designing the case. Also, the case does not lock securely. I am sure the tools will work fine."
5,Great camera,"I upgraded from a run-of-the-mill 35mm camera. I love this camera!! It's easy to use, lightweight, and a very nice design. My purchase (from dell.com) came with the charger, batteries a memory stick and the computer/TV hookup cable. This camera is very, very easy to use. Recommended for first time digital camera users."
5,White Plastic Kitchen Bowl Set is amazing!,"I truly love cooking with these bowls. The surface makes clean-up easy and the depth allows for me to throw an unlimited amount of concoctions into it. These bowls and strong and sturdy so that they will last forever and take all the wear and tear of cooking and the dishwasher. Overall, I'm very impressed with this product."
3,Item not received.,I have not received this item yet. It is on back order. I had to rate it so put 3 stars. However sicne it hasn't been received I can't really rate it. You ought to take situations like this into consideration if you're going to do this sort of thing.
2,Overly simplistic..,"Barber's analysis ignores important facts in order to prove his thesis about how the primary battle in the world being between the free market and religious fundamentalism. It works, somewhat, but fails to take into account numerous instances where this tension is called into question. Not every zealot in the world is an enemy of technology, as the War in Iraq has shown us."
4,It's a sword,I was looking for a small easy to carry sword for a B.O.B. This fit the bill. Fairly strong blade & sharp. I would have liked a better grip on it. The weave mesh it has moves a bit when you use it. I will probably change that out. Overall can't beat it for the price.
3,Weird,"The financier seemed too immature, but so did his girlfriend. The dad seemed like his temper was too hot for anyone who survives for a living. The death scenes were more grisly than I expected. Between the characters there was this bipolar action going on: ""I can't do this!"" ... ""Yes, you can! I love you."" ... ""OK, I can! Onward!""Really, it was weird.Weird I tell ya."
5,stays put!,got this for my 9 month old and we love it. the uv protection and adjustable sizing are great. the brim is nice and wide too. just perfect.
4,Much longer life spand than the so called improve nickle metal,Please dont wast time withe new makita batteries until they improve the life spend
2,"Fun toy??? Yeah, right!","Bought this toy and returned it the next day. First of all it comes with LOTS of screws, annoying bee and not sturdy at all. After I put it together it fell on my daughter's head! Looks real nice in the picture, but once you open it you'll probably regret buying it. All you have to do is lightly touch the mailbox and it will tip over. So, the stand doesn't hold the mailbox, which is not light by the way,you need a drill gun to put it together(tried the screw driver and it took forever to screw in 1 screw) and the bee has a vibrating sound that after 5 min of hearing it you want to throw the whole thing out the window. It is not worth the money or the effort."
5,Wow ! Garwood delivers another great story!,"I have just finished reading this wonderful book by Julie Garwood. I first got hooked on her after reading the stories of the Clayborne family (starting with For the Roses... that was made into a made for TV Movie, ""Rose Hill"". Then came the trilogy, and finally ""Come the Spring"", Cole's story, a personal Favorite!) When You read one of her books you instantly fall in love with her characters, and can't put it down. WARNING! Once you read one of her books you'll be hooked for life... I've never been disappointed with her writing, and am looking forward to reading many more. The Prize was an ""edge of your seat"" kind of read. I even found myself laughing at the end of one of the early Chapters, you'll have to read it to find out why :) This is a great book! ENJOY :)"
2,"EMPTY CALORIES! Read Tolkien, he says more with less.","This had a simple magic to it which I really appreciated. Yet the series is over 7,000 pages long. That is hundreds of thousands of words. Read The Lord of the Rings (LOR) instead. Its not even 2000 pages, a remarkable story, and best of all, you'll remember the beginning, end and everything between. It is a memorable work and you'll appreciate the long history developed in LOR. Should you want to read more, The Simillarion tells the early times of LOR's world."
2,A Traditional and Misleading Book,"This book is an excellent choice for parents who wish to indoctrinate their children with the traditional and misleading interpretation of the First Thanksgiving. This happy-go-lucky account makes it seem as though the Pilgrims believed in religious freedom, when in fact the only religious freedom they came to protect was their own. All other interpretations of God, they believed, were false, and should be corrected. This book also marginalizes the importance of the Natives who ensured the survival of those who would eventually destroy them.This book is also an excellent choice for history teachers who wish to give examples of how children are purposefully given false impressions by adults, especially with regards to America's history. I'm buying a copy for this specific purpose."
3,Too much money.,For the price you pay it really is just another plastic toy.. sure it squirts water but kids will move on to the next thing quickly.
4,Harry Potter and the order...,I have not read this yet. I had seen some of the movies and loved them. It was decided by my daughter that I should read them all first. I am reading the first one now and love it.
5,Amazing Machine,This machine really works! Perfect espresso every time and the steamer foams milk better than I expected. Would buy this machine again.
3,Fleischman tried too hard to write a good story.,"I started this novel yesterday evening and decided to skim through the rest of it after one hour of intense reading. It utterly failed to engage me because I was constantly annoyed with the author's attempts to incorporate every possible life lesson at the end of each paragraph!!! While I applaud Fleischman's effort to bring forth another perspective of a China of the early 20th century, her prose does not flow smoothly and her plot tends to ignore the rules of a plausible timeline (e.g. her character ages eight years after two paragraphs!). As a result, her heroine, Jade Virtue, is disappointingly unconvincing as a possible historical figure. Overall, Fleischman should have spent more time tuning her plot than inserting superfluous adjectives into each sentence."
1,Nudity Gets Airbrushed!!!!,"If you loved seeing Simon Callow and those two other guys naked in the 1980s version, you will be deceived here. Though they recreate the same, they airbrush out the male nudity. E. M. Forster must be rolling in his grave at this! If you want to see man action, see Forster's ""Maurice"" instead. Trust me: you don't want to sit through this boring, stuff, bourgie work and not get its famous reward at the end. It's one thing to airbrus something on public TV, but why do it on a DVD that's going to be watched in one's private residence? This is ridiculous as the nudity here is technically done in a non-sexual setting and fashion."
2,not Senco's fault,"Received box of staples loose in larger box with piece of unattached wrapping material floating around in there. Staple box was open, several clips of staples missing. Really, Amazon? The 2 stars are for Amazon, not Senco."
2,Predictable and not particularly funny,Not a movie I would watch a second time. A few funny moments but overall boring. Not a feel good holiday movie.
5,Packs a punch. This is a rare and complete book that reads like a text. A must have if interested in Brazil in any form.,"Only the highest mark for this outstanding work. If you're interested in Brazil, this is the book you want. Thank you Joeseph Page for this fantastic novel that could easily qualify as a sociological journal. This is without a doubt my favorite book in years."
1,Horrible Book - Dont waste your time or money,"I am an architect and certified Feng Shui specialist. This book is horrible. It recklessly confuses true Feng Shui with superstition. Please, using bagua mirrors to shield away the bad feng shui? Are you kidding me? The author even calls them pa-kua mirrors... This is the worst rendition of a feng shui book I have ever read. Give me a break, the author's other books are on ""psychic subjects"".Dont waste your money on this trash."
3,Depends on whether it works.,"I have had three of these ear pieces. It fits my ear well, is comfortable for long conversations (up to an hour or two), and stays put on my ear without hassle.The first one I had worked excellently for years before I got rid of it when I got rid of my cell phone. When I got a cell phone again, I knew exactly what I wanted. The second was just as great as the first, but unfortunately was stolen.The third didn't work. Booo. I could hear the person on the other end of the phone, but they could not hear me. I tried it on several different phones with the same result. Didn't work.I returned the ear piece and the seller was prompt and courteous. Too bad I got a defective item. But I guess that's how it goes with consumer electronics. I wouldn't let it stop me from ordering this again, though. Just make sure you get it from a decent seller who will accept a return if it doesn't work."
4,IT DOES THE JOB!!!!,"LOOK VERY NICE AND SUPPORTS EVEN A 235 POUND PERSON LIKE ME, THE ONLY THING I DON'T LIKE IS THAT WHEN THE SEAT IS ELEVATED TO THE MAX AND U PICK IT UP BY THE ROD, THE GREASE FROM CYLINDER COMES OUT JUST A BIT AND GETS YOUR HAND ALL GREASY , BUT NEXT TIME JUST PICK IT UP FROM ANOTHER POINT, WOULD DEFINITIVELY RECOMMEND IT !!!"
3,entertaining,"I enjoyed the movie, and was surprised at the end. Very different, romance type story. The acting was exceptional, I will watch it again."
3,"Good Tuneage, but more like a radio listen of the movie.....","I have mixed feelings about this CD. I love Queen's music, and I loved the movie, even if it was a little hokey in places. So I really, really wanted to love this CD. Well, the music is still great, but it was as if they simply ripped the music while it was playing in key sequences of the movie, and kept the spoken lines from whatever character was speaking at the time. If they could have removed the spoken lines, it would have been much better. However, if you did like the music and the movie, it is worth a purchase. Shame they don't redo it though, this time sans the spoken lines."
3,"Rousing good story, but...","I should have read the other customer reviews a little closer. What they said about the story and the writing are spot-on! However, as a Christian I was uncomfortable reading about a gay relationship. Even though I also bought ""The Fall of Kings"" I didn't read it. Both books went into my give-away box."
1,Not the one,"50 is trying to diss Nas (the lyrical God)? Please, thats like Bart Simpson fighting the Incredible Hulk! 50 cent is a maggot!"
2,disappointing,"I was disappointed in the book. I don't like the fact that DYED REDHEADS are portrayed as ""Redheads"". I am a natural redhead, I have a son, a daughter and a grandson who are all natural redheads, and we definitely don't look like we dye our hair. By the way, the Judds are definitely natural brunettes. Just look at some old photos or videos! Some things were interesting, the folklore, history and old stories, but overall the book was a disappointment. As one of the other reviewers said, ""science can't duplicate what nature perfected"". She's right!"
2,This book didn't survive the trials of time,"I ordered this book because I remembered enjoying the entire quartet when it first came out. However, I must say, that I didn't manage to get through the first half of volume one this time around. I found it very tedious and, though I kept trying to read further, it didn't seem to get any better."
3,"its ok, nothing that great","Just bought this for the cold i get every year in the winter. after trying many from retail stores, wanted to give this a try.. i was bit disappointed that only like 2oz of water can be filled. also note that you can not add any liquid vicks to hot water. you have to use some sort of pads. i am sure it is expensive."
5,Gorgeous vitriol from David Cross,"If you've never seen Mr. Show, buy the DVD now. I mean, stop reading this review and type Mr. Show into the search box.This CD is spit-milk-through-your-nose funny. Cross's targets are rednecks, George W. Bush, and [more] but his real hatred is reserved for stupidity in all its myriad forms, eg: putting an American flag on your Lexus SUV.My favorite quote so far is on the support for GWB after 9/11. ""We treat him like he just won third place in the Special Olympics. Good boy, George!"""
1,poor design and poor quality,"As the retired CEO of an engineering company, I concluded that this coffee maker's design and quality were poor. We threw it in the trash and bought another brand."
5,Well worth it,I always did like this movie. Too bad none of these old classics were never released by the original studios. But I'd recommend this one.
3,staircase of 1K steps: well....,"staircase of 1K steps: well, what can i say about this book? it was okay. perhaps its me, but i found the story a bit hard to follow (maybe from the cast of characters constantly being introduced without any background explanation of who they are). i also found my mind wandering quite a bit throughout the book. on the other hand, i enjoyed reading about an middle east culture and the storyline was good (once i got the idea where the story was going). overall, staircase is okay."
3,"It works, mostly.","The action jacket works fine overall. I really like the clip, it clips securely to your pocket/waist/shoulder strap. It is good that the clip works so well because the armband was a disappointment. It is awkward and too big to fit my arm comfortably. The band is almost as wide as the player is long and to fit my (average to small, female) arm it needs to be almost doubled so it ends up being bulky and fiddly. The jacket itself works OK but I was hopping for a better fit. For something made especially for this player I expected it to line up better with the buttons and be more fitted. I would get this product again because it does protect my player and allows me to clip it on to work out but only because there is no other case made for the Sansa c240 mp3 player."
2,Waste of money,"I purchased this cd based on all the positive reviews I had heard of it. I had never actually heard the band. Unfortunately, this seems to have been a bad idea. This cd is really quite unimpressive. The singer's voice is terrible. He does sing some interesting melodies but they end up sounding like crap because of his voice; like some anonymous alt-rock band. The music is slightly more complex than a lot of stuff out there, but so is ELP and I don't buy their cd's. If you want interesting music that is worth listening to then buy The Mars Volta's Deloused in the Comatorium or Tool's Aenema."
1,It Can Burn the house down,"I purchased this heater and one day - thankfully while I was near it - it started to hiss and spew out smoke, lots of black smoke, burning the innards and generating the awful smell of burning wires. Geez. This is not a safe heater as it could have burned down my house if I wasn't sitting in the room watching it meltdown."
5,Easily one of the most inspirational books ever written.,This book packs into a few short pages a plethora of universal truths. It is a simply written tale of the nature of purpose and of perfection. Its a story of freedom and thought and immortality that ought to inspire even the most stubborn pessimists and nay-sayers.
5,Great Vacuum!,"This is the first vacuum I have ever spent my own money on. I am replacing my old Phantom that my mother had handed down to me.I must say, everything I have read in all the reviews was dead-on. This vacuum really REALLY works well, lets virtually NO dust of any sort up into the air, is relatively quiet for such an inexpensive machine, and cleans the carpet very well.The first time I used it the bag was filled approximately 1/3 of the way, and I don't have a very big home. I probably vacuumed less than 800 square feet. That means it REALLY cleaned the carpet well.The belt does seem rather thin so if you suck stuff up it probably would break easily. Solution: don't take chances, don't suck up the curtains or a sock.The valve on top that changes from floor to hose suction works great. I have a huge shop vac and the suction from the hose on the smartvac is actually quite competitive with the Powerful shop vac.Great buy, I'm glad I chose it!"
4,Good,"One of the best concert films of the year. I watched it with my mom and she even liked it. It shows alot of backstage scenes that (normal) people rarely ever see. The only disapointment was that the ""live"" songs were obviously dubbed, and during the interview sequences, Mr. Manson's voice was distorted. But other than those little pet peeves, it was a great video worth every penny. The shots of the live performance were so close that you'd have to be a band member to get that close. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes Manson. END"
4,Sunrise Tai Chi,"I'm new to Tai Chi so didn't know just what to expect from a DVD of the subject but I'm pleased with Sunrise Tai Chi (YMAA). It will take some time to learn all the ""moves"" but feel confident that the instructional part of the DVD will teach me. I purchased Gentle Tai Chi at the same time. I have reviewed that separately."
5,The most creative and versatile word game I have played,Everyone at our house is looking for the dictionary to help find the best word to use the cards we have been dealt or have drawn. Because it is always challenging (and to avoid disputes) we would recommend the Scrabble Dictionary or a good pocket dictionary as a traveling companion to Quiddler.The progressive play of the cards (from 3 to 10 cards) changes the dynamics as you begin each round of play and creates new challenges each turn. Perhaps our family is not as competitive as some but we enjoy helping each player optimize the letters (cards) s/he is caught with after the first player goes down. We can all join in finding the best combinaton of words from each players hand to give him/her the best score with the available cards. It is interesting how many options can be found with the same set of letters... very educational and a lot of fun.I like the solitaire version also... if I have no-one else to play with.
1,New ones are not working like the old ones did,"I also have the same experience, new ones don't work at all. I also heard that they are really bad for you. Do some research about this and get your money back.Update, I got a ""bad bach and contact their co. they sent me an envelope to return them, I went ahead and purchase a second bottle from Amazon, first one was from Walmart online, so this second one is also not working. You know Alli works when you see the oily discharge when you go to the restroom. Apparently after been off the market for a while, they came back with a NON WORKING PRODUCT, I am sad SINCE i DID LOSE weigh THE FIRST TIME i TRIED THEM A FEW YEARS BACK."
5,"Good movie, good soundtrack","...I thought Eight Crazy Nights was great. It wasn't filled with potty humor, and the songs are pretty funny. My two favorite songs would definitely Bum Biddy and Long Ago."
1,One Of The Worst Jazz DVDs Imaginable,"First of all, look at the front cover of this DVD. My first impression by just looking at the front cover that Pat Metheny was going to be featured throughout the concert, but alas, he only appeared on two songs and two awful songs they were. Terrible, absolutely terrible. Second of all, who filmed this concert? A 17 year old high school kid? Totally unprofessional looking and lacking any kind of character. Lastly, the caliber of musicians who appeared on this film is truly disappointing. I mean these performances sound like college performers...in fact I've heard many college jazz musicians that sound better than these guys sounded.Don't waste your time or money on this DVD. The only way I would recommend this DVD is if you're a Metheny collector. Other than that, don't even bother with this one."
2,Don't like it anymore...,"This little thing was good for awhile, but then the stand broke. AND it started crashing my computer... Not just one, both of my computers. I had to use system restore just to get my computers working again. I'm not sure if its the monitor, or the displaylink driver. Either way, I don't like this monitor anymore. It was pretty good before it started crashing my computers. You'd be better off finding a different mini monitor though. And it just seems so cheaply made... The only use I would have for this now is for my laptop. I remember it not crashing my laptop a while ago. But still, I'm a bit afraid to plug it in to that too... :/"
4,A New Voice in Literature,"The strength of work can be found in the narrative The story capatures the reader and brings them into close proximity of each character. Further the authors voice is clear and profoundly inspired by the condotion of the free african-amercian, the educated african-amercian and their continued struggle for identity. The writer brings us into the condition of African Americans after the civil rights movement.I found the story moving in its telling and even with the errors a since clarity manifested in the content. I say keep writing...with that exsitential edge, keep telling the story through your fiction...post rebellion fiction."
3,ok,"its good but the center is bowing down a little, the body is not strong enough to carry the weight"
4,excelent CD,"After years away from mexican music, finding this CD on a shelf at the local music franchise store(Tower), BLOWED ME AWAY. How this CD puts together every song I could have ever thought of buying from ""los tacubos"" is magnificent! Of course being the thrifty concious shopper I am, I came here where after searching for it, purchased it. If you are looking for a good, fun, artistic cultural sound that reflects mexican culture, you're in luck ! cause you just found it. I really don't care why this CD was put together, or why there's so many good songs on it ... I just have to say, THANK YOU ! two thumbs up, WAY UP !"
3,good for removing paint scratch,"Takes some effort to rub if you want it to do its job on scratches. In cases where the scratch is not a scratch but the paint deposit from the other object, it does a decent job or removing it. Haven't tried it on swirl marks but I suppose it should do a good job there."
1,This cd was very terrible,"When i first heard the tracks on this cd...i felt like taking a poop and listening to that mold instead. This cd was so horrible i assumed from Snoop's song ""drop it likes hott"" refered to his own dropping the soap in jail as if it was hott, and meeting buh buh. Well, overall i suggest Snoop retires...being this cd was just plain HORRENDUS Snoop we know you aren't a gangsta beleive me I'd know. so i suggest not wasteing your 12$ on this piece of garbage...go pick up the new Lil' Wayne cd ""Tha Carter"" NO IM NOT A LIL' WAYNE SPONSOR...it's just he's so much better and actually has a flow, and good beats. It's well worth yout 12$ rather than this piece of horse manure cd of snoop. So please trust me on NOT buying this...for god's sakes if you want terrible music go buy JA RULE's new cd."
1,A Green Powder Has Formed on the Cushions,"I purchased two of these cushions in December 2010 and had them in storage until June of this year at which time I put them on my lounges. In July I noticed a green powder on my white dog and then on my grandson. The cushions had a film of green powder all over them. I vacuumed them, but a green powder kept rising to the surface of the lounge. If I swiped my hand over the cushion it had a green powder that wiped right off. Amazon did credit me 25% of the price of the cushions as I didn't want to pack them up and ship them. Amazon didn't know how much, if any $$ could be given me on return. I thought I could wash them, dry them and they might be OK. Nope - A green powder forms on them each time they dry. Has anyone else had this problem? I am going to try to contact Strathwood and see what they say. Meanwhile, I wouldn't recommend them at all!!"
4,Good mixer,Overall this is a good mixer with good attachments. It also looks great when left on the counter. I just wish I knew it wasn't variable speed when I bought it. That might have made me change my mind.
1,Junk,I had my doubts when purchasing this card reader but bought it anyway. Have tried to use it on multiple occasions but had no luck.
1,Um...,"This stuff is pretty boring and they sound kind of like they were made to make a lot money off of kid's at the Warped Tour who like to call these bands ""emo"". It sounds kind of like some fans of Winger and Taking Back Sunday doing a jam session."
4,Nice read,"Very pleasant read. Enjoyable and fun.Characters are unusual and off the cuff.I wasn't looking for a read that was mind bogglingThis book fit the bill.If you want something that you can kickback, relax and smile a little, this is it."
2,Worked great for a while...,The good....I loved that I could let my kids listen to music without worrying about ear damage from headphones. The form factor was great and it was much smaller in person than I realized (a positive).The bad.... it had glitches in the first couple of weeks that required me to take the battery out. Then it just stopped working.Wouldn't buy another one.
3,Old superheroes never die ...why fade them away?,"Is it me or do these revamped superfriends looked a lot better in their recent animated series than they do here in JUSTICE LEAGUE? I mean, Superman's new costume has all its reds and yellows in a horrible whiter shade of pale, Batman now wears heels (why -is Wonder Woman taller than him?), Aquaman looks like a biker and the Martian Manhunter, well, he was never very interesting to begin with. Hawkgirl and the black Green Lantern look fine but they seem forced, like token minority superheroes. On top of it all, the stories, backgrounds and villains are dull and predictable; second-best at the most.Too bad, and certainly not what was expected from Bruce Timm, Paul Dini and their great animation studio. I dunno; it appears their new productions have run out of steam (or money). If so, go pester the people at Warner! Have them take another look at BATMAN: MASK OF THE PHANTASM and get inspired again, not just milk the supercow!!!"
1,Aerobics Class Meets Golf?,"Not much on how to put together a program, mostly exercise photos, most of which appear to be exercises from the aerobics class at my club. Elite? My oppinion is NOT!"
3,An eclectic amassing of the evolving jungle/drumnbass sound,"Sampling the vocals of Chuck D from Public Enemy, Natural Born Chillers add a level of rawness that one misses from the early 90's days of jungle (rawness that is altogether vacant from the current evolutionary genre of drum and bass). Although the beat falls into an unsophisticated any-4-year-old-with-a-drum-machine march that chugs along with an ever so perky bass riff, it's that vocal track that brings you back. On paper, ""If you really like to rock the funky beat"" sounds simplistic, lame, embarrassingly passe even, but Chuck D's almost hoarse rap, processed to become an almost rhythmic element unto itself, would make even the most jaded and well-versed DJ hard pressed to not sing/rap along...Plus with some surprising mixxes that have no family resemblence whatsoever to the original track/"
3,Acoustic is a disappointment,"As a huge Lennon fan, I was looking forward to this release. Although there are a few gems on it such as the acoustic version of Cold Turkey, as well as the alternate versions of tunes from his first solo record (which, along with Imagine)is arguably his best album, as a whole, this CD comes across as a hodgepodge of great tunes and near misses. For a professional release, it sounds and has the feel of being a good bootleg collection. The songs vary in quality, mostly sounding clear and sharp- to a couple that are of inferior quality-and not quite listenable. The songs are also assembled haphazardly, with mostly studio (and/or in home recordings)to a couple of live songs that distract from the continuity. Avid Lennon fans out there may be irate with this review. However, if you are a completist, you will acquire this disc, but I cannot recommend Acoustic for the casual fan. For the novice fan, buy Lennon's first two solo albums. That is all you need..."
2,Two Strikes and you're out,Unit vacuums small dry spills well..this is the second one we purchased to replace a unit whose off/on switch went...now the same problem is happening with this one....never again
2,Going through the motions,"First let me say that Cale is one of my very favourite artists: I consider him a genius. But when I saw him in 1983 (supported by Jon Richman) and in 1986 he was genuinely live, even frightening; didn't use damn lyric sheets (reminds me of Peter Hammill on VDGG's 'Paradiso' DVD) and paid attention to the audience. Here he treats the audience with disdain, as if he could barely wait to plunge through the set, do the obligatory scream or two and get a cab back to his hotel room. I've owned the Audio version of this since it was released, and trust me you're better off without the video. Cale is one of my heros, but watching this and comparing it to similar shows I saw live a decade before, it sucks."
1,A Mother's Prayer,"This was so bad, the actors were not, just the plot and the way they went about it. Sorry, I would not recommend this play to anyone."
1,Not a story,"I did not like this book. I did not like it because it is very boring.This book is about the soviet spyagency and its history, all the way back to Napolean.You would like this book if you want to get information, not if you want a story. Do not read this thinking it is a story. You will get very bored with it."
1,How NOT to make a game,"This has to be the worse game i've ever bought. The graffics are horrible. The controls make me wonder if this game was ever tested, and the lenght of the game...there is none. I finished this game in about 1 hour, 55 minutes of it getting use to the controls. In tournament mode, you surf on about 5 different waves and that's it. Other than that, there is a vs. screen, but why? DON'T BUY THIS!!!!!"
1,This is a soofee translation,"Beware of this book, it is the soofee way of introducing their version of the Qur'an. Full of errors. Stay away."
4,"sed, awk ... useful tools","sed and awk typically get a bum rap from perl users. ""why learn sed or awk when perl can do both?"" yes, it can. and so much more.but what if you just need to print, say, the first field of a file? or just replace a few characters in a stream? what about the situations when you dont have perl handy (ie a freshly installed IRIX box)?the sed & awk book is *the* standard. it's not written by anyone famous or whatnot, but it does a fantastic job of covering the basics, the meat, and advanced uses of sed and awk (and variants).if you spend time on the command line and need to know a few quick tips, this is the book to have for sed and awk. you'll learn regexp material, how to use sed and awk and a bunch of useful routines.highly reccomended for UNIX shell geeks."
5,Tyler is great,"Tyler is great his music is so fresh and new and like nothing i have heard before everybody should buy this album his songs Glad and Pink and Black are brilliant. Tyler is just what we have been waiting for. He also features on the One Tree Hill soundtrack and duets with Bethany joy Lenz and they make a fantastic duo.If you like Tyler then join his website at www.tylerhilton.com, Review by Sarah O'Keeffe"
4,Sturdy,This shoe was really sturdy and lasted me a long time. I wore it on more day to day routine and it took the daily grind well.
1,The Searchers,"poor color,skips..I will return movie. product arrived in a timely manner,fair price,etc ect ect ect ect ect.........................then screw it too much trouble garbage can is closer and i shall not reorder............."
1,Not new,"Length:: 0:51 MinsThese binoculars were advertised as new. The box was damaged, previously opened, and resealed using circular tape tabs. The internal packaging was damaged and items were laying loose inside of the box. I was very disappointed with my purchase because it was a gift for my 11 year old son.The view finder for the digital camera doesnot stay upright. There is no way of knowing what the condition of this item is (new or used). Very disappointed with my purchase experience."
4,Good stuff!,"UPS dropped off this DVD this morning at my doorstep. Yes, I've already watched it. : ) Anyway, I'm suprised at the quality of sound and video for this concert video. It's really pretty good, especially for something that was recorded in 1970. I thought the audience's response was pretty funny during the begining of the show. They just sat there as Emerson coaxed all sorts of neat sounds out of his Moog synthesizer. Back then synthesizers were pretty new and weren't often used in popular music, so I guess the audience was a little shocked! I agree with all the comments posted before me. It was pretty aggravating to see the video special effects and cartoons(?!). I'd rather see the musicians! If you liked ELP in their hey-day, I recommend getting this video. Just be aware that much of it does contain the video effects."
4,NOT just another repeat compilation,"Big surprises come in small packages. These are some of Jerry's greatest hits, but not the normal studio released recordings. These versions kick with a live swing orchestra...is that Harry James? Judging by Jerry's voice, these are early live recordings from the 50's. (The insert doesn't supply any recording dates.) His vocals are strong and impressive. Another surprise is ""My Heart Tells Me"", which as far as I know, has never been released by Vale in any form. For the most part this CD is pretty good. The only downside is that a couple of the songs have static in them. You would have thought that they would have digitally cleaned them up. It's still worth looking into, if for nothing else, to hear Jerry Vale with a live swing orchestra, and for the alternative versions of his hits."
4,Shows Improvement,"We've recently starting using Epakitin for our cat, Tucker, who has been diagnosed with renal failure. He's also getting Ringer solution IV's every other day. Along with the Epakitin we're seeing some improvement in his energy and alertness. We'll continue to do everything we can for Tucker."
2,"In less than a year, not funcitoning consistently","I'm disappointed with the reliability of the MX870. After less than a year of very moderate use, I get an error often when I print. It's a cartridge read error. I did call support, and it worked temporarily, but now that the warrantee is up, I stuck with the issue.I'm looking for a reliable all-in-one for very moderate use. Spare me the bells and whistles and just give me something that won't break after minimal use."
4,Love the ocean setting,"I love the time and attention that was put into making this Yoga DVD. I think the ocean setting is wonderful and makes me feel really relaxed, however it makes me too relaxed because I get really tired and end up taking a nap with it on in the background. I love the woman that talks in the DVD because her voice is so soothing. She should make stuff for people to fall asleep to. Its a really great Yoga DVD though."
5,iio cd- single,I absolutely love this band. If you like '4 strings' or 'Everything but the girl' style singing this is the band for you.
3,a disappointing work of ambitious intent,"Eggers takes a lot of chances with the autobiographical format, but this book is ultimatly unsatisfying. There are moments of brilliance, but most of these are tucked away in the addendums and notes in the preface. Eggers uses language cleverly and the imagined conversations are someof the most reavealing sections of the text. I may have enjoyed the book more if the last few pages didn't insult the reader's intelligence."
1,no instructions included,We recently received a George Foreman Rotisserie. When we opened the box....we did not receive an instruction book ofr anything on how to use it! We are not sure what to do?????
1,Horrifying,"Although I have enjoyed Mr. Sedaris's sarcastic humor in the past and found his occasional murky perspective both truthful and poignant, this book was simply too horrific to continue reading. There is nothing entertaining or profound about the murder of an infant. Needless to say I was disapointed in this book. I can only speculate that those who find any entertainment value in a story describing the torment and torture of a baby the very reason our society is rapidly sinking into a state of depravity from which we can never recover. How I long for more of Erma Bombeck's sense of humor."
1,Did not fit filter,purchased this to put around the filter I purchased. When I attempted to put it on the filter the foam began ripping at the seam and as I tried to carefully continue it ripped right in half. Either the sleeve was manufactured incorrectly or it was not the correct one for the product I purchased (90304).
1,Don't Expect to finish watching,"This is a slow moving film. We started one night and tried to finish the next, but Amazon cut off the movie in mid-viewng blaming the ""copyright holder"", so we paid $3.99 to watch a $15 boring movie and we couldn't even see the ending.Advice: Don't use Amazon Unbox. 24 hours is harsh when it's as rigorously enforced as it is with eletronic delivery. We should have at least been permitted to finish watching a movie we were actively watchng when it was cut off.We weren't allowed to finish the movie and you won't either. It's $3.99 lost forever on a sucker deal. Be prepared to lose your investment."
5,Have to own this series!,"Please catch the rest of my reviews on this series. Don't want to repeat myself except that if you love good mysteries and character development, these books are for you. Again, read in sequence."
1,Waste of money. I guess I received what I paid for it.,It did not work for my Portable Hard Drive. It is not recognized by USB port.
5,"Sexy, fun read!","""Nerd in Shining Armor"" by Vicki Lewis Thompson is a great book. This book has every thing:Great Characters, local to die for. This is the story of two people who would never think of hooking, but after crash landing on a desert island, they are forced to a second look at each other. A decide that they like what they see.Besides great main characters, Ms. Lewis-Thompson, gives the reader well developed secondary characters that work well in the story. Overall, this is a summer book that you don't want to miss!"
3,A Bit Boring,"I hate to be the voice of dissent, but this album was a bit hit-and-miss for me. I just couldn't get into some of the tracks, and it gets a bit repetitious. This album did not stand up to repeated listening for me. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed some of the tracks, and the instrumentation is quite good (hence three stars)."
2,Too elementary,"I bought this book hoping for the usual quality and thoroughness of the ""Using"" series. I expected an encyclopedic book and didn't check the page count. This is a comparatively thin ""Using"" volume and covers the basics reasonably well with lots of screen shots. I was looking for advanced information on how to set up custom outlook forms and maybe some pointers on how to do it well. This is not covered. I am surprised you could stretch the basic stuff in Outlook to 200+ pages. I don't understand why anyone would write a guide on using Outlook except to cover advanced applications."
5,Excelente,"Excelente creo que no hay que hablar mucho de ello, su capacidad lo dice todo.......Comprenla son problema simpre llenara sus requisitos...."
1,Crappppppppppppppppyyyyyyyyyyyy!,"If you buy this Cd Ia advise you to either: A.burn it B.burn it C. burn it D.see if you can get your money back , otherwise burn it."
3,It's and alright LP,"I think this LP is a little better than his first but not much. It is very similar in ways how he talks about killing everybody and thats about all he talks about. If you liked his first LP you will really like this one, I'm just not the biggest fan."
5,Christmas Carol,"Christmas Carol, is a classic and worth reading again and be reminded of the beauty of conversion and new life to be lived with joy and generosity."
1,Another Rip-Off,"This is no slip cover but a square piece of cloth. If it had holes, it would be a shower curtain. It runs small as the one I bought hardly covered the piece.I had been watching this item for a while before buying it. The ""sale"" price seems to be the only price."
2,Losing me,"This entire plot of this book could have been written in about 20 pages. I am finding myself not liking characters that I initially loved. In this book, the authors turn Chloe into a complete idiot who jeopardizes herself along with everyone else in the San Diego underground. Ugh."
2,okay but not the greatest,"this book started off great - ellis writes in an entertaining fashion as in his other novels (and takes it back to the basics as he claims to do in the opening chapter). as i got into it, it got a bit too fantastical for my liking. if you are looking for a quick 1-2 day read, you can grab this book. my main problem with the book is that i expected to be moved and feel for the characters, but just when i was about to, uncanny freak coincidences take over and ulitmately those take away from the character development."
4,"Good Sound Quality, but...","I bought these Ear Headphones primarily to use when running and biking at the club. The sound quality is acceptable, not exceptional. The construction is a little flimsy and the big issue is that the cord is shorter for the left ear than the right. That places all the force on the left side and that one tends to pull out. I have no idea why Sony thought that this was a good design. For the money they could also have included a case rather than a clip for the cord. I would give these a B- good/not great."
4,It is a very good product,"If there are somethings need to be improved, they are the accuracy of the pressure gauge and morespace for storing wires."
5,Little kids just love Elmo!,"Very easy to stick to table. My son gets very excited when we use it because of the characters, and I'm very happy he is not eating off tables that have been cleaned with who knows what."
3,A warning about the Japanese threat in WWII,"America's ambassador to Tokyo for the ten years before Pearl Harbor tells why the Japanese think they can win this war and what we must do to defeat them.Joseph Grew was the US Ambassador to Tokyo for the 10 years before Pearl Harbor. On his return home he was shocked at how dangerously Americans underrated the Japanese, and began a series of addresses on the ""real nature of this enemy"". The book is based on these lectures. He was able to leave in August 1942, an alert that the common American public assumption that Japan is weak is unfounded, and that they are at least as potent an enemy as Germany. The book, published under wartime conditions, does not challenge American pre-War policy. However, it sounds an alarm about the struggle ahead. ."
3,Get the full season DVDs instead,"I bought this box set before the full season DVDs came out. It was great to hold me over until season 1 came out, but when I received that, this box set was obsolete. In my opinion, the episodes chosen are good, but they aren't all the best.If you're a real Friends fan (and you must be if you're looking into this set) then just get the full season DVDs. They have 1, 2 and 3 now and will be coming out with them all. You'll be much more satisfied and it's a better investment to have every single episode anyway."
1,Take a look in the toilet,"This is not old Korn. I still have the first Korn CD in the changer, its been there for about 3 years, along with the first Rage Against the Machine. Both bands do very little for me after their first releases. Thats where all the genious is. I give one star to this album because I do feel slightly more afraid by Korn yelling ""Shut up, shut up, shut up I'll mess you up"" than I do by Linkin Park yelling ""Shut up when Im talkin to you!"" both verses are so passionate and so much thought went into them, that I tend to tremble when I hear them. If your giving this piece of crap five stars, then you also have the new Metallica and a poster of Evanescence on your wall, and you've never even heard of the band Anthrax, without which these idiots would not have a job."
4,good pad for the price,"the pad is nothing special, but it works well and it a great choice given the low price."
3,Good read.,Took a little time to get going in the beginning. Was worth it in the end though. All in all a great book.
3,OK,I'm not sure about this heater. It works well but it is long and I seem to hit my toes on it often. It is very very quiet though so could be used anywhere. I guess I am just used to tall cylinder heaters.
2,"Catchy but too formulaic, gets boring fast","Though many of the tracks like Human After All are very catchy and fun however within a week they get very old. Essentially, nearly every track on the album revolves around singing the same few words run through a vocoder over and over again throughout the entire song. While there are some cool manipulations of sound and nifty techno guitars, the obviously formulaic approach to constructing each track lends the album to a short shelf life. Also, the beginning of ""The Brainwasher"" seems lifted directly out of Black Sabbath's ""Ironman"" humorously. A fun album, but not one that you'll get much replay value out of."
3,I'll be honest...sorry....,"What KMFDM has become essntially, is a metal band... the electronics and the programming have become mor and more scarce... Now we have Acoustic Drums on almost all the songs, Lucia (which,whom i like but there;s a little bit of overkill with her..) takes over a lot of the album, The song Hau Ruck is amazing and there's alot of old style KMFDM here but they don't quite make it.. It's sad when you look to industrial music and have to see Mighty forces like KMFDM, Nine Inch Nails, Marilyn Manson (Who really isn't that great anyway) just not having it anymore.. I suggest bringing back Esch and Shultz and Kmfdm will be back.. So i guess all we have now is Skinny Puppy (Amazing), Slick Idiot (which not alot of people even know who they are...), Foetus, Ministry, and a few others that still keep the genre alive.. at least some bands don't want to hear MSI for the rest of their lives.. As for Hau Ruck, better that WWIII but not the best..."
3,BR1 was great. BR2 was a kidz war movie. Extra disc...,BR1 was not as good as the novel but they did squeeze in as much as they could into the movie. BR2 was obviously created to capitalize on BR1's success but I couldn't really enjoy a war movie fought by 9th graders. The actor playing their teacher was gross over acting. The 3rd disc only had Korean subtitles and I didn't understand Japanese. Buy BR1 and bypass the other two discs unless you're really die-hard fans.
5,one of my favorites ever,"This movie combines so many different emotions, and sets up a dreamworld and story for you to fall in love with. But if you're thinking of buying it, you've probably already seen it. The only reason to buy this DVD is if you want to see it over and over again, and if you want see the added features...which are interesting once. As far as the movie goes, I can do nothing but give it 5 stars."
2,Defective battery holder door,"I do like this trash can, EXCEPT for the poorly fitted door to the battery holder. If I move the trash can, or if someone accidentally bumps it, the door becomes dislodged, and the batteries shift, losing their contact points. As a result, the can is no longer a ""touchless"" one. There is no damage to the door--it's just a defect in the engineering and production. There's no way to exchange it, as the postage to return it would cost too much. I've resorted to taping not only the door, but also the batteries. It is an annoying workaround. For this reason, I cannot recommend paying the price for this can unless you buy it locally and return it if yours, too, is defective."
1,waste of time and money,"much inferior to the warren buffett way, not to say the making of an american capitalist,in the begining of the book, the author says he will analyse buffett's investment in commodities and give a book list for further study, but these are no where to be found in the book,what do you expect from such an author?another chapter 'buffett's personal holdings' just copy all the charts and figures from yahoo, without any analysis of why buffett bought and sold them, what is it if not just for making the book thicker to sell more money,another chapter just summaries buffett's articles in fortune, again where is the originality?most unfortunately i bought it from a book shop that has no refund policy"
4,Awesome watch but terrible wrist band,"The features of this watch are very excellent and its capabilities are unmatched, as of yet. I had bought the black plastic wristband version of this watch earlier and it tore apart after two years. A replacement wristband cannot be found in the stores except if you mail your watch in for repair with Timex directly.So I thought a metal wristband version would be a better substitute, I was wrong. It is uncomfortable to wear and heavy, and the watch keeps slipping. If you need to adjust the length of the wristband you need to take it to a jeweler/watch repair to get the metal link/s removed to the right length. I tried doing it myself using my own precision screwdrivers but could not.Despite its downfalls, the watch features still outweigh the negatives. If not for its terrible choice of wristbands, I would of gave this watch 5 stars."
3,mindlessly mediocre,"For parents, this is just plain dumb. It is slapstick. Perhaps it is like seeing the Three Stooges for the first time as an adult: unless you got it emotionally at about age 5, it is a real zero.The kids will watch it, but it will degrade their minds. I know, I spent my childhood watching the stooges, and it sure didn't do anything for me with the ladies.Not recommended, unless you don't care what you shovel into a kid's head."
2,Legends in their own minds,"Overrated is the word that comes to mind when I think of this. Can any collection of songs sound anymore similar than these? All I can say is, you hear one you hear them all."
1,Less Than Useless,"I bought the hype on this product, after all it was a Coleman and their laterns, stoves etc. are pretty doggone good.This thing, however, has never worked as advertised, not even close. The first tip disintegrated, the second barelyworked. never soldering worth a flip. Disgusted, I put it out at a yard sale, marked at $1, with no takers.Don't waste your money."
4,Time to change the product picture... False Advertising,"Product works as intended and great price, but really pi$$es me off when you get a brown box recycled item after you order a ""Original HP LaserJet 27X Black Print Cartridge in Retail Packaging - Dual Pack"" and the pretty HP box is shown in the ad.So far so good, no problems with product itself yet. Been using it for about 6 months now, very low duty cycle, so I have toner for a while.So.... what's the deal with all this?"
1,BUYER BEWARE- THE DO NOT HONOR WARRANTY,"Within the first week of purchase of this product the stylus went bad. The retail store would not exchange so we had to call leap frog. Leap frog was unwilling to replace the stylus contrary to the terms of their warranty and i understood that after 3 seperate calls to them to representatives that had a hard time grasping the englisdh language. I guess they too outsource their customr service center to some country on the other side of the world. Needless to say, we will never purchase any product again from this company."
1,Innyrds,Something is off with the songs on this one? I can't put my finger on it but Free Bird lacks energy or something? I am getting rid of this one and finding a different CD of theirs.
1,Bad...Just Bad...,"I was very upset with the album. When their first album came out it was ok. Awake was ok too. But the band is not as good as they used to be to me. The only way i could tell the difference in the songs was when the face of my radio indicated it was on the next track. I may be somewhat of a fan but am NOT tone def. If your looking for good metal and your in the Cleveland area I HIGHLY recommend 13 FACES these guys are F*****g awesome. Don't buy this album it's not worth the money but I must say this the fact that people say this band is no good because they are a AIC rip-off is getting tired itself, find something else wrong with the band would ya because the reviews will start to sound like Godsmacks music THE SAME!"
2,Mainly for beginners,"Pros- if you know the topic, it's easy to find- explanations are short and sweet- good bathroom readingCons- very little explanation of the benefits- very little practical examples- not enough depthBottom Line:Buy it if you are new to Outlook or if it is worth a few bucks to learn a couple of new tricks."
1,Broken,I needed my Motorola radios today but they were defective and I am still waiting for Motorola to get moving and send me a replacement set. Buy Cobra or Midland.
1,Hype-onomics,"Okay, it's interesting enough, not a bad read, some compelling ideas, but this has got to be the most self-congratulatory book ever. It's about a brilliant ""noetic butterfly"" (really, that's the smooch the author gives the economist) who shocks the establlishment, and the brilliant journalist who gains his trust and respect, and then the brilliant journalist quotes his own brilliant articles about the brilliant economist and calls that a book. It's a little insulting how we're supposed to be blown away by these mavericks. I'll give them credit for making science sexy, for making economics and statistics seem like valid tools, but please, fellas, a little humility, a little less marketing, and, if you really need to make out this much, get a room."
2,I kept wanting it to be better,"I had a hard time finishing this book, but I did so I guess that's something. It read a lot like RL Stine's adult fiction which is overly dramatic and full of needless cliffhangers, like someone who is used to writing for teenagers and can't quite translate for adults. I thought the story was interesting, especially the twist, but it didn't really capture me like it could have because I was distracted by the awkward writing style. Luckily, I got it from the library."
3,Pricing issues,"I bought this product for $30 and when it arrived it had a sticker for a chain store with the price of $19.99. Please next time at least remove the price tag. The box was a bit beat up as well. The movie itself was just fine though so, overall, I'm satisfied with my purchase."
3,"Good for heat, bad if left on","If you simply use this to move a hot pan and take it back off, it's fine. I made the mistake of leaving it on the pan while cooking and it actually began to melt at the end. I have a gas range, and either the flames were a little high or the heat transferred to this - either way BE CAREFUL when using this - and don't leave it on while cooking."
5,To the people who gave this novel a bad review...,"Wow... I can't believe what people said about this book.. I am the worst reader ever.. I hate it with a passion.. But I had to read this book for my Grade 12 Independant Study Project. I was dreading reading it, but i was hooked as soon as i opened it. I truly feel for people when they go through struggles, especially in this case of being separated from their families, and for someone to call this book crap? How would you like to write a novel that is not only ""better"", but express yourself and share your pain with the world and have people like yourself call it crap.I actually hate to read but this is one book I am glad i did. It made me look at Canada completely differently, and realize that we are not so perfect after all. I hope we have finally learn from our past for once."
5,A great read,James Dean: A biography is one of the most compelling biography's to date on the mysterious man that was James Dean. It is very clear that Mr. Howlett knows what he is talking about and is ver researched in the field. Unlike many books out now on dean his sexuality did not come into play often in the book. A must have for a Dean fan wishing to be more in touce with there dead legend.
5,It doesn't matter who you are,"What I'm trying to say is that if you care at all for yourself, you will read this book now.You're not obligated to believe in anything it says, although the footnotes on p.388-423 might convince you otherwise.You're not required to believe anything the author says, unless you care about your health.If you don't want to die of heart attack, stroke, get cancer, or any other disease I suggest you read this book. The whole world suggests you read this book.Even if you read only 10% of the pages in this book, you will be affected.If you care about truth in any way, shape, or form, then you should read this book.If you care about your life and the lives of those around you, and don't want your loved ones to die of heart attacks or strokes, then I suggest you read this book.If you are interested in learning more about why birth defects occur, then maybe you should read this book. Then again, you might not care. (But still, some people do.)"
1,The tool for the job that doesn't exist!,"Purchased the disc to complete a set for the processor. It is entitled a ""French Fry"" disc. If the product it yields is a French Fry, it is for serving in a doll house. In actuality it is more of a cole slaw making disc at best.It does process food, just not in the size or shape it is billed out to do."
5,"It has become our baby bible, an excellent reference book",For new parents this is an excellent comprehensive guide to what to expect and how to deal with the unforeseen and unexpected. It is clear and concise. The authors are objective and do not put down mothers who might not be able to give themselves 100% to their babies. This is perhaps the best investment we made before Oliver's birth.
1,HORRIBLE BACKPACK,"I bought this for my son who is almost 1 year old. I ended up returning it 3 days later. I am a petite woman (5'2"") and this item was totally uncomfortable! I still have bruises under my arms from this item. I followed all directions and no matter what could not get it properly positioned as shown in the pictures of the manual. It bounced on my back and the straps dug into my armpits. I would NOT reccomend this item for anyone who is as petite as I am. NOT WORTH THE MONEY"
1,Not good if you live in a windy area,"I bought this for ""1"" party. I knew we were going to have rain and I thought it would be great. I live in Delaware and it was for an April event. So yes, rain did come, along with winds up to 30 miles an hour. The tent came down, we secured it up, once it couldn't pull up it twisted like a pretzel, velcro ripped, bars bent. It was really nice looking when we put it up, just make sure if you are getting it, it's not going to be really windy at ANY point, as it would be fine and then a gust would come and it's over. The next day half of it looked normal, the other half looked like a tornado came through."
1,ZERO Stars - DO NOT BUY this piece of junk!!,"Oh boy. still images of Christmas cards, mall santas, Christmas trees, toys, and decorations with musical background. The people who gave this DVD a good review either live in a cardboard world, or they work for the company who produced this hunk-o-junk!"
3,Buy Metzger and Aland before this one!!!,"If your into textual criticism, definitly get Metzger and Aland's books (both named TEXT OF THE NEW TESTAMENT) before this one.Kind of a strange book, on one hand it give you very basic introductry info on textual criticism, then it dives into some very complex comparison/contrast of greek wording in variant readings of some of the more important witnesses (i.e. p66, p75, Aleph, B, etc.) -- You'll have to be pretty sharp in greek to make any sense of these....For your money, you're much much better off getting Metzger's and Aland's books. You will learn WAY MORE!!!I would only recommend this book to someone who has first read and enjoyed the books mentioned above. -- but even then, the buyer will be disappointed in the amount and depth of info when compared to Metzger/Aland.Recomendation: Save your money, there are so many other great books to buy ahead of this one.Eric"
4,A great story teller tells a great true story,"Alan Moorehead does wonders with the story of Charles Darwin aboard the HMS Beagle. This is a very readable version of the voyage for the non-biologist and the non-sailor. Other accounts of the story (including Darwin's) can be tedious to the casual reader, but this reads like an adventure novel. The book uses many direct quotes and MANY illustrations made during and immediately after the voyage. This text with these illustrations brought together makes a wonderful presentation of one of the most important voyages in history."
1,"Squirrel's ignored this ""treat""","I put this out and left it for over a week and it was completely ignored. They much prefer the Birdola 54332 Squirola Big Ol-Feet Kob-Feet Squirrel Food. Watching them in my small back yard was very enjoyable until I put out the ""log"". I ended up throwing it in the lake which the snapping turtles & fishes enjoyed very much. I guess it gets very soft or something because it didn't last very long at all."
4,Very good condition,"My book arrived at time and in a very good conditionn, only the cover was kind of damaged but it's ok, it was very cheap and the content is in a very good condition"
3,"Thriller, not by the sci-fiction writer","This book is NOT by Robert Charles Wilson, the highly regarded science fiction writer. It is by Robert C. Wilson, a different writer altogether. That said, the book is a well constructed horror story that is likely to appeal to fans of Stephen King and his genre."
3,Be very very cautious!,"As per another review in the listing... I have seen Intuit literally ruin this product by releasing versions of Quicken that, quite frankly should have never been release. I can tolerate the bugs in Turbo Tax (as it is a very time sensitive releast) - but based on all the bugs that they have had to fix on version 5 (they are on their 4th update... and it's not even a year old - one of which states when you go to their troubleshooting web page that there is a know error of which there is no fix or go around, and will be fixed with the next release, so you can have THEIR mistake fixed for 60 bucks). Also, trying to get a live person will cost you money, a long distance charge as there is no 800 number, and a hold time of 30 minutes or longer. Quicken used to be an outstanding product... I hope someday they will return to their roots!"
3,it was okay...,"This is another one of those cds I was happy to hear a friends copy of, but glad I didn't buy. I enjoyed the songs ""Bukouski"" and ""The Devil's workday"". And I only liked devil's workday because I think that Tom Waits is a genius and they were obviously listening to him and/or this other guy who's name escapes me. I want to say something like Captain Beefheart or something. I guess I can understand the hype with all the kids liking the indie music nowdays, maybe that's why I didn't freak out about it though..."
4,good guide for the shy at heart,"The book is written in a very nurturing style, has exercise pages for self reflection and motivates you to keep going despite obstacles.Small enough to be read during break or while waiting for an appoinment.It has a bio of women from the past who over came odds and succeeded. A must have for your libary."
5,Most Popular Freestyle Song!!,I never get tired of hearing this song. Four different versions and they are all great. In my opinion this song is representative of the Freestyle Music Genre. Judy is the best and has the most sexy voice too.I feel very fortunate to have seen her perform just once many years ago.She was full of energy and has the best personality. Only good things to say about her career. I love her very very much.My most favorite female vocalist.
1,Rubbish,"They sent a T shirt which was completely diffferent to the one I had ordered, admittedly, it was sent quickly, but when I queried the wrong one, they admitted that they didn't have any of the advertised product. I would like a refund, but I shan't hold my breath!"
4,Works great...,"As advertised. I didn't give it 5 stars because that would be perfect, and I don't think there is any such thing, especially when it comes to getting rid of fleas. It won't take care of your flea issue alone, but in conjunction w/ other things, it's a great tool."
1,I wouldn't waste my money on this!,"10 base ethernet is outdated technology. I worked for my school's info-tech department for a year and Netgear hubs were notorious for breaking, we have since switched to agere and have far fewer problems."
2,no more shopping sprees for me,"I'll admit it I was on a spending spree when I picked this up expecting good music again since writings and survivor were great, despite beyonce's weak solo album, big mistake! Lose My Breath, Through With Love and Girl were the only good songs on the CD. They're very very talented ladies with voices but the music did not reflect that at all. They're going the same route en vogue were going as they faded towards the end of the 90's as a group despite the talent."
1,Broke the next day.,"Garden Song 480-12 Classic Bird FeederThe price on this product is what made me buy it. The problem is that it's very cheaply made and I found mine,the next day on the patio floor, broken and I was left with a big mess from the bird seeds. I guess it's not supposed to have so many seeds or so many openings for the birds to feed from to withstand the weight. Overall, I am very dissapointed and I do not recommend it. Look for something sturdier if you want it to last."
4,Vintage Carson!,"Got this for my husband after he'd seen the infomercial. Not only a great price on Amazon, but he laughed until he fell off the sofa. Hours and hours of vintage Carson."
3,High level overview with examples,This book provides a couple of good example of using DOM scripting but doesn't give enough information to teach DOM CSS or Javascript. You will need additional books.
4,L'histoire romancée,"Excellent roman où l'on apprend du coup plein de faits historiques très intéressants. Et c'est beaucoup plus passionnant qu'un livre d'histoire! Je vais entamer la suite, SECRETUM, bientt!"
5,Awesome,this is by far the most awesome thing ever but my shrink says if I take these pills i won't see you guys anymore
2,Disturbing,I have read several of Coulter's books and love most of them. I read this books some years ago and was like most of the readers completely disturbed by it. I couldn't get past the gang rape and almost didn't finish the book because of this. I had even purchased the series prior to reading this one and i have yet to read that one because this one distrubed me so much. This is defintely not for the faint of heart. I read romance novels to escape the everyday and look forward to a happy uplifting book this book is defintely not the one to read if you are looking for that and what makes it worst is the second novel is about there daughter and the son of the women responsible for Cassie being gang raped how twisted is that!
3,Not As Good As His Prior Work,"Because it's Lenny, it is very good. But I feel that it falls behind his previous works."
2,Handy?,"I love the catalog rack, this was called an extension to the rack. There is no place to add this set of panels to the rack."
1,A poor attempt at unfounded conjecture,"It seems that none of the articles have any substance in undermining the topics they attack. For example, Uri Geller, who has proved his ESP in labs worldwide, is simply poo-pooed without contradicting scientific example. This is hardly skepticism; it is simply automatic gainsay. I'm sorry but this book was a real disappointment. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY BY BUYING IT."
1,Edited? Not Worth A Single Penny,"What a cheap release. ""Roseanne"" is the number one show I've waited many years to own, like other fans. Everytime I watched one in reruns, I would say ""I can't wait for the DVD to come out so I can see all the cut out footage!"" Well, guess what. That's not happening, so I'm not buying the set.I was so excited to spend lots of money collecting the show but it looks like I now have one less thing to do.All these one star reviews on page one should be enough to stop unsuspecting customers from blowing their cash on this cheap mess."
3,"Works great, if only for a day","It worked really well on my mini schnauzer, except it broke after one day of use. I'm hoping that it was just a ""flook"". I plan on buying another soon to test this theory."
3,ok hygrometer,Got 3 of these and they all say that it was pre-celebrated but when I did the salt test 2 of them show the same results and 1 show a lot lower %. With the salt test it is suppose to give a 75% humility on the hygrometer which none of them gave. I even left it over night but still could not get 75%. I did match it up to one of the analog meters and it was pretty close. About 1 -2 % difference.
3,Let the reader beware - this is more novel than letters,"I, like the many reviewers of this book, was enthralled and inspired by this collection of letters when I first read it 25 years ago. I have recommended it to many friends. At the time I would have given it five stars or even more if they were available. Irving Stone writes in his preface ""My aim has been to edit the 1670 pages of material down to a swiftly flowing, continuous normal-sized book..."" He succeeded but even 25 years ago I was a little disturbed by the complete absence of indications where exactly Mr. Stone had done his cutting, or his editing. Today, in the age of internet we can now do some easy checking. The unabridged letters are on the net and reveal that basically what this Dear Theo is, is another novel written by Irving Stone. There is almost no resemblance to the original letters. The novelist has used his talents and the raw material to create a beautiful saga. Worth reading, but let the reader beware."
4,"Easy-to-read love story, but too predictable","I decided to read this book after seeing previews for the movie (although I have not seen the movie yet). I was looking for an easy read that I hoped would not be too much of a cheesy love story, and this ended up being just what I wanted. Its not just a love story about a boy and a girl, but its also about a relationship between father and son (the later being what actually touched me more emotionally.) About halfway through, most things started to become predictable for me though. It does have a bit of an awkward ending, which left me wanting a little bit more, but at the same time I was glad that the author didn't sell out and conveniently kill off anyone just to give the readers the ending we'd want. Of course, it includes familiarities of North Carolina, which I love. All in all, an easy-to-read love story and I enjoyed it... just glad I spent less than $5 on it. (I purchased the Kindle edition for my I-Touch. Kindle is awesome!)"
4,Excellent,"I am a strong fan of Forgotten Realms novels and bought this Ravenloft book by mistake. I am very happy that I made that mistake because this book was great. It got me into Ravenloft and is still the best along with I, Strahd."
2,Eddie's worst movie!,"This movie was as funny as changing an old person's diaper! I love Eddie Murphy, but I didn't find this movie to be very funny. If you want to see Eddie Murphy at his best, see Delirious! This one stunk."
5,Loved this series!,This is one of my all time favorite book series! Loved everything about it and have referred it to many people who feel the same way. It put flesh to some of the people of the Bible and made me love the old testament even more. I can't recommend it enough!
2,Devries/Kors purchase,I think the perfume is old since the smell is somewhat like alcohol. I've used the producut in the past from retail stores so I know what it should have smelled like. I would not buy perfume on line again.
1,The cover is the best thing about this book.,"The games are too complicated and not very much fun. Buy a couple of water guns and teach children the lines, shots, and make them run and the kids would like it so much more. Not a good choice for individual lessons."
5,Great results,"I have used other micro fiber towels before, but never managed to achieve the kind of results I get from these. Ideal for all mirrors and polished surfaces around the home."
2,Makes no sense.,"What really bothered me about this book was the complete lack of accuracy when describing the aliens. This book refers to drones four to five times the size of humans.....wha? And the new species, the rogue, is said to rival the queen in size at almost fifteen meters tall. Fifteen meters? Sorry, last time I watched aliens the queen was about fifteen FEET tall."
4,An excellent book,"I'm only about half way through this book but already I have read some very poignant and moving stories. This book is a collection of short stories by a wide range of women about their personal struggles and life experiences. Some of the stories are extremely well written and all of the stories give a fascinating glimpse into the hearts, minds and lives of ordinary women. This book should be read by both men and women who wish to understand themselves and others better. It's a pleasure to read!"
1,Unhappy Owner,"Purchased a new WDG1U2500 on September 9, 2006. Had to have it replaced and mailed the unit to WD. The replacement was also defective and it was a REFURBISHED one. Returning a defective new unit and receiving a refurbished one in exchange is not right. I hope the second replacement will be a NEW one. Had to pay USPS $17.70 (includes insurance and tracking) for the first return. Hope to make positive comments and give better rating after receiving a replacement and being able to use it. At the moment I wish I had not purchased the unit."
4,Not enough Bruno Ganz!,"Excellent, riviting, chilling. Ganz is amazing! The movie is depressing as it should be. Great German actors but I wanted more Ganz! He is an amazing actor, never a better portrayl of Hitler in my opinion. Overall one of the best movies about the last days in the Bunker ever!"
1,Sloppy Stuff- Not For Beginners,"I'm new to Premiere so I thought this book looks rather promising.I have to admit I haven't read the whole book. I'm still stuck at chapter 1 ('Premiere Quickstart'), and that's because the steps given are not entirely in sequence, some important labels in the diagram are missing (where's the thread area you're talking about?), and things work out differently than described.In summary, this book (at least the first chapter) is a sloppy piece of work. Don't touch it if you're a beginner."
5,Elegant and Simple,I purchased this item as a door prize for a tea party bridal shower. It arrived just a pictured and is really beautiful. Great quality for the price.
1,Bad,"Really bad writing. If this book was $1, it would still be a waste of money. Seriously, it is probably one of the worst books I have ever read."
3,Forceful drama without tonal beauty,"Daniel Börtz is a modern Swedish composer who has published serveral operas. This recording was made at the same time as the complete opera, directed by Ingmar Bergman, was filmed for televison and VHS. I haven't seen a live performance, but I looked for this recording because the main roles were taken by well-known and famous Swedish opera singers, all of them appointed Royal Court Singers: Laila Andersson-Palme, Berit Lindholm, Sylvia Lindenstrand Peter Mattei and Ingrid Tobiasson, to name a few.After the first night at the Stockholm Royal Opera House, Börtz was hailed as an important opera composer. The recording is interesting mainly through well-performed main roles. This is a modern but romantic opera, not atonal in any way. As if hearing a Swedish ""Elektra"" (Richard Strauss) but without that opera's tonal beauty. In fact I find the musical terrible. I can't stand it. The three stars are for the eminent singers."
4,Thrilling,The Book Star Girl by Jerry Spinelli us a great book it is thrilling and shows you cruel and mean ways of high school students just because they see a new type of person who dresses different and basically doesnt go with the flow... This is a great book on how one girl can change people and i reccomend it to anyone.
2,Ridiculously amusing,"The complete lack of reality and character developement left this book at a level which I have seen condemned in fanfiction pieces.Victor was a one sided character. He displayed rage and lust, usually one along with the other. I found his character and the plot so amusing that I admit to reading both this and the sequel. Jesus is tempted by this raging Roman soldier who stalks him? And this Jesus likes to shed his clothing and dance about the hills? Being a Catholic and having gone to a Catholic school I've heard most of the Jesus jokes out there.This book was the longest and most prolonged joke I've ever read."
4,Perfect companion for Maybe It's Live,"I was fortunate to have seen Robert Palmer in concert twice ('91 & '99) therefore I know that this is a performer who should have more than just ONE live album in his catalog. Thanks to this import, we now have two. This recording is from the 1988 tour so a lot of material is from 'Heavy Nova' and 'Riptide' but there's a few surprises including: Looking for clues, John & Mary, Woke up laughing and Pride. Combine this CD with Maybe It's Live and you have the full spectrum of Robert's career. The price of this CD is high but it's worth it."
1,carrie on bluray,very disappointed with this blu ray dvd i have a dvd copy and it surpasses this bluray transfer i wasted 15.00 on this i was really looking forward to seeing the hd picture of this favorite film of mine seller wouldnt give me my money back either so im trying to get in touch with mgm to let them know this is a bad transfer of a great film. : (
4,Great Vacuum Cleaner!!,"I wasn't sure about this vacuum when I got it out of the box until I tried it. It has plenty of suction and does a great job on both hard floors and carpetted floors. I decided to do an experiment with my Dyson and this one. I vacuumed a section of the floor with the Dyson then went over it with the canister. I was surprised to see the amount of dirt the Dyson left behind. I reversed the experiment by using the canister first and then the Dyson. The canister picked up a lot of dirt and the Dyson had virtually nothing.The only things I don't like are the short electical cord and the capacity of the dirt cup. I have to empty it every time I vacuum and wash it out every other week. Overall, for the performance it is worth the extra work though."
2,1200mah Eurus Li-ion Li-10b,"I was under the impression that these Batts. were replacements for my original batteries, they did work with the charge that was in them however they will not recharge with the camera's charger. I now have to find another compatable battery."
4,Not a reference book for the modeller!,"While I would agree that this book turned out to be an engaging read, it was far from what I expected. As an aircraft modeller, I was looking for a book along the lines of Don Logan's excellent books, also published by Schiffer, which are filled with color photographs of aircraft from many different units as well as excellent information on technical data, such as weapon loadouts. Not so with this book. Yes, there are color and B/W photographs, but there are many portions of the book where it is nothing but page upon page of text.In summary, a great history book, but not a good reference for the modeller."
2,Too basic,"I found the topics covered in ""Rewired, Rehired, or Retired?"" to be dated. Chapters dealing with globalization; assessing your needs and interests; and preparing for an interview; repeated facts I have read over and over again. If you our current on today's business trends (Business Week, Fortune, Wall Street Journal etc.) this book, in my opinion, is redundant."
5,I WOULDNT EAT THIS GARBAGE BUT...,"THIS IS MY HUSBANDS FAVORITE CEREAL. I TRIED EDUCATING HIM ON THE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT INFO ON GENETICALLY MODIFIED CORN (PLEASE READ THE 2ND REVIEW!) BUT HE'S A 53YR OLD GROWN MAN MAKING HIS OWN DECISION. I HAD 2 GIVE IT 5 STARS BECAUSE IT ARRIVED QUICKLY, THE PKGING IN PRISTINE CONDITION, THE CONTENTS R FRESH, IT HAS A FAR OFF DUE DATE + COST ME NEARLY HALF WHAT I PAY IN THE SUPERMARKET. BV IF U HAVE MORE SENSE THAN MY HUSBAND, PLEASE DONT EAT THIS STUFF!"
3,Great for everything but Apple TV,"The DIR-655 router worked great with my PC and iMac, but wireless just wouldn't stay connected to my Apple TV device (first generation). Tried a variety of settings after hours of investigation on many Apple and D-Link forums but no luck, would get intermittent wireless disconnects almost daily. Really wanted to keep this router but re-setting up the ATV wireless connection everyday was not very convenient. Ended up re-connecting my old (D-Link)router and sent this one back to Amazon. Will now try a Netgear product. Would not recommend the DIR-655 for those who have a first gen ATV on their wireless networks."
2,did not last long,It was pretty good and reasonably accurate for as long as it worked. But within less than a year it went bad. For no good reason it suddenly shows a completely wrong weight. I'm tired of fancy looking products that don't last.
1,Build your own better and cheaper,"It amazes me that companies still try to build and sell equipment like this for such a ridiculous mark up. With a few basic tools and minimal skill you could build your own out of heavy duty plumbing pipe that would be much sturdier and cost less than half as much. This probably cost them a few bucks to manufacture and might be worth $20, but definitely not what they're asking for it."
1,I'd rather eat ramen than try to stomach this stinker,"What an awful movie. The story was awful. The acting was awful. For such a great actress like Murphy who starred in 8 Mile, Don't Say A Word and Sin City, to do this movie she must have been kidnapped and held at gun point or was flat out desperate. I would even go as far as to say this movie could have ruined her legacy.... but lucky for her no one watched it.Here's something funny about this film.... they spent $32 million making it. The same budget as Source Code starring Jake Gyllenhaal, which was a box office blockbuster and went on to make $147 million.. Just goes to show a movie about time travel in an alternate timeline >>>>>>> cooking ramen.RIP Murphy, so sorry you were involved in this stinker just before your untimely death."
5,Destined to be a bestseller,"This book, written by an amazing woman, has all the depth and more passion than Angela's Ashes. It moved me to tears, the determination of one little girl to overcome the harsh hand life dealt her and convey it to us, her readers. I read this book in one day. I couldn't put it down. Barbara Robinette Moss captivated me and shared the story of a life so foreign to me in graphic and compassionate detail. I loved the book."
4,good size but you have to deal with the cord,"Pro: Good size, boils water fastCon: There is no separate base for the electric cord to be attached to. You have to carry the kettle around together with the cord to fill it with water. Or you can detach the cord, but it's a pain to do it all the time."
5,It is one of the best!,"This book gives fierce competition to Pierre Clostermann's ""The Big Show"" as the greatest fighter pilot biography ever written.It's evocative, emotional, conclusive. Larry Forrester did a masterful job."
4,A hit,"All the LeapFrog toys are a hit in my house. They are very well built and last. My son has dropped and banged this up many, many times, and it still works great. I read other reviews were people had some issued with theirs and I think they might of just got a dud.There are 2 different volume settings, I have found that the loudest is too loud for our house, When you press the music note it plays the ABC song. If you push the space where the lettter is suppose to go with out a letter, it makes a terriably annoying sound (and of course my son does this all the time).I didn't give it five stars because of the where you put the letters. The reason is the terriable sound,a nd because you have to get the letters in there just right. For a toddler sometimes putting the letter in the spot can be a trick."
4,"Harness is great, needed some ""stitched"" adjustments","We bought a medium for our wheaten terrier, who has a rather narrow chest. When she pulls to go after a squirrel, it works wonderfully - pulling her back toward us without yanking either her neck or our shoulders. However, after a few times of going after squirrels the strap across the chest (from where the loop hangs) gets loose; eventually, that strap is hanging down closer to the tops of her legs than across her chest. Tonight I took a heavy needle and some carpet thread and after setting the chest strap to its narrowest position stitched it in place so that it wouldn't slip. Works perfectly now! I recommend this harness - not perfect, but really really good."
3,For a laugh,We saw this on TV years ago and it made us literally laugh out loud. When we found it on Amzaon....couldn't resist buying it.
3,Pretty good- strange shipping and it is plastic!,"It seems pretty good thus far, it can really get some knots but not others.I was so shocked to see it was shipped unwrapped/padded in a huge manilla envelope! yes a paper envelope! It was mostly out of the package when it came to my house- I was annoyed that it was scratched and dragged along who knows where!The 2nd disappointment is that it is plastic- seems fairly strong, but I expected better quality."
5,Indispensable!,"This is the paperback manual that originally came withThe Forgotten Realms Archives. It will come in handy for copy protection purposes, and to read the ""paragraphs"" referred to inside the older Gold Box games. There are now websites out there with all of this information readily available, but for a true retro gaming experience you can't beat the actual manual! There were also code wheels for a couple games, you will probably have to find those online as well."
1,Keep looking......Very boring!,"This book was utilized in a psychology of religion class I just took and it is boring beyond belief. Much of the research that was used in the examples were questionable. (Sample sizes were too small and control of extraneous variables in some seemed non-existant). This field of psychology is very young and needs books that can present credible research in a way that can stimulate interest. This book constantly says more research is needed in this or that area, but does little to show that the field has any credibility to it."
5,Phantom Stallion is a Great Series!!,"I have read the first thirteen of the Phantom Stallion series, and Free Again is one of my favorites. Like all the Phantom Stallion books, a lot of different story lines are presented throughout the book. You get to know not only the human characters, but also the horses, each of which have their own personality as well. I highly recommend the Phantom Stallion series for any horse lover!"
5,"Good Buy, but not. . .","This is my second palm, the first being an m130(pos). This one is MUCH MUCH MUCH better. However, after owning it for only 36 days, it stopped working. I put something into my calendar on the bus to school at about 7 am, then tried turning it on again 3rd period for homework, and nothing. It had over 1/2 a charge just 3hrs earlier, and nothing worked. I plugged it it right when I got home, and still nothing, even using the usb charging and all different resets. (...)Appearantly, over 50 others have had the same problem and told palm about it. I've regretting this buy very much. Gonna try selling it on ebay or something and get a pocket pc. Get a Dell Axim or HP Ipaq instead, much better bang for the buck. I know ppl with them, and they're much better."
1,Slippery when dry,"This is a slippery yoga mat. Your hands will slide, your feet will slide. If you like sliding and hate holding static poses you will love this mat.The mat matches the picture and was delivered on time. The new mat smell goes away after a day or so if you air it out."
4,Even better than the first season,"I've ventured along side some of my favorite DC characters steadily since the beginning of Bruce Timm's amazing run of animation. As good as the first season of the Justice League was Season Two simply outshines it in every single category.Like always, the animation itself is beautifully done and the voice work is spot on. Whereas Season 1 struggled to balance a cast of such incredible power and range, Season 2 has all of the bugs worked out. The set ends with the Starcrossed trilogy which somehow manages to upstage the Origins alien invasion (from season 1) and even ends on a cliffhanger with regards to one of the member's loyalties.Best of all, this entire cast transitions beautifully from the Justice League into the equally impressive Unlimited seasons which followed. Highly, highly recommended."
2,"It's OK, But there are better","I was hoping for something with a little more substance. The Salsa section is entirely on your feet, so if you are experiencing any foot related issues like I am (my arches have fallen during this pregnancy), then this section lacks luster.The instructor just seems to be all over the place in general. At no time did I feel that any particular muscle group was getting attention. There were not enough repetitions at any one time to acheive a feeling of fitness.I purchased 2 other pregnancy workouts that I feel are far better than this one (if any of you are interested.) Check out ""The Perfect Pregnancy Workout"" and ""Fusion Pilates for pregnancy"". The first gives you real challenges that are safe and the second is great for flexibility and aching lower backs."
4,Solid cases,Used these jewel cases to ship games across the country. The cases stood up to the rigours of the postal service and arrived safely. They are light and low profile and provide ample protection -- the price is right too.
1,I'd recommend instead...,"Not sure why so many people are giving high ratings on this one. The acting was sub-par, the lighting design was heinous, and the production was more horrifying than the story. If you want to see a truly creepy indie horror film, check outBaby Blues. I was lucky enough to attend a private screening and was thoroughly creeped out. The acting is better than expected as is the production value. It had some truly unexpected twists. Check it out instead, it comes out on DVD in August."
1,Flimsy construction and can be opened in < 2 seconds,"I purchased one of these units some time ago. After about 4 weeks the electric servo mechanism that opens the internal latch failed to operate, leaving the latch stuck in the closed position and preventing me from using even the key override. Permanently stuck in a closed and locked state. I had to pry the safe door open with screwdriver to recover my firearm (a process that took, amazingly, 45 seconds with a common screwdriver - very soft steel).Also, these safes (at least the model I had) can be opened in under 2 seconds without a key or combo. Make sure you mount them securely so they don't fall and like, hit the ground or anything..."
2,A total Bore!,"Wow, I am really surprised to see that many people rate this movie as good. Both my husband and I were totally bored with this movie and thought it was dry and not very interesting.A waste of a rental..."
4,Good reading,Saw this was a Mac Donald book...3 in one. Did not check who the editor was. While waiting for its arrival I was skeptical. While the editing was less than perfect...the story was not! Great story...glad I bought this book.
5,Great Beans,"Great if you want to try a variety of beans! All of mine were from South America, but I didn't mind. I've only roasted one batch but it turned out just fine."
1,DON&#65533;T WASTE YOU&#65533;RE MONEY OR TIME,"This has to be one of the worst cd's I have come acrossin a long Time. The mixing is not bad but I can't say muchfor the music, Don't waste you're time."
2,Ick,"I love Lemon Jelly, but this album falls far, far short. All the songs seem drawn out and like they got lost halfway through and just don't reach any conclusion. Go with Lost Horizions instead."
2,Not a great fit,"I have a large head and long hair. This cap can't handle both. If anyone has found a cap that will, please let me know."
5,Grey's Anatomy Original Soundtrack,Fabulous soundtrack bought as a gift for my daughter. She absolutely loves it and asked for Soundtrack II as well.
5,roar series,"If you ever saw the show, this is a must have item. The complete series in a great box storage set. For those who enjoy sci-fi but have never seen the series, this is a great gift. Great cinematography , interresting historical take on ireland, strong story lines and a small cast of characters."
4,This movie was hot!,I really liked Denzel role in this movie. I think his role in Malcolm X was way better. But atleast he finally got the credit his acting deserves.
5,Good stroller. Substantial but light. Great price.,"This stroller is very easy to use and to carry. My one year old is super comfortable in it, and the sun shade has good coverage. The storage is small, and I can understand why some people complain about kicking the wheels, or the handles not extending out far enough. For long walks we use a jogger stroller. This is perfect for errands, short outings, crowded spaces, airports, etc. It is SO SO SO much better than the cheapo flimsy kinds of umbrella strollers, and SO SO SO much more reasonable than paying $[...] for something just a tad bit fancier."
1,DON'T BOTHER WASTING YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE.,"If you're like me who watched the first season of OTH and expected a remarkable season 2 and was disappointed.. heavily disappointed, then this DVD isn't for you. I wouldn't waste my money on a season filled with contrived storylines everything from Lucas suddenly loving Brooke, to Peyton suddenly loving Jake to Haley's tortured evil tour with Chris/Tyler Hilton and Keith proposing marriage to Jules when he a few months ago was madly in love with Karen. If you think you can make a connection between your season 1 DVD with this season's DVD, don't hold your breath. It won't happen. Season 2 is a whole different show. A bad show. The show lacks consistency and follow through. Mark Schwann doesn't respect his characters enough to write consistenly for them. Again, don't bother. But Veronica Mars' Season 1 DVD instead."
2,Incredibly tedious experience...,"This film was a disappointment for me, I had never seen it before until this DVD, and being a HUGE hardcore Frank Zappa fan even I found it to be incredibly tedious to sit through. It was just too long and it could have been edited down. I found a lot of it boring and unfunny. It has great moments but as a whole it falls flat on it's face as a film. I found the claymation to be pretty unique and most of the concert footage (not all) was pretty good too, the performance of 'Punky's Whips' is particularly great. I preferred the 'Does Humor Belong In Music?' DVD a lot more. I doubt I could ever sit through Baby Snakes in it's entirety again, thank God for the convenience of DVD Chapters."
5,No problems,"I purchased the Interlink Electronics VP4810 on August 22, 2007 and have been using it through the USB connection to a computer using Windows XP as the OS. I had used this product for a number of years at one institution that supplied the units but moved to another institution that did not. I was not happy at all with the wireless mouse the institution supplied and which was the only tool I could use to advance slides when away from the computer desk, so I purchased my own VP4810 and use it as a portable unit. I have had absolutely no trouble with it (I downloaded the software from Interlink's website rather than use the disc that came with the unit so I could, hopefully, get the most recent software version). I admit I use it only as a two-button mouse and do not, as yet, use all the other features that come with the software. I appreciate the freedom the unit gives me in making presentations and the laser pointer feature is also very handy."
2,Where's the fun?,"Yes, some of the stories were good, but even the better ones were uniformly depressing. Please be warned that selection after morbid selection is based on grief-stricken parents and dead, missing, kidnapped and/or murdered and mangled children (sometimes entire pits of them); of the dead children stories, the ""Buckets"" (ghosts of aborted children) offering several other reviewers mentioned was the MOST cheerful. I'm sorry I bought it, and even sorrier that I waded through the entire thing in the hope that there had to be at least one gem of entertainment in there. I like horror as a genre, and rarely part with books, but this one hit the trashcan."
5,Attractive & Functional,"I love this bird feeder. I use it for feeding squirrels on the ground (minimizes their attraction to the hanging bird feeders!). Even though it is heavy, I find that I have to secure the base by burying it a bit or my furry friends will topple it. But birds would have no such problem."
1,Do NOT buy this game,"I'm on dialup, and the game said it can be played on dialup. Well it can't. After 50 straight hours spent downloading the patches, I finally got to start the game. It was as boring as boring can be. Plus, at dialup speed, just forget it. I complained to Sony and they were ""gracious"" enough to refund my monthly subscription money. But I'm still out the $20 I paid at Walmart.I'd give this game negative stars if that was an option. No use rehashing what the others have said. The missions are pointless, unrealistic, take forever to complete, and grant you very small rewards.This game is a complete STRIKE OUT."
5,Careful By The Motels,"Why the Hell are so many great records, like this one, unavailible on CD? I bought this on vinyl when it was new. I was already a Motels fan. This album, while a little different and less avante garde than the first, totally kicks as none the less!It is a little less guitar oriented than the first album but the songs are unique, hook laden, and catchy. Of course, I don't have to tell you that Martha Davis voice is as beautiful and haunting as ever. If you are a fan of the Motels and have missed out on this gem, GET IT IF YOU CAN!! Why this great band didn't stay huge after their 3rd album is a mystery to me."
1,not compatible with cybershot T30,"This battery does NOT work with my sony cybershot t30, thus the product title is misleading! The camera says ""infolithium only"" and shuts down. I recommend buying the [more expensive] sony infolithium battery."
1,It's a Dead End. It's so absurd that I stopped watching it after 15 minutes,"In this film, samurais fought with swords, guns and even anti-tank guns! It tried to be Mad Max but it failed miserably. The clothings and scene settings looked cheap and fake. The acting is like child's play. It's more like a comedy but it's not funny at all. How can they expect to make money with this? This is a typical bad B-movieIf you like Asian-style sword-fighting movies, look for House of flying daggers, Shinobi Heart under Blade, Shadowless Sword, Warrior (Korean movie), Iron Monkey. These movies are much better in terms of fighting and acting."
3,Important attention for customers,"Just to mention that there is another box set from Brilliant classics; that is in white; same label; less cds, part of this more complete edition ! Don't be confused : The red box set is the same as the white one with more cds; artists added : make a choice and buy one or another with different charges; relative prices ! Happy hollidays, music lovers !Chopin Edition: Complete Works (17 CD Box Set)"
4,Beautiful,"The Shadow of the Wind is a beautiful novel. It's beautifully written and i really enjoyed reading it. I first saw the book at Suria KL City Centre's Kinokuniya bookstore with the 'gem of the month-sticker' on it. I read the synopsis at the back and few first pages. Then i felt in love with it and just bought it. It is a gem and once a gem, it's always a gem"
2,Overblown,"Porcupine Tree finally has made it to the major leagues, and the technical side of ""In Absentia"" reflects that. The sound is crisp and booming (credit engineer Paul Northfield), but the soul is missing from the songs.It appears that Steven Wilson has had a field day in the studio, for every track on ""In Absentia"" is littered with excessive effects. (The tired ""voice on the telephone line"" effect is used on at least three songs alone!) The effects detract from anything that Steven Wilson might be trying to say -- either lyrically or musically.If you're new to Porcupine Tree, check out ""Lightbulb Sun"" or ""Stupid Dream"" for the band's melodic side and ""The Sky Moves Sideways"" for their prog side instead."
1,Never buy brother,Brother MFC printers big disappointment...mine broke just at the end of warranty period and i had bad experience with MFC 5100 C also!!!!
5,This tape sticks through swimming and sweating.,I use this tape to keep my insulin pump pods tight to my skin. It stays stuck through swimming and intense sweating yet comes off easy enough when I remove it leaving no residue on my skin. I've had my pods come loose without it and at 50 or more dollars a crack that adds up quick. It is well worth the cost of this tape and beyond.
3,"This book has great pictures, but needs more content","This book has great pictures, and the pages of it are seen all over the web. However, the performance of the exercises needed to complete his ""10 days to massive arms"" claim lack clarity. Mr. Hoeberl should get the help of a more professional writer to complete this book. His methods do work, but you're not quite sure what the method is. His biographical pieces are interesting and informative, though.Brian McDuffie,Personal Trainer,National Health Club Association"
2,Scratches too easily,Light is ok but the plastic used to provide light and see through scratches way too easily.. Should have been made out of glass.
2,"Good rice , but always makes a mess","I bought this one based on the Cuisinart name. After about a dozen uses, it's going in the garbage. A rice cooker should not spew starchy bubbles all over the countertop when filled to only half of it's capacity. Watching how vigorously this boils, my guess is that the heating element is oversized for the bowl. I use a rice cooker to reduce the amount of work, not increase it."
5,Great Package of Films,"Picked this collection up mainly because of the packaging - most of the collections of this type are usually crammed into one of those huge flimsy multi-disc DVD cases. This package has six DVDs with each in its own thin-case. I was also pleasantly surprised to find that the discs themselves were single-sided and not double like some of the other packages that I've had experience with. Now about the films themselves - I must admit that I've only watched a few of them so far, but both films were of excellent quality - leastwise given what was probably available for source material. Each disc does come with a ""bonus feature"", which range from photo galleries of movie posters, to an audio recording of a radio play - plus there are trailers and a feature short titled ""About Film Noir"". All-in-all, I'm very happy with the purchase."
4,California culture and a life in high places,"Looking for Mo is a traditional tale set vertically on a big wall. You know, the wild friend everyone has and wants to be -- you hear reports about his latest adventures through the grapevine, receive cryptic emails from third world countries about how the morning light there is otherworldly. And when he returns you have to come to grips with his wildness, somehow incorporate it into your life and make it yours too, but you can't steal it from him. My version of Mo is in Chiapas, Mexico, somewhere. But I need him there. Duane gives an honest rendition of what it is to have a friend like Mo."
2,One Cable didn't work,I bought two cables and one of the cable ends wouldn't push in all the way in which made it unusable. Maybe i just got a bad cable but overall wasn't impressed by the quality of something that should be a given.
3,Best for sauce or juice.,"The positive features are the comfortable handles and gripping legs that fit on a fairly large bowl. There really was no slippage and overall it made it easy to turn. The mill holds a pretty descent quanity of food. I specifically bought this food mill to rice potatoes to make lefse. The potatoes stuck to the sides of the ricer and the paddle part did not pull the potatoes underneath it to the blade. I had to use a spoon to mash them down so that paddle could catch them. I riced 40 pounds of potatoes so by the end I was actually quite frustrated. I would imagine this food mill is great for applesauce or tomato juice. Some food mills have a small wire that turns along the underside to keep the bottom clean. This food mill doesn't have it which might be a nice enhancement although again needed more for ricing potatoes than making juice or sauce. If the paddle part would be bent up just a bit higher, I think it would grab the potatoes better."
2,I'm glad I borrowed this from the library......,"Okay, I love the singles by Michelle Branch. All you wanted, Everywhere, Breathe and Are you Happy Now are all great songs. I was at the library with my grandma and I saw this CD on the rack. I wanted to try it out because I had heard her singles and I liked them. But this CD does not live up to her singles. Michelle's voice is whiny, annoying and after each sentence in a song, she'll take in this annoying breath.Good Gravy-she sounds like Avril! I can't stand these annoying alternative pop stars. I thought Avril was bad-but this is horrendous. The songs are lame and boring(except the singles). Not to mention unoriginal.You know, she would have a lot of potential if she had other people help write her songs-better yet, don't write the songs at all.I'm soooooo glad that I checked this out at the library. Otherwise, I would have wasted fifteen bucks."
1,Sorry I purchased it!,"I was very excited about purchasing the Kindle. I heard that only brand new books were priced at $9.99 and perhaps a little higher, while older books would be around $1.99 to $5.99. The only time the kindle will be of use to me is when l am traveling. I noticed that l can purchase new paperbooks cheaper at Walmart, Target, Costcos etc. I went to purchase James Pattersons new book because l could get it at a pre-release price of $8.99 as the book would be released on February 2, 2010. When l purchased the book, the receipt said l would get the book May 2, 2010. Is there some kind law that says one must wait and extra three months for electronic books or is this a scam. I can not tell you how disappointed l am. Was so looking forward to using the product, but will only use it when l travel. There is no other reason to use it other than not having to carry 10-15 books with me."
5,it help me,This book will help u get to your stages u want to get to. Some of the tricks you have to do on bigger jumps because you have to get more air time but build up slowly on ramps and get into bigger tricks.You never know you might be in the x games or gravity games.
4,Gooseneck Diverter Faucet with hand shower for clawfoot tub.,I have an old clawfoot tub from the early 1900's that I had refinished and needed to find a faucet that would match its style. The satin nickel finish on this faucet is lovely and matches the other fixtures in the room very well. I love the antique telephone style. It fits the tub beautifully. It's easy to use and comfortable to hold. The handles are easy to operate and the transition from filler faucet to shower head is smooth.There was a small problem installing it because my supply lines didn't fiit the faucets. The local big box hardware store didn't have lines with those measurements in stock but it did have adaptors so all was well. Other than that the installation was very easy.
3,Beginner level in the series,I first got NO.4 in the series and liked the album a lot. Then I got this first one which turned out to be a dissapointment. The style is different and vocals are used in many of the songs in this album. But it is simply not as enjoyable as 4. I suspect the music gets better as the series goes.
5,Awesome,"What an incredible movie that deserves nothing less than five stars. It's a deeply moving and affecting experience. It's very realistic and true-to-life. Hanks is flawless as are his supporting cast. A number of themes come through here including the importance of not taking things for granted. Why do we all feel as though we have to live and die by the clock? Everything we have can be taken away from us at any moment. I enjoyed this movie, strangely enough, considerably more the second time I watched it about three years after its release. It is sooo enjoyable and you are riveted from the instant the plane is in trouble. Zemeckis is a genius and he and Hanks are greatest team in Hollywood ie) Forrest Gump??I believe it's impossible for someone to say they did not enjoy this movie and if it didn't create emotion within yourself then there is something wrong with you This movie IS that good, even though it may be difficult to watch at times. Great, epic movie."
2,Not everyone will find it funny.,This film is a situation comedy based on laughing at people in awkward situations. If you have a taste for that kind of thing than this movie is for you. Otherwise forget it.
5,So Good!,This product is AMAZING! My daughter and I split this package as a fun make it yourself lunch! I didn't even get to the chicken I had planned to put in this! I used cucumbers and a broccoli slaw mixture. They were messy but SO good. Highly recomend. The removal of the MSG is an awesome thing! Thanks Annie Chun's.
1,"Over hyped, overwritten - a Big Bore","I am a quarter through the book and still there is little story, just endless description of places and long-winded letters written by a self-indulgent academic. The main characters are made of cardboard. Nothing in their heads (or any other part of their anatomy) except the research. What a waste of money - and trees."
3,It was okay,I wasn't a big fan of this one.I liked Jet Li but was disappointed by the absence of Rachel Weisz
3,British Blood and Black Humour,"I had seen this movie as a child and it left quite an impression on me. Recently finding it on VHS was a joy, and it's held up over the years. Mind you, I have a LOVE of the lurid hodgepodge of genres that some of those Brit ""horror"" films were. This is camp and cheese and still quite enjoyable. The wah-wah-guitar soundtrack music, the bizarre images, the so-AWFUL-it's-great folk song burial sequence... The humour is sort of a low-rent version of DR. PHIBES, and well worth checking out, I think..."
2,Could be better,Not my favorite movie. I would never ever recommend this movie to anyone ever ever ever ever ever. I didn't watch the whole thing.
5,Awesome.,"I adore the Sony PSP headphone (with remote) and having them in black is even better. Looks great, sounds great, feels great. Makes every game I play sound optimal. The PSP has excellent audio output and these headphones let you know it."
3,READ THE DIMENSIONS!!...but cute little book,Book was a fun addition to a beer-themed gift! But i also did not read the reviews nor the dimensions I assumed the book was full sized not stocking stuffer size....my fault though not the sellers ...good for a college kid. or the person who always has a beer in thier hand.
5,Great language based activities for any child,"Being a teacher myself, I was very impressed with the language based activities in this book. Even if you were not to do the ASL and just do the activities to help your child learn English, they would be great activities. This is important to me since my daughter is HOH (hard of hearing) and I want to make sure I am not only teaching her ASL, but also exposing her to lots and lots of English at the same time.I am currently trying to figure out how to get trained to be a Signing Smart instructor since there are none in my area; this shows how impressed I am with this book.With this book and our Signing Time! videos, we are quickly learning many signs. My 8 month old is just starting to sign ""more"" and ""eat"" and ""milk""."
1,Turned me off zen completely!,"If I ever had any interest in Zen, this book would squash it! Anderson goes on about how wonderful it is to put the spoons a certain way in the gomasio bowl, and yet when talking about the problems with Richard Baker, comes across as never having the courage to confront him. Maybe he was too busy setting the spoons the right way in the gomasio bowl and holding arcane precepts ceremonies to actually consider how the precepts might work in actual life."
3,too few visual aids,I bought this book to teach myself how to recognize some of the main trees that I see around me.I have not found it very useful. The lack of visual aids makes it difficult for someone who is just learning to figure his way around. An image is worth a thousand words... and this book appeals much more to words than to images.
4,Fun Game,"I bought this game for my teenager for Christmas. He absolutely loves this game. Now I can't get my husband away from it either! What I like is there isn't the gore, swearing, etc. in other kinds of games like this. Although the characters say the same thing over and over which gets a bit annoying. But like I said, a really good game."
1,"A Few, Minor Mistakes?","This is a book about Gettysburg that identifies a photograph of Brig. Gen. Edwin H. Stoughton, who was noteven at Gettysburg, as Joshua L. Chamberlain of the 20th Maine Regiment, hero of the novel ""The Killer Angels"" andfamously portrayed in the movie ""Gettysburg"". There is a lot of information between the covers of this creation; it's just not reliable. Wake up and smell the coffee ...."
3,Not for older kids...,"If you can get past the first 15 minutes of idiotic cartoon banter, this DVD has a little bit of very basic information for actually playing football. Younger kids (8 and under) will probably like it, but older kids will be bored."
4,Good Product,This was a good product. I purchased it to to go along with my wedding gown. It arrived within a week of the order and it's exactly what I needed.
5,"Ok men, get ready to make your woman drool!!!!","Men, if you love your woman, get this book. Not only with you be pleased with the responses you will get from her, but she will go CRAZY. This book has it all. Lou Paget has been in this business for years, and im very glad that she finally made a book for us guys. For years, she told girls how to please us, and we were left in the dark with how to make their eyes roll in the back of their head. Well here it is.In this book we get diagrams of different girls vaginas and it goes into how each one is different, and how to please each kind. Its great.Thats right, before the sex even starts.Dont pass this up guys."
5,Absolutely astounding!,"This little blue box will explode your sound outward, upward, and around you--bringing back missing frequencies, expanding the stereo image, and maximizing the signal-to-noise. The Surround system is extremely good, particularly the Dialog Enhancement feature which works to make center-mic'd things clearer and more focused. It's great for DVDs, but where it really shines is in the music department. With a set of Altec Lansing ATP3s, I was astounded by the clarity and forcefulness suddenly present in every note... and hooked up to my stereo, a JVC MX-GT80, the result was absolutely ASTOUNDING-- crystal-clear through every possible frequency imaginable. In short, it has turned my modest computer speakers into absolutely extraordinary powerhouses of sound, and my $350 stereo system into one of the most astounding... OBJECTS... I have ever heard.This thing rocks."
3,"Cute, but not captivating",The price was ok for the product. I wish it would have had more talking elements to it (I guess I should have looked at Handy Manny) than just the Bob square. My 18 month old hardly picks up the pieces other than Bob's face. It's sturdy and a good first tool set.
3,"Same story, different title!","Well, I have now read all three of Sue Margolis' books - I really enjoyed Neurotica, but Spin Cycle and now Apocalipstick are just so-so. This one felt so similiar to the other two - the main character, spunky single woman, either has a sexually dysfunctional partner, or KNOWS someone with a sexually dysfunctional partner. She has some predictable flings (I almost laughed when they broke out the oil yet again during one of their ""intimate moments"". Oil was rubbed into her buttocks in each of the other two books. Hmmmm, must be an English thing, I guess). It was also odd that everytime someone cried in this book it was ""a single tear rolled down her cheek"" - I kid you not, this happened EVERY time! This book just felt like it was being churned out and not written; it wasn't very original."
3,Good But....Not as good...,"It's gonna be very hard for Jason to top his debut CD or at least to me. I have over 400 CD's and Jason Aldeans 1st CD is the very best I have, so I could be a little bias. However this CD is definately worth buying. It's really good with lots of different emotions, slow songs, rockabilly and songs that pull on your heart strings. I am a hugh Jason Aldean fan and I'll buy whatever he releases. I've been patiently awaiting this release and ran out immediately and got it. It's really good but not as good as his debut cd.Go ahead, buy it, you'll like it!"
5,Jeanjo,A wonderful way to start the day. Was recommended to me by a friend who is using it again for the third year in a row. Scripture and short devotional always seem relevant to where I am in my life each day. Highly recommend to anyone who only has about ten minutes each morning for devotional time.Jesus Calling: Enjoying Peace in His Presence
2,I spent a lot of time fast forwarding through most of it,"The basis of the movie revolves around a succession of bizarre events when Andrew returns to his hometown in New Jersey for his mother's funeral after being gone for 10 years.Other than that, I guess I must have missed the main message. - or I must have been heavily medicated like the main character.Overall I would say the story (one of self-discovery) was OK, the acting was good and Natalie Portman played a believable character. The chemistry between the two main characters is what holds the whole thing together.I spent a lot of time fast forwarding through most of it thou,There are a few funny parts mixed in - like the scene with the hamster cemetery. but that's about it.Maybe rent it or borrow it from a friend"
3,"Yes, Again!","Mayle makes his third journey to Provence and the idea is wearing a little thin.Still a page turner but definitely lacks the ""joie de vivre"" of the first two books. Too much Mayle and not enough people of Provence."
2,Horrendous sound quality and production!,"Tough love from a major Waterboys fan: Will someone please steal the master tapes, pro-tools, etc. of this CD from Mike Scott and remix it! It is harshly distorted--musically and vocally, which ruins the bulk of the songs. Whoever introduced Mike Scott to singing through a micro-synth should get the death penalty. And the pronounced Irish affectations in his voice have reached their preposterous zenith. Half the songs on here would be decent if they were stripped down to basics and cut shorter by 3 minutes (not every coda is worthy of Hey Jude treatment). If you are a new fan, stick with Mike Scott's Still Burning and the Waterboy's first 4 CD's. This is for aural masochists only!"
2,"Good dustpan, impossible-to-remove sticker","Not shown in the picture is a huge, 4"" x 6"" sticker that comes on the dust pan that is of the cheap, never-comes-off-in-one-piece type. It is put on in such a way that you really have to remove it to use the item. Its just a dustpan, but if you make something with a sticker that is meant to be removed before use, you should really use a sticker that actually can be removed.Otherwise, nice dustpan."
2,So-so,"Okay to rent if you have seen everything else. As Dorothy Parker once said about another actress, and which I will paraphrase and adapt,""Stewart runs the gamut of emotions from A to B."" She brought the rest of the movie down to her own deadpan level. There was almost zero chemistry between her and Hemsworth. Charlize Theron, as far as she was able to, added to the overall movie, but she can't do it alone."
1,BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I was going to use TAX CUT this year but, they had just put it on the shelves and didn't lower the price yet so I chose TurboTax for the sixth year in a row. When my computer hard disk had errors, I upgraded. It took me over 20 minutes of online help with intuit to reactivate the software, they kept asking circular questions. Based on this customer service I will not use the software next year."
4,An OK book in an AMAZING Series,"OK, so maybe it wasn't as good as the Ersatz Elevator, or the Reptile Room, or the Wide Window, but it was still an A- book!The start of the series most likely is the worse, but still good. This book is the shortest, so I'd reccomend it to a little kid whose just started reading fine realistic fiction, or a person who just wants to read a new series of books to have something to read. This series is definately better if you read it in order, but it's still good if you don't. I myself read the books in this order-3,9,4,5,10,1,2,6,7,8. Basically, I'd reccomend this book to any teachers wanting their kids learning new words and phrases (Snicket is very good at that), and also for people who want a very funny book.hope this helped"
3,I'm only doing this for homework,"The scene that I liked the most was when Cyd fell in love woth Louis. It was realli cute in a way on how Cyd flirted with him and made him attracted to her.The characters in this story...from what I think was well thought of.I have no kind of personal connection with any of these characters...none are really like me.The only thing I didn't like about this book was on how Rachel had talked about the GAY situation. The gay part just bothers me.I don't get on how gay people are accepted, like as a part of life. If I had a gay brother, i would of probably of murdered him.Cyd is a funnt (well,sort of) and attractive girl."
5,clean white,I recieved this watch on time. This watch is so clean and white i love it. Very simple and stylish. Straps are very comfortable where i can't even feel a thing.
1,Do not buy,This book will not help you draw people. There is no instruction. this book is compiled of hundreds of sketches from exercise videos and porn. The drawings are mediocre and are not good to learn from. If your serious about learning figure drawing check out Prudhon and Anthony Ryder. Don't waste your money on this book.
2,meh.,"it's a shame.but, hey, it's the 'logical progession' theory in affect.ToD's been getting better every release, this is the first where they don't. sadly, the lack of Neil Busch seems to have made the band think that they're some sort of prog-rawk band...it's sad that this band, esp. after ST&C;'s would release something so...bland and seemingly uninspired."
4,Exciting,Found WantingThis was an exciting action filled book with a great heroine. This was a page turner. It would make a good movie.
2,Ughhh Should Forget this one!,Ok...It is usually easy For me to get started on a book..This was the worst!!!..It didnt grab me at all...I picked up and put it down 10 times within a week...I would definately FORGET this one...Try Bad things...or Haunted..Much better reads!
3,"Three stars, but just barely","Like most readers, I rather liked Justin, although he sometimes seemed undependable (he had promised her father to take care of her) and a bit wimpy. His musical talent was a delightful characteristic. It seemed odd, however, that he found it so easy to adjust to being a Duke after so many years in New Zealand. Emily is often annoying; she has spirit and strength, but she is immature and mercurial. Their relationship did sometimes have moments of unseemliness, of ""ickiness.""The book started well, but dragged later on. The ending left far too many questions still unanswered. As a whole, unsatisfactory. Only Medeiros' ability to write beautifully, to evoke emotion, and to effectively evoke a setting raises this attempt to a three-star level. For plot and characters alone, it's only 2 stars."
5,Great Product,"Rx Nutrition is a great product. I learned many new things about nutrition that I've never heard before. The DVD provides instruction on when to eat, how much to eat, and the proper combination of foods (carbs, protein, fat).The DVD also provides valuable information on how to properly fuel your body for exercise. Food for exercise is in addition to your normal food! The DVD gives recipes and advice for the types of food to consume before, during and after exercise.I highly recommend this product for anyone who struggles with weight and/or the athlete who want to optimize their athletic performance.Thanks Dr. Rick Kattouf for producing a great instructional video!"
4,Help when the going is tough,"Even Christans can become dicouraged, and Jerry Bridges paints a series of pictures with which any person who has doubted the love of God during a crisis can identify. His explanation of the sovereignty of God cannot fail to encourage those who are in the depths of despair over the loss of a loved one, who are in the midst of a serious illness or who have been disappointed by the actions of others. Unlike many other books in a similiar vein, Mr Bridges backs up his points with scripture - the final authority for a Christian."
5,A Valuable Crack-up!,"Lovers of Silverstein will cheer for this munny and fixed-up book! Only his cleverness could concieve of this original poetry. I think this title could win over non-poets, especially if challanged to read the book aloud! I couldn't believe how many times my brain tried to switch the letters back. This book is utterly readable and utterly original. What else could we expect from the beloved Shel Silvertein?"
5,Great Product - Excellent Value,"We purchased this microphone for use at our church. It works perfectly, sounds great, and was a steal for 20 bucks!"
3,Cosmopolitan......a lil' like neopolitan.,Having a copy of Cosmopolitan Magazine available allows for short reads for short time periods. Cosmopolitan has a wide variety; something for everyone....a lil like neopolitan. Great as a time filler while you are waiting.
4,Not bad,"Its much better than I thought. It has song from the first predator movie. Most of the songs have a nice carribean beat into the songs. It gets tiring after the seventh song though. The best songs are Main Title,Tunnel Chase,Danny Gets It,This Is History and End Title . The rest of the songs were lame."
2,review for pablo,"Not one of my favorite translations. Sounds a lot better trying to read it in Spanish. It is not so much translation, but i feel there could have been a better topic or another author that could be translated."
2,Laser went out on mine . . . customer service is HORRIBLE!!!,"nice player for about 3 months then dvd's stopped playing. player was under parts warranty but just out of labor - so brand new laser cost me (for) labor and the part (...) was jvc's responsibility. they've had it now for 2 weeks, and no sign of getting it back soon. their customer support is terrible. i've been transferred and referred to 3 different locations, all of which knew absolutely nothing about the problem. i finally got to a customer service representative manager who is supposedly rushing the player through service. my daughter is about to have a cow since she can't watch her shrek dvd . . .i have no idea about other companies (sony, panasonic, toshiba, etc.) customer support, but i should've waited until outlaw audio releases their dvd player (the best customer service in the business!)"
2,Almost Obsolute?,"Not really made for siding. It is big and heavy. I could only special order nails which were thicker then regular siding nails and cost about three times as much. Home depot, Lowes, and Amazon do not carry siding nails for it. I couldn't even get framing nails for it in my area. Although Amazon carries two types of framing nails. It is a good gun to build crates as long as you can find nails for it. It is ok for framing. But, framers use stick nailers."
1,Sad,"Sam's book illuminates why Air America is a failure and why the Left and Liberalism is dieng in America. Thank God! The only followers they have ""left"" are the mentally ill and drug addicted. This book was too poorly written and amaturish to be interesting. Cheap attempts at humor and thoughtless ranting and hysteria. Pretty typical for democrats these days. Don't waste your time or money."
4,Good shaver,"Not much to report - the price is good, and it works just fine. All the controls are easy to use and it's comfortable. The only downside is there's no vacuum to suck up the whiskers, but models with that feature are more expensive."
4,Belmo's Books,I already have all of Bemo's other books and I think they're all great. My fave is THE BEATLES-NOT FOR SALE. Very detailed. PSYCHEDELIA is a great look at an era/genre of music created when the world was changing and one of the main reasons for this change was the music.
2,Beginners BEWARE,"I am a published novelist with good reviews, and I got there in large part by reading every book about writing that I could get my hands on. This one offers some limited value for people who already have a solid grasp on the basics, but if you are a beginner, I would advise you to skip this book, at least until you've read quite a few others. And get it from your library rather than spending money on it. Starting with the fact that the author incorrectly explains first/second/third person to the premise that your novel must start with a premise (to insist on starting with one may cripple and oversimplify your book, if you are lucky enough to not have it turn into an unpublishable sermon)...Approach with caution. I believe the best advice is to read a lot of books on writing so you can pick and choose what elements you think will work best for you from the various approaches out there."
2,This is why sequels SUCK!!!,"BTTF part II is a poor followup to Back To The Future. All the charm, warmth and humor of Back To The Future isn't here. The plot is convoluted and unpleasant and the acting isn't as good as Back To The Future. Michael J Fox clearly has lost all his 80's charm. He is in no way as appealing as he was in Back To The Future."
4,Old time boogie,"This compilation appears to start out in chrono order. Disk 4 is more big band style. Some songs are duplicates of others on the set. Some covers of more famous versions but mostly original. Very low background noise. This set lets you hear how it started out and influenced the later artists that we have now in blues/rockabilly and other genres of music. The production isn't as good as today, but it's still worth the cost to hear what the early pioneers did with the tunes."
5,An important glimpse into the world of children living with aspergers,"If you want to understand what a child with asperger's might act like, this is the video for you! I was very impressed with the story of three boys living with asperger's. Each one had his own unique fixation and their openess and honesty about their disability was refreshing to watch!I would recommend this video to anyone wanting to know more about what asperger's really is like. Kudos to the kids!"
4,Of the three,"Of the three very good books I've recently read (Bark of the Dogwood, Purpose Driven Life and this one) The Notebook is the best, followed by the ""Dogwood"" book. This Sparks novel is not what I'd generally warm to, but I went into the reading with both eyes opened. Short and sweet."
1,Deceiving picture of a different item!,Besides the fact that I received a completely different item than what the picture led me to believe I was going to receive - this adapter does not even work properly with my Sony Ericsson K800i !Will return or request a refund!
2,Neither subtitles nor libretto!,"I have to agree with the previous reviews but gave it 2 stars because the performance was actually quite good. Amazon should be more careful about getting the product information correct. If anyone ""googles"" the title, there is a libretto (auf deutsch) available on line for those of us who read German but forget the web transliteration. Anyway, enjoy it if you have it and if you don't, do some research ahead of time to see if you can locate a libretto copy with an English translation."
5,Must Have,This guy knows more about how to heal the Planet than the rest of Humanity combined. Four More Words - Ridiculous!
1,I got fooled,"I was trying to buy the 3 CD Box set. Instead, I got one CD with the same name as the box set."
5,The most believable Hamlet,"I teach Shakespeare classes to adults and have a personal collection of seven VHS and DVD versions of Hamlet. Campbell Scott is by far the most believable, and my students have chosen it as their favorite version. Claudius is pefect--a smiling smiling villain absolutely capable of secucing his sister-in-law and murdering his brother. The casting of Polonius, Ophelia and Laertes worked well. The second choice of my students is the Mel Gibson, which had been number one until they saw Campbell Scott. The scene in the room where they have stored away all reminders of the old king is brilliant. Great film."
2,Sometimes It's Not About Horror...,"If you watch this movie in hopes of coming across a truly misunderstood horror gem...then you will be terribly disappointed. The acting is weak, the plot is riddled with holes and was obviously thrown together in five minutes, the make-up and effects (if you can call them that) are just plain silly. But still, this movie is worth watching. Why? Heather Elizabeth Parkhurst and Stella Stevens, of course! Gorgeous and seductive, Parkhurst is lovely to look at, and with her cheesy one-liners and badly applied make-up, Stella Stevens is hilarious! Highlights include the wrestling addicted nephew and the ""Melting scene"" of Wolfgang the Cat. Seriously."
2,Get what you pay for...,"Is $85 too good to be true? Sadly, yes. The pictures look great for this watch, but once you actually inspect it in your hands, it doesn't hold up. First off, the ""cyclops"" magnifier on the crystal hardly magnifies at all. I don't know what the specs are on this, but the date font looks as if it gets enlarged by 15% tops.The worst part of this watch is the bracelet. Again, it looks pretty in the pictures, but it feels tinny, light, and cheap once you feel it in your hands.Basically, this watch is worth $85, and if that's what you were looking for, that's great. I was expecting something more Rolex-like-- a heavier weight and more functional date magnifier. If you're looking to get a better value, I'd check out the Seiko monster."
2,The Book is ok!!!!!!!!,"I think the book is ok, in the begining it is very boring and confusing, but in the middle of thr book it gets very good.I really hate the ending of the book..........:("
4,Its a good starter Lens,"OK..Its a very good starter lens. But more and more I learned, I started finding flaws with it.But as a starter lens when it came with my 7D as a bundle for #230 more, It was worth getting it. But if you are going to pay full price of over $380, Avoid and get an L lens for a bit more.Pros:- It was only $250 since it came as a Kit.- It takes good overall pictures as a walk around lens. The colors and contrast are spectacularCons:The Build is shakey/Loose/creeps...- At 28mm, The kit lens 17-35 is sharper on the edges. Yes. I compared. The edges on the 28-135 at 28 with the Kit 17-55mm lens and the 28-135mm lens is downright blurry.- Some CA (Chromatic Abberation) but this can be removed in PP using Lightroom software."
3,Great Starter Game,"I have an Eight Year Old, Six year old and a Four year old. They are all big Scooby Doo fans and they love this game. They are probably not representative of hard core game players, because they only played PC games before and we are new to PS2.However, the ""feel"" of this game is that you are in a Scooby Doo episode, complete with jokes and canned laughter. As it is a learning experience for all of us, it is taking time to get through the game, so they are not growing bored with it quickly.At times the game can seem a little slow, too much dialogue and not enough action, and I can see that becoming a problem in future.But, for the moment, it is fun. It is very much aimed at young children, with no adult language or themes, no blood, guts or murder. All in all I think it was a good purchase to get the kids into PS2 games."
4,Red is Ravin',"Painting it Red is one the best Beautiful South albums so far. I was a bit dissapointed in Quench but they have come back with a bang! I saw them live at the MEN last year, and am going again in December. If this album is anything to go by we should be in for a brilliant night!"
1,Very Disapointed,"I got Bobby Fischer's book thinking it had good lessons like a teacher would have. Instead it is a bunch of simple checkmate positions that are easy to solve - one page and one position! Junk! Total junk. I should have read the other reviews that pointed this out before getting the book. I have the book ""Simple checkmates"" which is much, much better if you want a book on ""simple checkmates"". Checkmate is the end result of a hard contest and is not what I need to learn."
4,"Very good, but not perfect","I love my mixer, but there's 2 drawbacks. One, when it's kneading dough for a period of time, you have to watch to make sure the little round metal bar that functions as the hinge between the top and the bottom of the mixer doesn't vibrate loose. It would be better if that was more permanently attached. I have to sometimes physically keep a finger on it so that it doesn't vibrate loose.Two, when mixing, the beater attachment doesn't quite get to the very bottom of the bowl. When I make cookies, I have to stop the machine at least once to use a spatula to stir up the bottom to make sure it gets mixed in properly.On the positive side, it's of course a very solid machine and still runs as good today as when I bought it 3 years ago."
3,SPOILER ALERT - the ending makes no sense,"SPOILER ALERT - Please do not read this review if you have not yet read the novel ""Moonraker.""This review contains serious spoilers.SPOILERS!!!!!!If Hugo Drax has an atomic warhead, why does he need a rocket if he wants to blow up London? Why not just put the warhead in the back of a truck, drive it down the road to London, and leave it with a timer to set it to go off in 12 hours.What's the point of going to all the trouble and expense of building a huge and costly untested rocket to take a bomb up into the air, when the intent is that it will come right back down a few hours' drive from where you launched it?Aside from the fact that building to rocket to deliver the warhead made no damn sense at all, this is a terrifically entertaing book."
5,Great little mic,"I adore this mic. I was stoked to see the packaging it came in too. This mic wants to save the world.I needed a mic for my Mac Pro... mainly for google voice. I have a 27 inch LED display so the mic on this thing isn't that great. Now when I talk to people, they don't feel like they are on speakerphone.My only complaint is that I wish it looked a little closer to Bob Barkers mic. I almost feel like him when I talk into it!"
5,Great Choice,"I have taken shots outdoor as well as indoor with this camera. The picture quality often compares that from my DSLR when I am shooting outdoors. The colors are saturated and edges are sharp.I also think that this camera gives the best quality for indoor shots from a P&S.; You can safely shoot at ISO 800 and with a little photoshop noise reduction, the pictures are perfectly usable."
2,Unhappy with substitutions for order,"i ordered 5 1000 piece puzzles with my gift certificate. On one of them ( grand canyon by national landmarks the 550 piece was substituted, but not in price but list included with shipping said it was 1000 piece). It is too much trouble to send back and get what I ordered. [...].Peace, Kathy McGill"
1,predictable and preposterous,"If you want to waste time reading a book you've read before--probably many times before--then this one is for you. It's 600+ pages of formulas and cliches. All-powerful industrialists conspiring to rule the world. The high-tech creation of a new master race. A one-man rescue and destruction of the Evil Empire ensconed in an impregnable Alpine castle. A mind-numbing progression of traps, blackmail and false identities, all of which are easily anticipated by the reader (but not by our heroes). This book has it all--unfortunately."
5,Sit Back And Enjoy The Ride!,"A classic 1977 moonshine film (others include Moonshine County Express, a must for future DVD release with John Saxon, William Conrad, Albert Salmi Susan Howard, Claudia Jennings and Maureen McCormick).The DVD includes both full screen and wide screen presentation and the print is amazing quality. Everyone does an excellent job and it is one of those films where you like the 'bad guys' as much as the 'good guys'. David Carradine and Kate Jackson make a likeable duo and Roger C Carmel has fun with his role as does George Murdock and Charles Napier. Also look for Sterling Holloway as one of old time moonshiners. In all a fun filled romp for all."
1,"for older kids, not younger ones","My daughter, 8, bought this movie as a part of a DVD collection called ""Benji's Favorite Dog Tales."" It had a grandfather dying, a pet dog who catches rabies, an infected cut treated with maggots, a teenage boy arrested, etc... Definitely not for 8 year olds. And, definitely not ""Benji's favorite"" either. My daughter says that this was a horrible movie. To the manufacturer's credit, we have since noticed the PG rating on the back. But, who would look for a rating on a ""Benji"" movie?"
3,Too large in bust =/,"The corset is beautiful, really sturdy and well made. Although, the photo does show a straight cut across the top, while the actual product has more of a sweetheart neckline instead--still, very pretty, and this is not my main complaint. The issue is that it's very loose in the bust. I am a 32 C, and since a 32 is the smallest size available (and another review stated that ordering a size smaller hadn't worked for them), that is what I ordered. I have the back synched as tightly as possible without the edges overlapping and wore a strapless pushup bra underneath, and there is still quite a bit of space in the bust. It fits the rest of me well enough (still a bit big), and a size down probably would have been best if it were available."
5,New Batteries Fix the Faded Label Issue,"I like this label maker. It is fast, easy to use, portable and has a variety of options for refill labels.I was getting the faded label issue but I tried fresh batteries and the labels look perfect again.It takes four AA batteries. There is also a spot to plug in an AC adapter, but the version I bought at Target did not include the adapter. It's fine without the adapter, as long as you have fresh, or freshly recharged, AA batteries on hand."
3,"A bit overpriced, more on the IDE than VB .NET","My first thought, after seeing this book, was what a small book for 40 bucks. After thumbing through the pages, I still think it is a bit small, but I am more impressed with its content.This book, much like ""Designing Visual Basic.NET Applications"", is as much a book on the Visual Studio .NET IDE as it is on Visual Basic .NET. Unlike the aforementioned tome, this book has plenty of screenshots to help you navigate the IDE.In all fairness, there is a good amount of code in this book, for its size. I just wish there were more. If you are looking for an advanced book, look the other way.The saving grace of this book is its help in navigating the Visual Studio .NET IDE. If you want to learn the tool as much as you want to learn the language, this is not a bad buy. For books in this price range the O'Reilly Nutshell book is much better."
5,For Brent,This LP was in Brent Grulke's album collection. Brent was instrumental in bringing Springsteen to be the keynote speaker at SXSW 2012. The Springsteen keynote was like going to rock-n-roll church.
5,Nice product..,I haven't used these yet because I haven't had time but I am sure this is a good product..I can't wait for the holidays to be over so I can enjoy..
1,Stink-o DVD !!!,"Boy! Compare the picture quality of this movie to the episodes of the original shows that Paramount is releasing. Star Trek IV is grainy, and has a soft focus. Why couldn't Paramount had gone back and cleaned up the image of it's Star Trek movies, to look as good as the episodes? As for the film, it is a fun adventure about the preciousness of life. Too bad you can not enjoy it due to Paramount's lazy treatment of it's presentation on DVD..."
5,Excellent,The book is alphabetically organised which is just so practical and easy to use. It explains things in an easy to understand English. I couldn't teach without it. Invaluable! Excellent buy!!!!
3,So so...,"Perhaps if I had not read any of Nancy Bell's Biggie series, I would have liked this better, but it is inevitable that one would compare this with the charming Biggie books. Judge Crain just isn't very interesting--if I must tell the truth--and the town is not so much fun as Job's Crossing. The plot is only OK, but plot is not the most important or noticeable ingredient in a Nancy Bell book. I kept having the sense that I had seen all this before in Lilian Jackson Braun's cat books. I do hope the writer will end the Judge Crain series and return to Biggie's adventures."
2,Huh?,"I guess I must agree with some of the principles he has in his book. Some are a little confusing if you aren't educated in money lingo. I must say I'm tired of authors using ""middle"" income brackets as their examples. $54,000???? As a teacher, I'll be lucky to see that much in 35 years."
3,"You get, what you pay for.","The buying and shipping process was great, the product not so much. The Shofar is not accurately portrayed in the picture,the Shofar pictured is a black and polished ram horn, and the one I got was natural and polished ivory white. It is a very basic Shofar. Mine did come in at 12 inches so the measurement is accurate. It also came with a cut on the top of the Shofar, that looks like it was a manufacture error. I was hesitant about buying a Shofar online, and I'm even more hesitant now."
1,Forget It.,"Not knowing exactly what Blum hinge to use, I went to the Blum US site. I found this site totally devoid of any information for the prospective customer. It's like they don't want to share that information. They don't deserve to be in business."
5,Wonderful,This book is a wonderful way for children to express their thoughts and feelings about dying. This book can be used before the death of a loved one. I bought two of these books for a friend whose husband is dying and they have two young children. They love the books and using art therapy has helped these children to express what they are thinking and feeling.
4,This products clears up acne quickly. Great product....,This products clears up acne quickly. Great product.
3,The suds are thick this season!,"I loved season 1, but season 2 had so much soap opera melodrama, it was almost laughable . From the officer impregnating the house maid to Matthew' s ""Miraculous"" cure so he was no longer crippled, to Lavinia' s ""convenient death from the Spanish flu, I thought I was watching a Mexican reflexively . excessively cornet!"
5,Amazing dartboard,"This is an awesome dart board! I wouldn't get a diff. one, the cricket view is great you can see it from a good distance away.I am really enjoying this product!"
4,What the ancients thought about gender is important- buy it.,This is your chance to replace rumor and speculation with fact. How may times have you over-heard some Blow Hard go on and on at a cocktail party about how masculinity was expressed and thought of in Classical Times and wondered just how much of a blow hard he might REALLY be? Buy this good book to find out (The hard back is simply but beautifully bound too.)
5,Perfect for my office.,These wire baskets work perfect in my office. They are deep enough to hold books and papers and I like the fact that I can see what items are in the basket even if they are at the bottom.
2,One-sided and simplistic account of Bosnian war,"Peter Maas' book is certainly fast-paced, exciting and full of interesting anecdotes from the war in Bosnia. However, it's also a very simplistic and one-sided description of the Bosnian war, casting Serbia and the Serbs as nationalistic aggressors and the Muslims and Croats as innocent victims. Maas fails to mention that ethnic cleansing, torture of prisoners, massacres of civilians and political manipulation was also perpetrated by the Croatian and Muslim, factions in this brutal civil war. In place of any real analysis of the causes, events and results of the war Maas gives the reader emotionally gripping anecdotes. Rather than describing the complicated reality of the war he prefers to present it as a clear cut case of 'good guys' vs 'bad guys'. In many ways, this book is very typical of US media accounts of the Bosnian civil war in that it is very obviously written from a Muslim point of view. -Oskar-"
1,Not a good resource,"I have used quite a few ""Intro to"" books to learn various applications, and this one is at the bottom of the list. Granted, some of this may be due to the fact that I'm not overly enamored with QuarkXPress itself, but this book does it no favors. Information is not organized well,and the index isn't helpful.In short, the book doesn't do a good job of teaching Quark as a whole, AND if you are looking for help on a particular topic, its almost impossible to find. Now, to be fair I haven't read some of the other Quark books, so they may all have this problem, but I found this book to be below the standards of other training books I've used in the past."
3,Interesting read but struggles for consistent tone,"I was so encouraged by the first chapter. The vision of plastic surgeon trainees working on cadaver heads as an erstwhile ""mask factory"" had me chuckling aloud. Perhaps the book should have stopped there as a magazine article.The book doesn't know whether it is serious or humorous, whether it is history or satire. Obviously reluctant to make any humor at the expense of victims of plane crashes, the author does a complete change of tone in a chapter about how causes of death can be gleaned from the condition of bodies. That's all fine and good but it was like not even reading the same book. STIFF gets derailed at that point and never gets back on track... wandering between science and humor but without much focus as to either.Not a waste of time, but a disappointment given its apparent promise."
5,Three Great Novels in One Edition,"Karen Kingsbury is a favorite author of mine. She writes truly life-changing inspirational fiction. You can't beat getting three of her novels in one edition.Where Yesterday LivesEllen returns to her childhood home after her father's death. She tries to make peace with people and events from her past. Ellen has no idea what God has in store for her.When Joy Came to StayMaggie and her family are on an uncertain journey with depression and all that comes with it. Faith in God will see them through. Having lived with clinicaldepression my whole life, this one really hit home.On Every SideFaith is a young woman who must make a stand for the truth of God in our uncertain world.I highly recommend purchasing this nicely-priced book.I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review."
2,Darren d.,THE INCREDIBLE HULK RETURNS/ THE TRIAL OF THE INCREDIBLE. GOOD PRICE`S FOR 2 ON one dvd.the returns was ok thy show more of tor then the the hulk and when it come to the fighting the hulk work`s a lone not with tor. but it was ok?.the trial of the hulk was ok as well but he did not go to trial. so why did thy call it that?.thank you.
3,"Good writing, but....","First off, I should say that the writing is excellent. You won't have any problem following the story. As another reviewer stated, she does have a way with ""lush texture"". I have to disagree with the statement that the reader is anxious to learn the outcome. You can pretty much tell the outcome after the first couple of chapters. The best part of the book is the end in which the everything is finally revealed, but aside from the character, you should have pretty much figured everything out long before you get to this point. If you need a book that you don't want to get too involved in and don't want to spend more than a few hours on, this book is for you!"
1,Live or ...,"I will disagree with everyone else on the planet on this one and I do like Roy Orbison.As good as the band was there should have been more sparks in this DVD rather than almost none. The sparks that were there seemed to me almost scripted.I got the distinct impression that the set was completely re-recorded. If that was the case all blemishes can be removed. Now, of course, with that line up one would hardly think that there would be a mistake. So we might not know what happened during the filming, afterwards or, in this case, how much happened afterwards.Yes, the sound was great but all films go in for a mix and one would hope that the director and music producer would take the time needed to make this one sound good.So yes it was/is a historic film but it does, at least for me, raise a few questions."
1,Please people....,"no ""To Cry You A Song""?1 StarHow do you edit a 40 minute song into 3 minutes?Buy the early CD's... Tull is not a ""singles"" band."
2,Useful but filled with errors.,"If you are new to website construction and are considering Adobe GoLive CS Classroom in a book (REVISED EDITION)as a reference guide...beware!How could a revised edition still have so many errors (especially as found in Chapter 9), shame on you Adobe Systems.So much of the web design industry has gone to Dreamweaver, that I wonder if Adobe has lost interest in maintaining an adaquate level of support for this product...and now we hear that Adobe has just purchased Macromedia."
5,Deep Comfort,"A landmark work of healing for those facing life-threatening illness. Graceful Passages is a work of the highest integrity that provides the deep comfort and solace of wise words and heart opening music for the often uncharted waters of attending the dying. By featuring the voices of Elizabeth Kubler-Ross, Zalman Schachter-Shalomi and the others, it provides soothing support offered by a whole sacred circle of mentor guides available at any hour of need."
2,This book delivers what it promises.,"I can hear Steve Martin's carefully timed delivery in each paragraph. I can see the (fake) arrow through his head and hear the beat of Egyptian music in the background. I can see the wild-and-crazy guy strutting his stuff in the 70's bar scene. So I got some good laughs. If the reader lacks the ability to roll these flavors together in this dish, I'd wait for the video. For Fans Only! Too little for too much."
5,at last a dog hero with a real job,"A dog in the story is no longer a ""gimmick"". Conant has presented a dog serving a real purpose, and the usefullness of this task is an integral part of the story. I have passed on copies of this book it is so relevant, and a darned good read, too"
1,quite possibly the worst book ever written,"This is the kind of book teachers try to force upon students, making them experience this horror. This is the very worst of anything possible, I would buy all the copies and burn them if I could, but too bad I'm not that ric, so I must plea to you: BURN YOUR COPY BEFORE ITS TOO LATE"
3,FAR FETCHED,NICHOLAS CAGE SHOULD HANG IT UP HE LOOKS SO BAD .THE MOVIE WAS JUST TOOOO SILLY .TO BE BELIEVED PERIOD
5,Wow! Really Beautiful!,This ring is beautiful. I returned it because it is too big/wide for my finger but the diamonds are an EXCELLENT quality. This ring is worth every penny.
1,It (...) muchos!,"I liked the first two and the last movie but this blows. I mean, the acting is (...) ad it goes against parts one and two in that now the movie becomes self-aware.My sister owns a leo dicraprio annual which declares mr. dicraprio's hate for this movie(hey we agree!)But then i thought, if i were in a (...) movie, i'd show everyone i was better than it by acting well!But he didn't. (...)Brodie(...)"
5,PERFECT!,"This book is a PERFECT intro for kids 8ish and older. Unfortunately, my son was taught many explicit swears relating to body parts at recess (that most people say they didn't know until they were in college). This book was just right for an introduction. It doesn't go into too much detail, has great little comics to inject a little laughter/diffuse the embarrassment. I found it at our library and decided it was well worth buying."
3,Good value for price.,I had a previous unit with more bells and whistles but costs twice as much to replace. This at half the price and does the job. Sturdy and works the same at the business end off the brush.
4,"Bike Computer - Functional, but clumsy","This was a great idea - once I had it all hooked up, I realized that wireless would have been easier.No problems putting it on bike; fiancee took care of that.Do find it challenging to change the settings as the buttons are tiny and hard to use. But, easy to reset the tripdometer. Pops off easily (but not too easily) for when I park it in a public place.Seems fairly accurate and keeps me motivated to go a bit further each time.Love knowing cumulative miles done on the bike."
5,Be Healthy!,Sometimes you just need to schedule the time to work on your health like you schedule other things in your life. What this DVD & live healthy. You are worth it!
5,Matches Moonbeam Crib Set,This was on our registry along w/the crib set. It matches great & looks wonderful in our nursery. It adds the perfect decorative touch that our daughters room needed!
3,Chilly!,"If anything, that book has taught me what I don't want to be when I grow up: an empty soul in search of an anchor of some sort. ""Independence Day"" served as a great kick in the butt, and I am thankful for that!"
5,healthy nutrition review,thouht it was well written and contain a lot of information about eating right that can be applied to ones life.
3,A Decent Read,"Well, I agree with the what the reviewer from Booklist said. This novel is good ""though somewhat contrived."" Living in Los Angeles I already hear too much about the lives of people in the entertainment field and broadcasting. Fictional stories that involve them are pretty superficial. So I was kind of disappointed about this aspect of the book, especially with the Hollywood ending. The other characters were more real and believable. Life in the South is clearly what she knows best. Fried Green Tomatoes, way better than this book. One thing I will say is that I did learn a few things about the 40s/50s that I just didn't know nor ever read about. I'll have to check on the meaning of the term ""passing."""
2,THAY NEED HELP FROM DESTINY'S CHILD - Tasha,"PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM UNLESS YOU LIKE THE SAME SONG ALL OVER AGAIN, AND AGAIN. PLEASE THAY ARE NOT BETTER THAN DESTINY'S CHILD, THAY CANNOT COMPARE. IAM SOORRY, BUT I ONLY LIKE THREE SONGS, IAM SO HAPPY THAT I DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM, SOMEBODY GAVE IT TO ME."
2,Dissapointing,"After the brilliant ""Go Now"", ""Godlike"" clocks in as one big dissapointment. Sure the writing has more 'craft' now, but the storytelling is scattered, and the flipping between multiple viewpoints and time frames succeeds only in making the pace drag, and the - rather simple - plot seem convulted and messy.Whereas ""go Now"" was full of life and great writing, Godlike is cold and rather boring. You dont paticularly care for what happens. You are very aware that Hell is trying to stretch out as a writer and conquor new ground, but the book is a pretty staid, academic exercise.I was really looking forward to this book, but I struggled to finish it once I got it."
1,Rehashed newspaper articles,"No new revelations here. This story has been told in earlier books, and with more ground breaking impact. This is a case of the publisher hoping to capitalize on a big business story, but too late !! See earlier books on the Microsoft antitrust case, such as The Microsoft File."
5,Latest in a series,"This book is the latest in Fred Saberhagen's Berserker series. I haven't had the time to read it yet, but I will eventually."
3,Rendered Obsolete By The Box Sets....,"Some excellent guitar from Iommi, but very thin production and don't even get me started on Ozzy (it's as if the demons he sang about on ""Sabatoge"" have begun to take over). But yes, Ozzy is here so you have to have it (isn't that kinda like UFO's ""Love To Love""?).(...) You need to hear the original albums remastered and you ain't gonna get it here; for that reason this release is pretty much obsolete. Actually would go up to 3 1/2 stars."
4,Simultaneous outputs,"Nice enough player.The user interface is plain - nothing more than text, without the polish of Sony combo units.Ignore the editorial review's comments on needing a receiver with analog inputs. This player does provide analog outputs for surround, but it also provides optical output for connection to a receiver that decodes its own surround sound.The machine has one standout capability: when playing a DVD on progressive scan, the VCR/DVD line outputs are still active and correct! (Many current players will disable the line outputs when set to progressive scan [e.g. Samsung] or they will scramble and become unusable [e.g. Sony].) This is a splendid feature if you are driving an HDTV monitor and a ""normal"" TV (i.e. one in another room) simultaneously. (Admittedly, if you don't use this arrangement, this feature has little value; but for those who do drive dual monitors, this is a critical feature that is rarely found.)"
4,The Lightwedge Lighted Pocket Magnifier meets our needs.,We recommend the Magnifier. We are able to read small print and see tiny images printed in ads. The light has been used as a backup flashlight. We gave it four stars because there is no case to protect it.
5,A true classic.....especially for Pink Floyd fans,You thought this film is great on its own....try watching it with the volume turned all the way down while listening to Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon. Pause it just before the first song and after you hear the third lion roar in the very beginning (before the movie begins) unpause the cd. You will be amazed!
1,don't be fooled......,".... contains little of value. you believe that by purchasing this item that you will have access to the MUSTER ROLLS .... indeed, that is what appears on the cover of the CD. in fact this is a $40 index! there is no information to this effect anywhere, and to make matters worse there is no ""consolation prize"" for having wasted your money (i.e., you can actually see the muster rolls if you go to washington, petition the national archives, or whatever). borderline misrepresentation."
1,Disappointed,"I had ordered a used ""in good condition"" leather bound edition of the Presbyterian Hymnal at a cost of $31.90 from Your On Line Bookstore. I received, (very promptly), a standard hard cover hymnal which retails new for about $14.00. I emailed the company asking that they send the product I ordered. They replied that they did not have the leather bound edition and that I should send the hardcover version back to them - ""return receit requested"" postage. The cost of the postage was about $8.00. So I'm out $8 and without the hymnal I wanted. Certainly not the end of the world - but to descirbe my experience - I would say, ""Disappointed""."
3,"This is a fun book for Fourth,Fifth and Sixth graders","I have just used this book for the first time this week and the upper graders and teachers loved it. I am a storyreader who travels to many schools reading my favorite books. Barbara Parks is one of my favorite authors be cause of her use of language that kids can relate to, and they can surely relate to the humor in Bogeyman! Jim McKenna, STORYREADER"
3,"Easy to read, yet lets you down by the end","I picked this book up at the airport and was halfway finished with it by the time my plane landed. It was very easy to read but I have to say this author managed to forget one major component to what makes a good novel- creating memorable characters. Not only were these characters not memorable that weren't even really that likable. I never understood what made them tick or even more importantly why they were even friends. With all of that said, I did enjoy the hardships and problems the characters had to deal with and overcome throughout the novel. So basically story line- 5 Characters- 1 and you end up with 3 stars."
2,Not impressed at all,"The book is not completely bad, but I wish it had more complete and accurate information -- there's much better material on the marketplace."
5,"An Exquisite, and Profoundly told, Story","The Golden Compass, and its 2 sequels (The Subtle Knife, and The Amber Spyglass) is a story featuring profound concepts, displaying the most original creativity in characters & and in plot, and a ""can't put it down"" story line, that can be understood and appreciated by people of all ages. I am reading all three for the 2nd time, and I have enjoyed it more even than the first read through. I am a youthful 72 year old, and I would recommend this Trilogy to anyone I am related to, regardless of age. I also these books would inspire new writers."
1,Equivalent,"I received the product today only to find that it was not what was ordered. I ordered a K&N; Air filter and received an product I am unfamiliar with called DNA Air filter from a company in Greece.I contacted the seller and they were very cooperative in resolving the order. As it turned out, the DNA product was of same or better value so I decided to keep the filter"
5,Work for my Sunbeam Microwave Oven,I need this bit set to open my microwave oven so that I can change the fuse. The best fit one is T-20.For people with negative review about the quality of this product: I (and neither do many other people) do NOT have a chance to try the high-end bit set. Nor do we use it everyday. This is simply the best option available if you don't know the exact size of torx. It's the cheapest and fastest delivery.
1,Do not buy!,"This pool's rim is so stretched out it will not contain more than a few inches of water. I drilled a hole near the edge and bolted it together to create less stretch, but it still will not contain more than 6 inches. Id had one like this before that worked very well but this one was a big disappointment. Don't buy."
1,don't waste your time,"A big, big waste of time. There are far better courses, software, books, teachers than this. Not saying itsa total waste of time, as there are some valid comments made in all of BW's books, particularily relatingto the mental and pyschological aspects of trading. I bought 2 home study courses, attended 2 private tutorialsand read all three books multiple times. Trust me, I wanted this to work so badly BUT, in a nutshell, the'system' and set of techniques are unreliable and fluffy. After 10 years of trying to make sense and make profitI gave up. Don't believe the hype. The moment I threw all of this material in the trash, was the moment I startedon the road to success. Not blaming anybody, I take full responsibility. You really can do better than this."
4,Dictionary of Strum and Picking Patterns,"covers a wonderfully wide range of styles of music. Wish each demo track could be longer but, I realize, that then there couldn't be as many tracks on the CD as there are so it is a trade off. I found I needed to slow the tracks down in a music editing program to get some of them, as some were too fast to grasp initially... for an intermediate like myself. I also used the music program to loop the tracks to hear it more times in a row. I like it over all."
5,dickens on england,"This book is a delightful history of England. It is a book for all ages. As an adult I have enjoyed reading the book for pure pleasure. My two teenage daughters have used this book numerous times for school projects, especially for their history and compostion classes."
4,Why is this movie like U-571?,"There was a lot of flak about _U-571_ because that movie fictionalizes the seizure of an ENIGMA machine from a U-boat... combining two real events involving BRITISH sailors and ships (the capture of the U-505 being almost irrelevant to the ENIGMA story).No (previous) reviewer had mentioned that _The Enemy Below_ is based on a novel of the same name ... involving a BRITISH destroyer hunting a U-boat. The movie tracks very well with that novel, other than some cultural changes for the US crew of the US ship. Therefore I think that Leonard Maltin may have it wrong when he says this is essentially a remake of a 1930's movie. I believe it really is an Americanization of the (early 1950s) British novel.Yes, the (original) _Star Trek_ episode ""Balance of Terror"" is based on this movie. Both are gripping and suspenseful, and have memorable moments."
4,A good album.,"Golden Earring ""To The Hilt"" #156 (1976).Golden Earring was coming off two excellent albums, ""Moontan"" and ""Switch"". 1976 gave us ""To The Hilt"". This album just doesn't add up to those last two albums. There are some good tunes in the funky long number ""Why Me?"", the title track is a good boogie song and ""Sleepwalkin'"", the bass drives this song, one of GE's at their funkiest. There is no ""Radar Love"" or ""Candy's Going Bad"", but if your a Golden Earring fan get the album."
1,Worst 'Biker' Flick EVER! ! ! !,"I caught this POS on Dish the other night, and don't know which was the stronger urge, trying to stay awake, or not changing the channel. I have lived the Life for over 40 years, and, to an 'Old School' Outlaw, this is the lowest form of satirical comedy bordering on insult. I can't believe it was actually written & produced by anyone who had ever had anything to do with this 'genre', even the 'B' class U/A flicks from the '60's'. It views like some high school kid's fantasy wet dream.If you MUST watch this piece of drivel, do like I did and catch it on Dish or cable (IF you can sit thru it!) and save your bucks for gas money. . . . .The actors, especially Hopper & Carradine, must either have been bored out of their minds or had some serious debts to pay off to get involved in this stinkeroo!"
3,De'Longhi EC155 - Not built to last,"I like this espresso maker. I make four double shots every day. I used it for just over a year when it first failed. It was leaking water all over my counter. I'm experienced at small appliance repair so I took it apart. I do NOT recommend repairing it yourself unless you have the required experience. One of the two o-rings in the water pump circuit needed to be replaced. I replaced the o-ring (about $2.50) and got another year of use. Then, it failed again with another leak and also stopped heating. This time I replaced the other o-ring and a thermostat. Repair parts cost me about $20. It's working nicely again and continues to give me decent espresso. I got it for half price as a closeout from a big box store, so it's still a good value to me. However, I'm not impressed with the build quality."
3,Good book,A decent book. I was interested in the subject and the title caught my eye. The book arrived in time and in condition promised.
5,And now she is gone.,"It's been a very, very long time since I heard a singer who could give me goosebumps. I hope someone issues an anthology of all her songs so I don't have to buy each CD."
4,Its a good read... too bad about all the bigoted reviewers,"Not Barkers best....but Please people, hating a book because the main character happens to be gay...is so absurd..which by the way you find out in like the first three pages..If that offends you... flip through a book before you waste time reading it.. and then... keep your prejudice to yourself. Reveiwed by a heterosexual."
4,"Ah, The 80's!!","Ullman delivers with this collection of her best known hits of the '80's, pre-comedy. Many of the numbers are reminiscent of '50's and '60's girl groups in the U.S., and there are also plenty of original songs (If you're looking for the theme to HBO's 'Tracy Takes On', it's on this CD). If you liked the sound of the Go-Go's and Bangles, here's another CD you will probably enjoy. Most of the tunes are rockin' upbeat tunes that are fun to hum along with ( or sing, if you're alone :-) ), but that is just my personal preferance. With 16 tracks, you can aford to skip over the few clinkers--whatever your preference."
4,A Page Turner!,"This is a great series to get hooked on. For a week or so, I think my fellow passengers on the train thought I was insane- I was laughing, squealing, and wincing just from this book. Please check it out and enjoy!"
2,nice package but poor performance,"My daugher received this machine for her 6th birthday. She was so excited to use it but we found that unless she was holding the mic directly on her mouth, you could not hear her sing at all. The volume was all the way up and still it was extremely low. The machine itself is very attractive with the lyrics displayed nicely on the screen but if you can't hear the person singing..what's the point."
2,Misleadingly titled,"The book's subtitle is ""A Czech History,"" but people looking for a general history of the Czech lands will be disappointed. Sayer focuses not on battlefields and parliaments but on art, literature and historiography. He either completely ignores or barely mentions such topics as the world wars, the Munich Pact and the Communist coup while devoting dozens of pages to poets, artists and critics. Thus, despite the rather esoteric nature of Czech history, Sayer assumes readers already know the basics. I guess a title like ""The Humanities and Czech Identity, 1620-1960"" wouldn't sell as well."
3,This one is pretty different.,"What bothered me about this book wasn't the eroticism (in truth, I found the sex scenes deliciously different for a romance tale), but the complete departure from what I know a Small novel to be. This book wasn't as descriptive, nor did it explore the characters' personalities as much as previous works. Bertrice Small usually goes on and on and on and ON about locations, character details, even matters as simple as royalty parties and fetes. With this novel she seems to just say, ""Here's Belle. Here's Hugh. They're married. Uhoh, something happened, let's go find her. (Insert bed scene here.) All over. The end."" A little more depth would have been nice. But the erotic scenes were actually not badly crafted. If the story had the depth of The Kadin or Skye O'Malley I think I would have enjoyed this a LOT more."
4,Game Boy Advance SP Pro Gamer's Case,"product arrived rather fast (always a good thing) & was in very fair condition for being used. it has alot of space for it's size & the aluminum construction was one of the best ideas anyone has had for these things , they are extremely durable because of the metal & can take a bit of a beating. this is a great purchase & i hope to get a second one in the near future for additional storage space (if you store GBC games in it they use up space fast due to size). 4 stars ONLY because its used but if it had been new it would get atleast a 6-9."
4,Great color and fabric - noticed imperfections in shades after washing!,"This is such a great color and I loved the napkins upon arrival - I bought 4 packages (16 napkins in all)-- Then I washed them in cold water and I noticed the shading of the dye seemed to vary within each individual napkin - this is only noticeable upon close inspection! They are made of a very durable canvas type material but be prepared to iron them if used for formal dining!Even though they are 100% cotton, the shrinkage was minimal compared to how the matching placemats shrank (I gave them 3 stars).Noticed problems with lint sticking to them too.Still recommend as the fabric itself will last for years and is great for casual dining!"
2,"Good movie, bad dvd",this is just a re-release of the original bare bones dvd. no bonus content at all.
5,Very Cute!!,"Like ""Peek-A-Moo"" which we also own for our daughter, this book is very cute! The flaps are nice and big and very easy for tiny hands to open. The colors are bright and bold and my husband and I have so much fun with this book with our 10 month old who loves flap books."
5,Great Recipes..... easy to make.... In your own language,The book contains classic recipes from the french cuisine that for us amateurs turns into great dishes.The language he uses is extremely easy and specially cause he remembers taht none of us is aware of measuring ingredients into the correct ounces or grams etc..
5,the drink masters good book,love love love itbeautiful pictures and allpeople borrow it all the timegreat buyi use it as much a possibleand i have order more and gave out as gifts
4,"Good Read, Good Characters, nicely written","The Secret Life of Bees is a Good Read with highly developed chacters and is nicely written. There are slow moments in the middle of the book, but stick with it, it all comes together smoothly. Marjorie Spoto - Author, When It Rains."
1,Yuck!,"Who makes pot roast with worchestshire and A-1? I did because the recipe instructed me to do so and I was sorely disappointed. This is not the first time I've regretted following a recipe from this book, but it will definitely be my last. Yuck!"
4,Works fine,"Works as intended. The only drawback is that the cord is a bit short, so you cannot power the phone while using it as a gps on the windshield."
1,Aboslutely ridiculous.,"I don't know if the ""theory"" works or not, because the watch is total garbage. I have other complaints, but I'll just list the biggest. The $5 watch that costs $100 comes with a very soft beep for an alarm. You cannot make it louder in any way. So, the watch may or may not wake you up assuming it's right next to you, but once you put your wrist under a blanket, it's completely inaudible. In the summer, if you sleep without a blanket, it might wake you up. However, if you care at all when you wake up, set a real alarm also, because this one will probably not wake you up at all. I fully support their right to charge $100 for a $5 watch that includes some new inventive ""technology,"" but it would be nice if they made it to actually work. I have no other description of the implementation of this idea other than: ridiculous. I'm sure they'll fix this problem at some point, and I think they now have a $200 version that vibrates. Do not buy this watch until they fix this problem."
2,Yawn.,"Other readers have commented on blatant translation errors or chronological discrepancies. Given my limited knowledge of the subject matter, I cannot offer any insight here. Most salint for me, though, are the shortcomings in Thomas' writing style. I found it utterly unengaging in its blandness. The disjointed chronology and Thomas' lack of credible support for his yarns also did him no favors. Surely there are better works on the subject."
4,Beautiful!,"We used this book for an art history course at Yale University, on art, architecture, and design from 1890 to 1940. The book is great! Usually I find the survey sort of book - covering something so wide and expansive as MODERNISM - to get bogged down in cliches or neat little epigrams for quick consumption, but there's no cursory cute treatment here. Weston covers a lot - he's great on explaining theories and movements of design etc but also gives appropriate history, politics, and culture. And that's good, because I like to know what Ezra Pound is thinking about modernism, as it happens. It takes you through time and space nicely - painting, architecture, advertisement, furniture, etc - and you don't feel as if you missed out on anything. Plus the illustrations/photographs are beautiful - I spent so much time just in love with the book for that. Not only is it helpful, but the writing is clear and intelligent, sometimes funny, and irreverent if necesssary."
3,Broken ear loop,"I have not yet purchased the Plantronics headset. It looks very much like the Nokia and I had the same problem with the earloop breaking where the ring snaps onto the headset. Super glue does not work (and doesn''t on many plastics) but there is a simple solution. Purchase a bag of heatshrink tubing at Radio Shack. Pick a size that just slips over the broken ring, work it back over the other side and heat (I used a propane lighter, carefully!). The repair has held up for over a year."
5,BIB FROGG TOGS,"THESE ARE THE SECOND PAIR OF FROGG TOGS I HAVE OWNED JUST WORE THE OTHER PAIR OUT. THESE ARE THE BEST WARM, WATER PROOF ITEMS I HAVE EVER OWNED. HAVE TALKED FRIENDS INTO PURCHASEING THESE FOR SKING. I PURCHASED A PAIR FOR MYSELF AND MY HUSBAND FOR A FISHING TRIP TO ALASKA. IT RAINED ALL DAY THE FIRST DAY OF FISHING AND WE STAYED HIGH, DRY AND WARM. YOU CAN NOT GO WRONG WITH ANY FROGG TOG ITEM"
3,Okay,"Got it for my son. He used to take it when he was younger and it seemed to help somewhat. Not a cure, but it did seem to help decrease to amount of migraines. Not sure it is helping as much now. Doesn't t help me at all."
2,Be warned,Hopefully this is going to give you some really helpful tips about this series.When this series first aired they showed the second to the last episode first. A lot of people complained about this and apparently after reading another review they followed the same pattern with the DVD release.The fansub group that was doing this series originaly added pictures of the characters in this series and it sparked a huge debate. The banner was changed eventualy. The viewers complained about the series being on about the same level as Hentai.On a frequent basis the main characters close will suddenly explode leaving her completely bare. I won't give you any details as to why if you do decide to watch this series.This series in the end landed in my pile of never to watch again.I will admit though the ending song is probably one of the best songs I have heard on any anime series. It's one that I want for my primary music collection.
2,Not Worth the Money,I went to the movies to see the Planet of Apes just to see what the hype was all about. Well after sitting their and enduring the whole movie I was totally disgusted with the ending. How in the world did he go back to the past only to find the apes had taken over? And when he kissed the ape chick that was totally nasty....ewwww Mark Whalberg!!!!If you like Sci-fi then you might consider this movie...if you don't then SAVE THE MONEY!!!
1,Should be Zero stars,"I regret buying this book. I was fooled by the reviews. It is absolute crap. Plot is predictable, story and characters are unrealistic, a complete waste of time. It is not material for a serious reader of fiction."
2,Wrangler Jeans,"I received my jeans in reasonable time and the label on the jeans indicated they were a 28 inch inseam. However, when I wore them, they were dragging on the floor. I then measured them with a tailor's tape and the jeans inseam measured 30 inches. My wife will now have to correctly size them."
5,Mr.Tucket,"Mr.Tucket, by Gary Paulsen, is by far his greatest book yet. It is about Francis Tucket who is in a wagon train bound for Oregon. He falls behind the train to practice shooting his new gun, and is captured by a groupe of indians. With the help of Jason Grimes (a one armed mountian man), he escapes the savages and learns the way of the mountians. There are two more sequels to this book, and I hope G.Paulsen will write another."
5,Millie-Millie,"I really enjoy this album. It's the first album Millie has made that combinds rock, pop,and country all in one package. Although, this album was a push in a different dirrection for her and was I'd say somewhat of a risk, in the end it all paid off. Her voice is still as strong and beautiful as it always was. Whenever I listen to this album, it makes me feel like getting up to sing and dance along. It's not offten that you listen to an album and every time it puts a smile on your face. Great Work, Millie!"
1,the Poor Lil Kim,Trina I Love to watch but hearing on the Mic is a No-No.hopefully She will get a Show like Anne Nicole Smith? I enjoy Anne as far as watching but I keep Her on Mute.the same way with Trina.I Like watching Her but Hearing Her is something Bad.She can't Rap or Sing the Music is lackluster to me overall.at best She is a Lil Kim Clone.at worst hurting on the ears.
4,Elegant but egg sticks to its threads,"I like:Its elegant look and stainless steel body. Its very handy and robust.A very good product for the money I spent. Its worth more than that.I dislike:After slicing the egg, it sticks to its thread and makes it very difficult to clean.Overall: A nice product to buy if you clean it immediately after slicing."
4,Pleasently surprised,"I have only made one recipe (chickpea rague), but it was very good and went over well with my meat-and-potatos man. I found the book easy to read (I did not find the font color challenging), and it's quite simple to make subtle ingrediate substitutions. I've used a few of the other recipes as ""inspirations"" behind other dishes I hadn't ever cosidered before. I would recommend it as I'm not exactly a novice in the the kitchen but definitely need lots of help, especially with meal planning. It just forces me to think outside the ""pasta, stir-fry, or chicken"" rut after work."
1,Did a 14 year old make this story up!?!?!,"The story was boring and poorly written. Xenia seeberg is an ok actress with a nice body. She couldn't do anything to make it worth watching. I gave It a star because I liked the music video ""Here comes the pain"". If you are a hard core Christian don't watch it. It has Chist on a cross cursing. It has a music video with a remake of a Depeche mode song ""never let me down again"". I never thought I would see Xenia seeberg singing never let me down again in a wild west saloon wearing 1800's atire. The man singing with her has a very annoying voice. Like nails to the ears. It was nice to hear xenia sing a song that I like."
4,essential ani,"the acoustics on this album kick...no sellout here ladies and gents! she's the real deal, playing her heart out into music that reeks with humanity."
5,Mario Kart Wii has come out. Can how does this game compare?,"If you read the title question the answer is amazing! Although the Wii version has the steering wheel and motorbikes, if you dont mind having only 16 courses (4 unlockable) and using the Gamecube controller then your set! works great on Wii and having 2 riders makes it even more fun. Not to mention Co-op racing. You can have 2 players on the same Kart switching between thrower and driver at will in the middle of a race. Another thing this has that the Wii doesnt is special items. You make your karts 2 riders a good team by their special items (yosh= big egg, mario= fireballs). I perfer Gamecube myself.Then you've got the bonus disk. 1st off its not about Mario Kart. its got demos for games like Star Wars ouge Squadron III: Rebel Strike and Mario Party 5 and videos from other games. The bonus disk is nice, but i wouldnt pay more for it alone.In the end, you'll be satisflyed if you buy this."
5,Winner this Christmas!!!,"This is a very durable toy my 12-yest-old sone adores! It is large and does so many things and ""Looks cool"". My son will spend hours playing with it in an imaginary world. A little on the heavy side for smaller kids, but very well made and thought through. I highly suggest this purchase for the masculine boy :)"
2,Something easier,"I have a laptop and a desktop and needed one place to enter my household expenses. I now use my bank of america site along with moneypants.com I also like reading the articles and encouragement i get from the newsletter. i like budgeting over the web better than using ""my budget planner."""
4,great book,"for a just-above-elementary learner like me, getting started learning Hanzi, this is a wonderful book! five more words needed for review"
5,We loved it,My wife and I are in our 30's and we are well educated and and love movie's with a good story. This film was smart and funny and it had good pacing. They need to make more westerns because there are not enough. The acting was great and wow what mean villian. We bought this film right after we rented it. We really enjoyed this and you should too.
2,"heavy, cheap materials, did dry hair fast","This hair drier worked wonderfully for the first few weeks. Then it started falling apart. The cord began working loose from the plug and the non-standard screws made that impossible to fix (not that you're legally allowed to do that). It is a heavy unit and its long cord was even heavier so it would drag itself off the counter with stunning regularity, threatening safety of toes and eventually breaking the rear filter cap. Within a few months it also developed an incessant and annoying whine (perhaps also from the falls). It does dry hair fast and shiny, if you can keep it from suicide jumping from the counter. Too expensive for shoddy workmanship."
2,enough with the politics,"I have to agree with the reviewer from January 1st, Hoplite Whatever-his-name-is on one thing. Pearl Jam needs to get rid of the Bush-bashing. I say this not in any great defense of our current president; I am neither pro- nor anti-Bush. I am a registered independent, and so have no interest in feeding the two-headed monster that has a stranglehold on our political system. However, I am tired of hearing PJ bitch and moan about everything Bush does. I'll bet they would even criticize the way the man takes a piss. They should do what every other empty-headed, plastic personality celebrity should do in regards to political statements: leave it alone."
2,This was tedious,"No, I don't buy into the ""Oprah chose it, so it must be good"" thought. Neither do I think the Pulitzer prize means much these days. The truth is that this book did not impact me like it apparently did others. The dialogue is so overtly simple that it's painful and the descriptions are so repetitive.(Question: How many times do they say OK? Answer: As many times as he talks about the ash.)His style is so easy to copy that one wonders, ""what, then, is the big deal?"" This is like modern art (You know, those splatterings of paint on a canvas that people call ""art"" and they read into it any artistic interpretation that comes to mind, when in reality it really is just blots on canvas). This book is like that, to me. If you want to overanalyze it and call it ""profound"", that's fine, but the reality is that this is a poorly told story with little or not literary value.I've read ""The Border Trilogy"" and wasn't too thrilled with those books either. I guess I'm done with McCarthy. BLEH"
3,Rather disappointing,"I've read through the first two books and I have to say, it was a rather boring experience. I was recommended these by some online friends who said they were brilliant. The first book was rather drawn out; the main plot is based around the character's memories as he walks through a desert. It makes you feel like you've missed something the whole time. It made me feel like there should have been a book before the first and was a bit angry that he spent most the time focusing on the past than what was currently happening. Half of the second book revolves around the main character and one of the people he has 'drawn' into his world. It again was a dragged out narrative that seemed to go nowhere.I dig King's descriptions of the events, but I would have liked to see the plot move faster. I haven't read all four books in the set, but I imagine much won't change."
3,Sony SRF-HM22 AM/FM Headphone Radio Walkman,Works great but I bought it with the plastic stability strap missing which is necessary for stability of the headphones.It falls forward every time I bend over but the price was right for a used item.
2,"convenient, but short life","I like this humidifier because it is small and compact with a clean exterior design. Last winter I bought my second one. Unfortunately it is going the same direction as the first. Initially it has nearly silent operation, which is extremely important to me. Over time it starts to gurgle more and more. I think there's a design issue of the internal components. Also, after a year of use, the heating element's material seems to be flaking off.In short: Good, but only if you consider it to be a short term item-one season only."
3,Useful - with limits,"Mr. Schweikart has written a useful text for students of American business or American history, but it is dated. Closing out pre-9/11, the stage Schweikart sets is not the one we must now act on. If a new edition were to be published, some of his conclusions and theories would need to be revised or at least expanded to address current issues in business and world affairs. It would also be nice to see a co-author to provide counterpoint to Schweikart's biases - my observance of which which is not intended to be anything more than an aknowledgement of human nature. Overall, a refreshing look at the development of the greatest economy on the planet. I only wish it had been written in 2003."
4,prosiac,"Massive book of prose. Afraid I will never finish this one. I expected poetry not an encyclopedia. Arrived in perfect condition and very quickly, I just didn't like the content. and did not finish."
3,a little too much,These are long!!!! They get kinda boring and i think they just put in the info to fill the book.
5,Keeps you young,"I have worked out to this video since 1985. I have most often used the first 30 minutes of stretching and aerobic dance when I can't get outdoors to jog or bike. The rest of the tape is still amazing, obviously more challenging for me now, but it was good in my 30s and still feels worthwhile in my 50s. It is definitely my favorite workout video ever."
4,30 minutes long and still a great work out,"Flats, intervals and hills: each 30 minutes long, just great if you don't have enough time and still feel you got a great work out. This is like a spin class but focused one of three aspects in a class. Nonetheless, you still get a decent work out and you can link two or all three of the work outs together! Great for beginners. The music is in the background, not instrusive and she does like to talk - not annoying."
4,Does what its supposed to do....,I got this for my 06 Tundra and its brought me some peace of mind since the fuel door doesn't lock. Cap is easy to use and has a quality feel. Be sure to turn it backwards after you tighten it to make sure it spins freely... sometimes it will not fully lock an you can just twist it off. Some have reported a check engine light with this and it goes away after putting the stock cap back on so don't throw it away just in case. I have not had this problem yet after about a month. Would buy again!
5,Scofield Mine Disaster Book,"I have read and owned this book. It was published in 1900 as a fund raiser for the deceased miners. The original bound version is getting scarce and includes photos. The book was reprinted by the Utah Railroad and Mining Museum of Helper, Utah as a part of the Centennial Celebration in 2000. The museum is a good source of information with many stories and video clips. However the Museum is volunteer funded and operated and it is not very efficient. I have made a xerox copy of this book. The one I used and read was stolen out of the Provo City Public Library sometime between 1984 and 1992. Other copies can be located at the Utah Historical Society in Salt Lake City."
5,Great Poster!!!,The quality of the poster is even better than we hoped! We are putting this poster ( and others) in our sons nursery that has a Star Wars theme to it. This poster is a perfect addition:)
4,junk batteries or not!,I puchased two of these OEM batteries for a 1.75 each plus 1.99 shipping and right from the start one battery would not hold a charge at all and within a week the other battery would not hold a charge as good as my four year old batteries that I was replacing! I sent a message to the seller with no response so the next best thing to do was to let people know about what happened when I bought the cheap batteries and got cheap batteries so shop arround and you can find good batteries at a little higher price!NOTE! After posting the review above the seller responded and replaced the defective batteries and the replacement batteries work Great! so far so good !
3,Boat protectors,"These were a little difficult to fit but they do the job. Before you buy, take into account the size of your boat cover if it extends down to the fenders like ours. Cover doesnt fit in the front now."
1,Why would you pay this much!?,"This game seems like an awesome game and I am very interested to play it but there's no way I'm paying what is now the used price of 70-something dollars for it, let alone the MINIMUM new price of 140$. It's just not going to happen. I understand that the authors of the game must have done a ton of work to get this game to work out just right and I have no doubt they spent a lot of time on it but this is just way more expensive than it needs to be. There's no way it could cost more than any other book costs to publish."
1,Skechers Suck!,My Skechers were very poorly built. I had to return them after wearing 6 times. I now have to wait 4-6 weeks to have them replaced and they won't give me my money back to get different shoes.
3,PamOne m500 handheld,This is a replacement for the Palm Zire for me. I liked the visibility of the Zire better. This is easy to use.
4,Can't self-replace battery,"Pros: It shows date, time, and day of week on one screen. Band is flexible and easy to put on your wrist. The CR2016 lithium battery is said to last 7 years. Very low cost for a good watch.Cons: Awkward to set time etc initially because the two setting buttons are tiny and recessed. Can do only with the edge of your fingernail. Battery cannot be self-replaced (back requires watchmaker's tool to remove, no screws). Watchmaker charges $12 to replace battery, which is what the watch costs. Better to replace watch than replace battery. You may wish to consider buying several watches at once to have as spares rather than bother with replacing battery by watchmaker. Keep spares in refrigerator to prolong battery life."
2,Super gentle,"I could see why people with sensitive skin would find this product beneficial. It is gentle and doesn't dry your skin out. If didn't love to wear makeup so much, I would probably rate this product higher. But as far as cleaning products off your skin, this cleanser is horrible. I have to use 2 or 3 other products to actually help me clean my skin thoroughly. It does nothing to control breakouts either. Not for people with normal/oily congested skin."
1,Description is not accurate,"I can't attest to the quality because I didn't use them. The reason I bought them is because they said they were Made in Portugal. I was looking for something not made in China. Well, lo and behold, it gets here and there is a sticker on it that says ""Made in China."""
4,If you like Latin ladies...,"The video is worth five stars, for the beautiful Latin ladies of Rio, alone. The reason I deducted one star is due to the fact that the ""Rio"" part of the video is less than an hour long. The remainder is a sort of an ""adult"" music video, that you may or may not enjoy. When the ""Party in Rio"" is over, send the kids out of the room."
2,Not enough TMNT,"This is the second volume of the new TMNT series. A lot of plot points are introduced in these three episodes, including the Turtles' first encounter with vigilante Casey Jones, their discovery of some interesting secrets concerning their new lair, the construction of their Battle Shell assault vehicle, and the introduction of the mystical Sword of Tengu. The Turtles also encounter a microscopic robot known as the Nano, which leads to an above-average filler adventure. If you're a Turtles' fan, these episodes are essential viewing.However, see if you can either rent this DVD or catch the re-runs on TV. 3 episodes a disc is a blatant rip-off. WB puts at least 4 episodes on its Batman/Justice League DVDs. Those are bad enough, but 3 is inexcusable. As much as I love the Turtles, I'm not wasting my money on these DVDs.TMNT is a quality cartoon series. This DVD is not."
5,Stone,Excellent book. I watched the movies before I read the books and it was nice to be able to put faces with the characters in this case (since I enjoy Tom Selleck as an actor).
3,OK,Just a time filler when I work out. Don't reall like any of the characters. Often stupid reather than funny.
3,No Suds!,I really like this shower gel. It smells really good and leaves my skin clean and smooth. The only thing I don't like about this product is that there are not a lot of bubbles and it doesn't foam up enough.
5,First Purchase Praise,Very satisfying to finally have this CD after 50 years. My girlfriend sang it at my wedding as it was a favorite. Amazon made it possible and have my deepest thanks.
2,What are you thinking?,"I was thinking ""looks great!"" I want a heater that has oil filled. ""It has a timer great!"" But the timer is not the ""I want it on for 2 hours then turn it off kind"" it's the ""I want it on between this hour and that hour every day"" kind. A foot peddle On/Off. Wonderfull I don't have to bend down. Did you notice the thing has wheels? Easy to transport, moves even whial you are trying to turn it on. I say trying because I have to step on it 3 or 4 times to get it to, turn on, change modes, to turn off. This is the second we send the first one back because the foot peddle on/off didn't work at all. I might buy another heater from Deonghi, but not this model. What are you thincking?"
2,Not a good place to start in the series...,"Probably I'll pick up another of Ann Ripley's books because I like gardening and because she lives just up the road here in Colorado. But truthfully, I was not able to make it past the first 60 pages of this book. The characters seemed wooden, the premise of the plot seemed completely implausible, and the writing itself had me sighing for better editing. Why all of two stars? Because I could see the possibilities, at least, even if they seemed woefully unrealized. There's much more and better to read, and I'm going to move along now."
5,Brilliant,"This book was the funniest book of the year. True it did point out some serious issues, and at the same time revealed the humor in them. Kim, you go girl!"
5,Must have item for Fitness Instructor,"I bought this book is because it is in my suggested reading list of the Pilates Instructor course. Though I haven't finished reading this book, I know that I'll carry it together with me for exercise practice, for both self practice and teaching practice. It is helpful when I want to understand the emphasis of a particular exercise."
1,Worthless,"I saw how to get past the hurdle of having the wrong adapter as the default so that was easy. Everything else was horrible. Attaching it to the plug is hard and so much air leaks that it took about 1/2 hour to pump a tire to nearly full. Detaching it was a pain and since the parts are plastic, I can't see it taking the abuse it takes just to remove it for too many times. By the time the second tire was half full, my patience was gone. RETURNED. I'd rather have a standard full-sized pump that this frustrating gadget."
3,Average book but you need HANDS ON,The book is good but you half to have allot of hands on for this test. Do notuse this as your only study source
4,One of the best phones I have had!,I found this phone to have one of the coolest camera features ever the outside large screen to let u see yourself when taking your own picture unlike the tiny mirror on most phones! It takes good quality pictures and has outstanding sound quality. I also found it easyest to navagate. The only bad side i found is its bulky and has no zoom on camera!
3,DECEPTIVE PHOTO BUT KNIVES ARE OK,"READ THE DESCRIPTION CAREFULLY, THIS IS FOR THE KNIVES ONLY NO PAINT PALETTES INCLUDED. THESE WERE BOUGHT TO REPLACE A MUCH CHEAPER SET OF KNIVES THAT WERE EVERY BIT AS GOOD QUALITY BUT WE PAID THE EXTRA BECAUSE OF THE PLAETTES INCLUSION ILLUSION. WE WILL KEEP BUT ARE NOT THRILLED WITH THE DECEPTIVE PHOTO USED TO DISPLAY THE ITEM, WE ADMIT THAT WE SHOULD HAVE READ THE WHOLE PAGE MORE CAREFULLY BUT SINCE WE DIDNT HAVE A REVIEW TO GO FROM THOUGHT WE WERE GETTING AS PICTURED ITEMS. WE WONT MAKE THE MISTAKE AGAIN, ADVISE TO GET THE CHEAPER KNIVES THEY ARE OF GOOD QUALITY AND MUCH MORE REASONAL IN PRICING. OVER 20 DOLLARS DIFFERENCE"
2,Song from the End of the Movie,The song from the end of the movie is called Only You and was by the band Yaz.
1,Beware False DVD Packaging,"While this is probably not a bone of contention with most viewers, I think it's worth noting for those that do pay attention to these things, especially if you base your purchases on them, as I did in this case. The packaging on this newer DVD edition of ""Cabaret"" states that it is an anamorphic transfer (i.e. ""Enhanced for Widescreen TVs""). It is NOT. This is the SAME disc as before, with new a label on it.They merely changed the packaging, I guess, so that they could mention ""Chicago"" in the description on the back cover and tie it into the heat for that film. Shame on you, Warner Bros. We all work hard for our money and deserve better than to believe we're buying a new anamorphic transfer, when you are really marketing the exact same discs as before."
2,You get what you pay for. Don't expect it to last long.,"This was great for about 3 weeks.Our dog is ~85 lbs. and needs help getting up the stairs.While this product worked, it worked well. But it tore after 3 weeks. Thankfully we noticed before using it."
5,Lots of useful info,"I bought this book used and recommend it highly for those with a Maxxum 7d. It will help to uncover a lot of the very advanced features of the 7d, which I consider a camera way ahead of its time."
2,Unhappy,I used this mixer for about a year and a half and it never could handle making a two cup bread recipe. Shuts off and now I think the gears have gone out on it. I love this mixer but I am kind of dis-appointed.
5,Loved it!!!,I bought this book because it was one of the few I hadn't read of Koontz yet. I didn't know what to expect because the Frankenstein idea has become almost a cliche. I was pleasantly surprised. I couldn't put the book down. I immediatelly went out and bought book 2. Now I'm waiting for the third to be written. I strongly recommend this book for any Koontz fan.
4,What was expected,Great version. Exactly what it said it was going to be & what I expected. Very pleased!
5,5 pounds in three weeks,"This game (if you can call it that) provides the most intense, well-rounded workout you could you could ever dream of performing in your living room. I'm currently on week four of the six week challenge and have lost 5 pounds. If you want something that will kickstart you into good shape, this is the game for you. There are different levels of intensity to choose from so you can start at any level. There are a multitude of half hour workouts that target certain areas and you can alternate them daily. It also has a fitness journal that is very easy to use and helpful for your progress. This is the most important video game I've ever purchased.Gameplay is good, I've run into a few technical errors that are inconvenient, but nothing too bad."
3,The Kindle edition sucks,"I like the content of this book and would give it 5 stars, but unfortunately the Kindle edition is plagued not just by the usual hard to read tables and graphs, but also lack of hyperlinks to the footnotes and tables.This book has lots of references to footnotes and tables and graphs, and without clickable links it's very awkward to refer to these and get back to your text.I recommend just getting the hard copy of this book."
5,"Weather Report at their peak, shortly before disbanding.","A great all-around effort. I wasn't really turned on a whole lot by their previous release, ""Mr. Gone"", and this was a great comeback. Buy this album, if for no other reason, the stellar performance and writing of Jaco Pastorius. ""Three Views of a Secret"" is one of the most hauntingly beautiful compositions to ever appear on a W.R. album (or any other album, for that matter). ""Fast City"" absolutely amazes me and escalates my pulse rate out of control. ""Madagascar"" tends to drag on and on, but what a great ending, building to a tremendous level of intensity. A refreshing album, not to far from the end of a landmark group's career."
3,"bad movie, hot star","This is probably one of the worst movies ever made. It has no plot, the acting stinks, and the characters are all cliches. But this movie does have one thing going for it. Pia Zadora is absolutely hot in this film. Her acting is the normal below standard but man is she easy on the eyes. My recomendation, wait till it is on skinemax at 3AM and tape it. Do not spend $50+ for this movie."
3,This anime is OK but it's nothing compared the the manga,"I have a few problems with this anime. Story changes aside my biggest problem was the way they changed the look of Gally. They turned her into a bubble eyed freak which was disappointing from the strength you see in her in the manga. If your a fan of the manga go ahead and get this anime. It can't hurt. But if you haven't seen the manga, I would suggest getting the first 2 or 3 volumes of it then viewing this, so you can get a feeling of what Gunnm(Battle Angel)is really like."
1,"Product Life Too Short, Cost Too High","This coffee maker works a great when it works, but sometimes it jams and it's a big mess to un-jam it. And then a couple of days ago it quit entirely after using it only three years. $200 is a lot of money to spend on a coffee grinder only to have it die in three years."
3,Forget the tests,"Ok....just did tests at the end of chapters 1-3.....if your criteria for success is a correlation between the text and the test...........FORGET THIS BOOK....if your criteria is learning something new in the text of the chpters...this book may have redemption...I won't know till I take the test....but I will say this...it has new info I have not found elsewhere, but still don't know if this new info will help me pass the test, which is after all the main purpose of the book......SOOOOOOO.......where do I stand on this book?.....don't know yet at this point.....BUT........has info I have not found elsewhere so for 20 bucks it may be a deal"
5,works great,The thing I like most about this griddle is it comes apart easy so you can wash it right away without the worry that water will get in the plug.
2,What are the implications,"This book makes me question all veterans who have won medals. If, as the author implies, Kerry could get medals so easily which he did not deserve then I think that all veterans who have earned medals should be questioned. Surely if Kerry could do it then probably everyone else also did the same thing. We can no longer honor any of our decorated veterans. The author of this book has tarnished them all."
1,You get what you pay for,I can see why these CD's are so [inexpensive]. They won't burn anything faster than 12x on my computer. Don't be fooled. You are basically buying slower CD's so of course they are going to be [inexpensive].
2,A Complete Waste of Time,A 2 star rating for this movie is quite generous. This 1969 production is passé. It is long and boring. I sat for 2 hours waiting for the movie to take some sort of direction. It lead nowhere. Don't waste your time and money renting this poor excuse for a film let alone buying it. DVD picture quality was sub par as well.
3,IT'S OKAY!,"It was a slow moving story. The overall premise is very good, but to me something of the story was lacking. I would have like to know how society got to that point where everyone lived in gated communities and community services such as the police department have to be paid for out of pocket etc. However, I found the character's concept of Earthseed fascinating."
4,Great air mover with low overhead,"This is a great air cleaner that moves air and filters well. the only draw back I had was that I have a small to mid size basement workshop with a 7 1/2 foot ceiling. I was going to mount this on the ceiling but would have only have had a 5 foot clearance so my next location was on the wall. So after 5 hours of rearanging some tools and taking down peg board and relocating storage I was able to place the unit at an optimum height and location. After all is said and done, great machine but if you are starting a workshop, buy this first so you can plan ahead!"
3,This Movie is something,"Now, I know buying this movie that it would probably not be very good, and I was correct. I did underestimate how little it would make sense. There is a robotic bigfoot, and a 20 minutes wrestling scene for almost no reason. That being said, I am glad I bought it, but it is not as good as JC vampire Hunter."
3,Gift for my son.,"I'm not a fan of AC/DC, my son is, but he really likes the album. As long as he doesn't blast it through the whole house it will be great."
4,I never saw it coming.,"When a movie can surprise a jaded moviegoer like me, it's managed a feat beyond reason.I won't give anything away here, but check it out."
1,Ugh...hated this overhyped book...skip it. .,"I tried, honestly I did to like this book but the story is boring and repititious and goes nowhere. I know I'm in a minority but, if you like books that have plot, skip this one. Sorry. There must be someone out there who feels as I do."
2,Read Phantoms instead,"I read Phantoms in the Brain by the same author and was wowed, so I bought this book and was sorely disappointed that it really really is a shorter, less interesting version of Phantoms in the Brain. Don't waste your time on this book just buy Phantoms in the Brain. I wish I had read the other reviews earlier that said this before I ordered it!"
5,enigma 23,"I am always amazed at those who find existence mundane and droll. It is nice to know that there are those out there who believe otherwise, if you are looking for a trip through another dimension this is your book, keep an eye out for 23 after you close the cover."
3,Somewhat Usable,"If you can get over how arrogant and condescending Nielsen is, you may get some valuable information out of this book. However, Nielsen doesn't practice what he preaches, so follow what he says in the book, not what you see at his website. Nielsen bashes graphic design regarding it as artsy feelings that can be represented elsewhere. Hey Jakob, how useful are those flaps included with the cover of the book??"
5,Straight Outta Lynwood,"Al's mission to amuse and entertain continues. Parodys are sharp, original work makes you think and laugh out loud. Al is a GENIUS!"
5,Very good,"You won't go wrong with a Panasonic DV. I've had a few models. I have several of this model for my business. They're rock solid reliable, nice and small for portability, and the quality of the recording is very good."
2,TGI over,"Robert Heinlein in the classic Citizen of the Galaxy wrote describing a bad play:""The first Krausa had been a saint with a heart of steel. Disgusted with the evil ways of fraki, he had built SIsu (single-handed, staffed it with his wife... and their remarkable children. As the play ends they jump off into space, to spread culture and wealth through the Galaxy.""This reference jumped into my mind in reading this book. I had to see what the conclusion of the series was, but was sadly disappointed. All the good guys, and their remarkable wives, are saints. In five years the world progresses from post-roman empire technology to American civil war/ WWI. Link, the evil machine, seems to have had its programing stop with Douglas Haig.Based on the first couple of books, they could have done better. Can't help but think the book was the product of opinion polls and focus groups of ten year olds."
4,Black Digiflex Exercise System - 9 Lbs,"Very well built. I was going to buy a different system but after reading someone else's review on that other brand I decided it wasn't very well built. When comparing features with this one and the other brand, the digiflex does not have ""ridges"" to help a guitarist build finger callouses, but I certainly don't need that as I have plenty of my own! I bought it primarily for guitar fretting hand strengthening and guessed on the poundage. Nine pounds is a bit stiff for my smaller fingers (ring and pinky), but great for the bigger fingers (I'm 56); however, I'm sure I'll appreciate the strength later on. Also, it's a bit difficult to do thumb exercises, but I suppose it's better than most. Though I have not yet used the other brands, I believe this one is the best on the market. If 9 pounds is too strong for you, remember that they make a variety of strengths."
2,"will NEVER flip, but...","What you read is true. the canopy of this umbrella is durable and will never flip on you. HOWEVER......the handle is not ergonimic, made of a cheap wooden/plastic blend material that's really uncomfortable to hold, and slips easy out of your hand in moderate winds if wet. handle eventually broke and the metal wires that keep the umbrella open all popped out of their protective pegs so i risked poking myself or someone else in the eye every time i used it.no auto-close. The windproof is great, but what good is that if the rest of the umbrella breaks on you so easily?"
2,Not up to Patterson's Par,I read everything that James Patterson writes and I must say I was very disappointed with 2nd chance. It was like he just threw it together to sell another book. Certainly not one of his better offerings.
1,"Too much American pop culture and commercialism, not enough of real National Geographic.","My daughter received this magazine for one year as a gift and I was so disappointed with the layout and quality of information. It is bright and fun looking, but every issue had bits of disjointed information in a sea of commercialism. I did find a few articles were interesting and age appropriate, although they were rather shallow. I remember one issue, our second one, that focused on Star Wars...and although I am a sci-fi fan, I hoping my daughter would be learning about animals and other real-life cultures, not about movies! I was disappointed that it focuses so much on the American pop culture.Honestly, there are much better quality magazines for children."
4,GOOD BOOK,First of all this book was sad and mysterious. I feel bad for the Baudelaires but the book was very good.
1,Who butchered this great movie?,Goodtimes video has butchered this great movie. Sometimes the person talking is not in focus or even on the screen. Some scenes are missing. I can't take it back for mine was a gift. Make sure you buy the version authorized by the Wayne estate if you want the real movie with all of the scenes included. I have that copy on VHS. Sorry to say I have not yet found it on DVD.
1,Not getting the hang of it :(,"Got this for my daughter for Christmas because a friend of her's had one and she really wanted it. Very disapointed so far. Does not do anything even as well as the straighteners and curling irons we already had. Not getting the hang of the spiral curler at all, maybe we need more practice, but it is not easy to use."
1,DVD was junk,This DVD was clearly repaired to cover up scratches. It skips a lot and the DVD menu freezes if you try to do anything but play the movie. There was 2 whole parts of the movie missing!?! Just glad my 2 year old doesn't mind to much
1,The horror... the horror...,"Okay, I admit I have not purchased this item... but seriously, take a look at that picture! These 'decorations' are hideous looking. I think I know which one is meant to be Ringo, but I honestly have no idea about the others. I'm pretty sure no one will ever buy this, so my review is irrelevant. I just find this item to be deeply disturbing and I really wish I would never have stumbled upon it."
1,Terrible CD,"The things that made the last album great are missing here. 1. The beats aren't as great. 2. They lost an MC. 3. The great artists featured are gone. 4. the content is all the same.I didn't like the lyrical content at all to begin with, but the genius of the production made me want to listen. I still have Violent By Design in my heavy ratation. So now we have over a dozen tracks of Vinnie Paz telling us how crazy, mad and anti-semetic he is. And it's not counterpoint to Jus Allah who's style made Vinnie sound more impressive. Before, where Vinnie changed his flow from track to track, now it's all the same. An MC screaming over a track, not flowing well with the music, talking about offensive subjects on beats that aren't ground breaking. Doesn't sound like a good CD to me. And it won't to you either. If you like Stoupe's production, go get the Canibus' CD ""Rip the Jacker"" Produced by Stoupe and you'll hear better rhyme skills, better content and an overall better CD."
5,Love it!,"I have had many vaccuum cleaners...from the cheapest to Dyson and Oreck.This one I love the most. It is simple to use and does the job well. It's easy to clean furniture, lamp shades with the attachment.It's easy to empty.What more can I say? I highly reccomend it."
3,The First Is The Best!,"I, like others who reviewed this, didn't like the second version, but loved the first one. I think Hayley MIlls is wonderful, then and now!"
1,am radio loop,"tried on to differnt radio,s, didn,t help at all. one was a boise with built in antenna, the other was apanosonic which l could plug in and that help was so minute it didnt matter"
3,"12 volts from ""the wall""","This adapter plugs into the wall and turns out 12volts just like your in-car plugs. It is effective and looks reliable (I haven't had it long enough to rate lifetime). It does get pretty hot, so you need to be careful not to let the cords sit on top of the adapter while in use"
4,"Nicely Done, but...","Cambodians I have spoken with about The Elephant Walk Restaurant (upon which this cookbook is based) have been disappointed in the restaurant's high prices, and believe that much of the food does not represent traditional Cambodian fare. They have also commented on the lack of warmth exhibited by the owners towards less than aristocratic Cambodian patrons, and suggested the food has been modified to appeal to the American palate. As such, chances are you won't find many Cambodians eating at The Elephant Walk.Having said this, I have always enjoyed the flavorful and beautifully presented meals at The Elephant Walk Restaurant. The recipes in this cookbook look very tempting, and the photography is beautifully done."
5,"Wonderful, wonderful book!","I enjoyed Make Lemonade (the first book) and sought out this one, the second in the trilogy. This one was even better than the first! LaVaughn is fifteen now, and her life is changing as her best friends have discovered religion (Cross Your Legs for Jesus), her mom is dating after ten years of widowhood, and her childhood friend Jody (now gorgeously handsome) has moved back into her building. Her goal to get to college is stronger than ever, but obstacles keep popping up in her life, wearing her down, until she feels like she just can't take anymore. A wonderfully touching book filled with wry humor, Wolff succeeds once again with her poetic style of writing about teenage life. (I just hope the last book in the trilogy doesn't take another 8 years to write.)"
5,Works Great!,"So far this has been a great product, my daughter reported that her lunch was still steaming not just warm! Hopefully it maintains this and doesn't quit as it gets older."
4,Dream a Little Dream,Susan Elizabeth Phillips writes with a fresh and curent kind of dialogue Dream a little Dream is easy to read but does hold ones interest.
3,sound quality problem,This review is not of the film but rather the Amazon streaming. We only watched a few minutes as the sound quality of the Amazon streaming was not very good. It would be extremely helpful if Amazon Video On demand offered the opportunity to watch the captions/subtitles. Netflix does offer subtitle control on the new Roku.
5,Electrolux Vacuum Filter Pack,It was nice to be able to get new parts to replace a couple of parts that had broke on the vacuum cleaner.
3,"good for the table, not for cooking","I give this grinder 3 stars because the idea is so darn clever... adjustable grind size, and both salt AND pepper in one device. It's kind of fun twisting from the salt side to the pepper side too.Unfortunately, all the complaints of output amount are true. I find that almost no salt comes out unless it's set to the coarsest grind. I can get a fine grind of pepper, but again, it just creates a faint dusting. When I seasoned a pot of mashed potatoes, my hand got so tired that I had to ask someone else to finish grinding.Also, I'm not sure exactly how it works, but it seems to leave a lot of what's been ground inside the chamber, which means I don't get 100% freshly ground pepper, thereby defeating the entire point.It's not TERRIBLE, but I plan to keep this on my table, and get another, more functional grinder for the kitchen."
4,Excellent except for one thing...,"I just got this player today and this is a fantastic unit capable of nearly every possible feature your full-sized DVD home theater player can do except one very important thing (to me)...it doesn't appear to have a ""Random"" or ""Shuffle"" option for audio CDs/MP3 CD/DVDs. So when you put a DVD in there with 1200 MP3s on it, it will start on track 1 every time - no way to make it random. This is a huge oversight in my opinion. If I'm somehow missing how to do this - please email me at [...]because I cannot find the option anywhere within the unit menus or the manual."
3,Enough Already,"Please. Could this man praise himself or ex-Mayor Giuliani any more? While Mr. Kerik's story is inspirational in some respects, the constant pats on the back that he gives himself are a real turn off. I got the message after the initial string of self-compliments ... this is a great man doing great things. There's no need to hear it ad nauseum. Yes, and he also lets us know what a great man Giuliani is. Maybe. Maybe not. This book is filled with all sorts of macho stuff with the forces of good fighting the forces of evil. Kerik has filled the pages with a lot of interesting stories and has clearly established himself as a superman on the side of the good."
2,A Poor Clanbook,"Clan Gangrel is probably one of my favorite clans for Vampire: The Masquerade, but this book hardly does them justice, or provides anything helpful. Way too much focus on Lupines (although the inaccurate details are a nice touch), way too much. Maybe it's a fine book if you just have a Lupine Impersonator concept, but otherwise, pass it up. If the Gangrel were as this book implies, they'd be living alone in the woods, hanging out with werewolves; they'd never need or desire companionship with other clans, especially in a city."
4,works for me,I choose this item to wear while sleeping and it's helped. It's strong and adjustable. Would be noticable if worn under clothes.
4,Rebuilding the world.,"Wells is one of the freshest and most talented fantasy writers working today, and I enjoyed _Wheel of the Infinite_ immensely. The City is loosely based on Angor Wat and the reader will catch whispers of Asian and Southeast Asian mythology throughout the book.Maskelle is a refreshing character in the fantasy genre-- an assertive older woman who has come into power and knows her own mind. The other characters are equally well-fleshed out with many deft and light touches that keep the tone from getting too dark.I was not completely willing to buy the ending-- a little bit too much Deus ex Machina, and that weakened the book for me. But still, it was a very good read and a commendable stand-alone fantasy novel."
2,Saturnalia,"After reading this book, I found that I did not particulary like it. That may be because I am not a very big historical fiction fan, or maybe because I did not click with it. In othere words, I thought that this book was not of interest and would advise people not to read it unless they enjoy historical fiction very, very much.The story is about an Indian, not a Native American, named William. He is an apprentice in a printing shop. Saturnalia is an old holiday celebrated by his masters. During this time, the serving people trade places with their masters.Also, the revenge the tithingman is trying to place apon William. Another character is a man who is lovesick and wants to win the heart of of a widowed woman. He tells his apprentice Malcolm to deliver gifts to her, but Malcolm gives the better ones to a heartless serving maid."
3,The recipes from the Betsy-Tacy books,"My favorite Maud Hart Lovelace book is Betsy's Wedding and I was very happy to find a recipe for Lady Baltimore Cake. I don't think that I will be making any of these recipes and I am not sure it was worth ten dollars but it's nice to know that pre-gadgetry, cakes were being churned out; that eases my baking anxiety."
4,GET THIS BOOK NOW!!,"This was a very good book. I am convinced the characters are REAL (I'm sure the names have been changed). This book was very interesting. The only part I did not like was Milena's occupation. Zane, this was an excellent book!! I was reading on my Kindle at home and reading it everywhere else on my cell phone's Kindle APP (shhhhhh!!; keep that part quiet). I could not put this one down. I can't wait for Zane's next book. Lydia was very ""colorful"". Yosef was interesting. OK, just read the book. It's very good."
1,just a big advertisement for their clinic,"if you were looking for a how-to in treating this condition, look elsewhere. This book is nothing but a big advertisement for their clinic and a bunch of personal stories. Here is all they tell you: their technique is called the Five Penetrations of Life and it involves a finger, tampon, applicator with medicine, intercourse, or gynecologic exam. That's it. That's all they reveal. Not for people who neither have the time or money to fly to their clinic in New York."
3,sucks,This movie is about people who go to a trpoical island to film there two surfers but this movie has a bad plot and the salt water crocodile looks very fake and computer animized It is all true take my advice and dont buy this movie to watch bad characters and a really fake croc!!!!!!!!
2,inconsistent at best,"Best track: ""Gett Off"" There are two or three other okay songs here (like ""Cream"", ""Daddy Pop"", ""Money dont matter tonight""). I used to really hate this album back when it came out, but have grown to tolerate it in the wake of Prince's artistic demise. It's far better than much of the antiseptic, boring material he churns out these days."
1,Horrible,"Boring Boring BORING!! Unless you like that watered-down over-done mellow britpop a la Coldplay (which are far more emotionally satisfying), Travis (which are phenominal songwriters), or Radiohead (there is no comparison to one of the greatest bands of all time). Those are good bands, but imagine a band trying to sound like them, but without good songs and totally dull and lifeless. Then you get Starsailor. Be happy."
1,Worst Book Ever,"Haven't read any of Danielle Steel's books in a long time because I was tired of the same old story over and over again. I decided to give her another try and picked this one up used. Waste of my $3.00, waste of my time spent reading it. Horrible story line, predictable main character again. Will never read another of her books."
4,Absolute Awesomeness,"Ok. So I go out and get this game and the first thing I notice is that there are 5 discs!So installing takes about 15 minutes (on a not-too-stellar computer)I start playing and notice the awesome graphics and sound.IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE ARE GUNFIGHTS HAPPENING IN YOUR LIVING ROOMAnyway, The voice acting isn't too great, but that is easily overlooked.I start playing the first mission and I have to reload around the 5th checkpoint like 20 times!The game is ridiculously hard because of the crazy AI.The enemies in this game are like super-smart and they killed me over and over and over.This game is addicting. Even though I kept losing, I kept replaying until I won.The bottom line:Great sound, bad voice acting, ridiculously smart AI, AWESOME"
4,Great DVD Cabinet,"I bought this cabinet because I felt it offered the best value for the price. Also, I liked the look of it. The only downside is that my husband said it was kind of a pain to put together."
1,That's Enough,"After hearing this on the radio,i thought this was ok.But now it's on all the time.The song is really bad,and has gotten old already.Nine Days is the worst thing that ive heard since Sixpence none The Richer,but Macy Gray is the worst.Anyway,save your money,"
5,Wonderful,"I have never cared much for novels that involve ""alternate realities"". By alternate reality, I mean that the book involves the paranormal/supernatural in everyday life. The characters are fully aware that creatures such as werewolves and magic exist; the world in the novel now excepts such oddities as being normal. However, once I began to read this book, I couldn't put it down. It drew me into a fantasy world, which the author has flawlessly created. The novel is filled with suspense and romance. I can not wait until the sequel.I won't explain the plot of the novel, since others on here have. But, if you enjoy suspense, romance (especially the concept of ""soulmates""), and the supernatural, then this book is for you. I promise that you will love it!"
2,Kindle Version,"Love the story. BUT the editing was awful!! One of main characters was named 'Riker', we got ""Piker"" instead. Not so bad, easy to figure out. A question was asked and the answer was ""Nof."" These are just two of 15 to 20 errors. Very distracting from the story and the Kindle product."
4,Britney's Feel-Good Pop,"Well, I am hated for my opinion of this CD, but I love it. While Britney is simply a manufactured bubblegum singer, and a manufactered teen sex symbol, this CD is plain fun to listen to. I love ""Oops..."", ""Lucky,"" ""One Kiss from You,"" ""what you see,"" ""Stronger,"" and ""Can't make you Love me."" I dislike Britney's much-talked about cover of ""Satisfaction,"" but that is the only sore spot for me. I love to sit and listen to this CD when I feel like smiling or just goofing around. Some people will dislike the strained vocals Britney delivers, as well as the many effects that are used on her voice. This is not a CD for people that love strong vocals ONLY. I'm a stickler for a great leading voice (Celine Dion, Bono, Pat Monahan of Train), but I still appreciate a good, catchy pop song. Bottom line: if you like feel-good pop music, you'll love this CD."
1,golf mind link,I was sadly disappointed with this video. The price... did not match the quality. Save your money and buy a lesson!
1,Didn't need a hammer and fell apart.,I gave this to my grandson for Christmas. The pegs pushed right through with a light touch of the finger and the red ends fell off the first day like they weren't glued on very well. I was really disappointed. Usually this brand is much better.
3,leeds united marching on together,"with robert pollard he does what it says on the tin .been a fan for a good while now ,he needs to stop churning out the cds for the sake of it .how ever like this sound anyway."
1,No Zing in my Ring!!!,"Save your money!!! Impossible to use. After wasting 4 hours trying to create 1 ringtone, I took the disc and converted it into a coaster. Try something else."
2,Not Worth It!,"I am a public administration student in a top ranked gradute program. This book was one course's required textbook and only because the editior, Anthony Kovner, was the instructor. While few students enjoyed the course, no one felt that this book is worth purchase. The only people that I would recommend this book to are foreign graduate students who have no working knowledge whatsoever about the US healthcare system. Otherwise, there are numerous books on the market that are cheaper and much more informative and intellectual."
5,Amazing!,"This book, along with Picoult's others, has so many twists and turns, I had a hard time putting it down. The book was wonderfully written with so much historical and medical accuracy. It was well thought out, planned, and researched. Abosolutely loved it."
2,Disingenuousness,"I must state upfront that I only read a small portion of this book, just to get the ""flavor"" of it. It left a bad taste! In his chapter on evolution, he tosses in a couple quotes by Keith Ward, who is a THEOLOGIAN. Deloria cites an inconsistency in Ward's (ignorant) statements about evolution, and tries to use that inconsistency as a criticism of evolution itself. This is, at best, very sloppy writing, and arguably dishonest."
4,Haiku for the rest of us,"Sometimes, traditional haiku bores me. Mentions of the season, nature, etc.However, this book lends lighthearted humor to the poetry style.Enjoyed it then passed it along to a friend."
3,Too much plodding,"I was really surprised that Eastwood would allow this film to cruise along on such a low level of energy. Kevin Spacey is perfect in his role, Cusack so-so, and the Lady Chablis steals the scene. The quirky charm of the setting carries the movie along, but there is no tension or real anticipation to involve the viewer. The Cusack character evoked no empathy from me, he seemed a total mercenary, and that was crucial in dissapating whatever momentum the movie DID manage to develop. I was certainly hoping for better."
5,Big Shoes,"This is one of the best books about fathers I have ever read. It is a good variety of people not just stars but authors, etc. And the stories are not all happy but are honest and the fathers all taught or left the authors with lessons and or memories that they have carried with them and now shared with us. And Al so nicely compiled for us. It is a great read and a great gift for husbands, brothers or sons. It is a good re-read so a good keeper for the book shelf."
2,Long and Dry,"I picked up this book based on a shining recommendation from a friend. Because I downloaded it, I didn't realise it was as lengthy as it was until I spotted it in a bookstore, although length doesn't typically bother me, especially when I'm hauling all the pages around on an e-reader. I made it two and a half chapters in before I had to set it aside and chalk it up as a lost cause. I simply can't get past the unnecessary details and the overall dryness with which it's written. I found (and, when I go back to try again, still find) myself zoning out while I'm still reading, acknowledging words but not stringing them together into meaningful sentences, and I don't know that any of the characters are have enough character to make it worth continuing. I hear Dan Simmons has better books; I'm not sure this hasn't put me off him entirely, but this was a poor introduction to his storytelling and has made me wary of any of his other novels."
2,FOOL'S GOLD,MOVIE IS NOT ALL ON ONE SIDE OF DISCHAVE TO TURN OVER IN MIDDLE OF MOVIETHE MOVIE IS GREAT BUT I AM DISAPPOINTED IN DISC
1,Geo's Tome,This does not help anyone. Everyone around me is committing suicide to this book. It's awful... awfully good... awfully good to die to.
5,"Interesting stories, well told","If these stories of women who made a difference despite all odds don't inspire you to achieve to your fullest potential, it's doubtfull that anything else can. The spectrum of women chosen is a testament to diversity. This would make a great holiday gift for anyone and everyone."
3,Shadow..,"I'm not a pro but let me tell you where I think is the issue with this hood. I have 18-200 lens (SAL18200) and when I take shots at 18mm with this lens i.e completely zoomed out, I get a shadow from the hood in my pictures. This is when I'm using camera's built in flash.I'm planning to buy HVL-56AM flash and I believe the problem should go away. Hope this helps someone.Trushar Mistry"
5,Would like to purchase,This looks very promising -- reminds me of Leverage. I would LOVE to purchase this series if/when amazon ever makes it available.
1,Hewitt is horrible. Story is inaccurate! The list goes on.,"First, I will give Jennifer Love Hewitt some credit... She did a wonderful job at slaughtering the story of a true film icon. But then, what do you expect from the co-executive producer who just happened to cast herself in the lead? Hewitt makes no secret that she's an Audrey wanna-be, and this movie just shows how hard she'll try (and how much money she'll spend) to be Audrey.I agree 100% with the reviewer that mentioned she would have rather seen a ""documentary style special."" So much of the 'Audrey Hepburn Story' is not even accurate and I think its a shame! Get the real Audrey story from RELIABLE sources... like A&E's biography or Lifetime's Intimate Portrait!"
1,Islad of the blue dolphins,WOW THIS BOOK WAS SOO BAD! IF I COULD I WOULDN'T GIVE IT A STAR! I mean there are way to many books about kids getting stuck on islands. Someone told me if I liked the movie Cast away with Tom Hanks I would love this. Boy were they wrong this book [was really bad]! Her brother is the reason that she stays on the island. The ships begin to sail away but her brother forgot something. He goes back to get it but he can't catch up. The captin wont slow down.So the girl jumps out into the water to stay with him. He wants to see the wild dogs on the island because he never seen them before. He had lived on the island all his life and he knew that they were not nice. But he trys to kill one because they begin to starve! He ends up dying because a dog eats him! Man it [is bad]. Do not read this! I mean dont you think that they would know how to survive on an island that they have lived on there entire life!
5,Fortunate for Bob,Wow! This CD is amazing! I listened to it at the listening station in Circuit City because I recognized him from the TV show the Bachelor. I was totally prepared to hate it...but I changed my mind immediately after listening to the first three tracks! He has incredible talent! I LOVED IT and I can't stop listening to it! Hats off to Bob! Can't wait to see you in concert!
2,No substance,Entire movie is about Jeremy Renner trying to get pills. Little to no plot or substance. Chase scene at the end of the movie seems to last for about 40 minutes. One of the worst big budget movies that I have ever seen. Save your $5 and rent something else.
5,WOW,"I enjoy listening to the Cozad singers. They bring out the best in the Gourd Dance music. They know how to honor the American Veterans with their traditional Gourd Dance music. When playing this CD, it just wants to make you get up and begin dancing. Hard to keep the feet still."
5,"I didn't think it would happen, but I'm happy it did!!!","Well, isn't this fantastic. American Idol Winner Kelly Clarkson comes out with an album- one some say was destined to flop- and she has over 250,000 buys the first week... Pretty amazing, but really, was it worth it? Was all the hype true? I had to see for myself.I purchased the rather plain covered cd, and had a listen... I was shocked at the diversity of the songs and the true originality of the themes. Everything on this CD is worth a listen, and I must admit, unlike the Single-CD, I find myself humming these catchy tunes throughout my day.I didn't think it was going to happen, but I'm soooo very happy that it did.Favorite Song: Beautiful Disaster, ThankfulLeast Favorite Song: The trouble with love (still good)Total rating: 9.3/10.0"
2,Dust Everywhere,"I tried this product after using Arm & Hammer, Tidy Cats, and at least one other brand. My cat is not picky about his food or litter and has never missed his litter box. I slowly integrated this litter with Arm & Hammer Litter and it wasn't until it was nearly completely World's Best Cat Litter that he decided to take a dump less than two inches away from his designated area.This has never happened before but luckily that was the only incident. Looking over it, I still can't find many reasons to continue purchasing this brand. It tracks EVERYWHERE. I have a black table nearby my cat's litter box and it looks like someone dropped corn flour every time my cat exits his designated area. The odor control is mediocre at best.I do not recommend this litter nor will I be repurchasing this brand."
1,disappointed,"I'm not sure if I would have enjoyed my purchase since I never received it...I did get one if the three books by mail, but not the other 2...certainly not a boxed set..."
2,I must have gotten a bad pair,"Mine were TERRIBLE. Focus is impossible! Focus adjustment is rough and sticks. If you try to fine focus, you go right past where you want to be..I thought these would be good binocs from the other reviews. The body is metal, but the eyepiece assemblies are completely PLASTIC. They warp and they are not quality. Even the eyepiece ""lenses"" are plastic, not glass. The main objectives are glass, but the eyepiece lenses are plastic. That's not quality in my book. I wanted to send them for repair, but Pentax wants me to pay $25 AND shipping, to repair them! That's not a warranty, it's highway robbery!.Never again Pentax!"
4,Great for quick slide reference,"Have to supply your own light bulb. The plastic display was marred, but does not appear to affect the viewing of slides. Like the way it folds for storage"
4,a dancing breeze,"spirited away, despite being anime (one of my pet hates), is a great movie. filled with childish charm, its gives you warm-fuzzies without disney sentimentality"
3,could be better,"When i received the saw the first thing I noticed was the dust that covered the case. Next was the warranty card was for the 1990's, I emailed the seller with my concerns and he answered that I could return the tool if I had any trouble with it. Sounds fair to me. I've only used the saw twice,it has more than enough power and ,so far the battery is fine. The one thing that suprised me was the second time I took the saw out of the case I found 2 of the screws that hold on the base laying in bottom of the case. I have never had a fastner loose on any makita tool before this. Time will tell."
5,Rebirth of the Mind,"This CD will make you think. And if we start to think, change will happen. Gandhi and Malclom X would be proud."
5,Do You Believe In Ghosts?,"Have you ever been a skeptic about whether ghosts exist or not? After reading this book, it will make you think about the possibilities of science research. This book was very entertaining and kept me on the edge of my seat throughout most of the book. The way the author builds suspense is quite genius, and the plot creates questions in your own mind of what ifs. Even though the book is fiction, it makes you wonder about the craziness of others who want to make an impact on the world and what they might do to be successful!"
4,Plum Island,"Thoroughly enjoyed this book! Lots of detail, twists and turns. I've read his books before and have enjoyed all of them. Enjoy!"
4,Mother loved it.,My mother loved this. It was very entertaining and she loves the actors. IT was a litle different than she is use to but enjoyed.
5,Exactly what I wanted,"Lighting fast shipping, exactly what I needed at a crucial moment! Very impressed how quickly I received this product at an international APO address."
5,"Excellent CD; in Spanish, using only acoustic instruments.","The songs on this recording are traditional Mexican canciones played on traditional Mexican acoustic instruments such as the guitarra, requinto, guitarron, vihuela, tololoche, acordeon, and violin. Each song's verses are printed in the liner notes in Spanish and in English. Very good."
4,another dope release from a doper artist known as Killah Priest,"""View From Masada"", hits me as a second chapter of his crittically acclaimed debut ""Heavy Mental"". every track bangs and he even worked with Just Blaze before he blew up, which i think is a plus. every track also is a lesson of it own contemplation. for example ""Gotta Eat"" is the struggle track along with ""Hard Times"" are both great at capturing the urban struggle. then you have ""What Part of The Game?"" is a track dissing the fakeness in the industry with Ras Kass providing his own unique perspective along with ""Bop Your Head"" feat Canibus showing how to tear apart phony emcees. both emcees rip the track with ease. to those who wanted the same actual fact type ideogram of lp that Priest bought for previously i'm sorry this is the next best thing. favorite tracks on ""View From Masada"" are1.Whut Part of The Game?2.Bop Your Head3.Rap Legend4.Live by the gun5.I'm Wit That"
5,100 % Cliff,This DVD is one of the best collection of Metallica if you are truelly fan you will see the routs of Heavy Metal back in the eithys!!!!
3,Definitely Not GR1,"A lot of the 3 star reviews listed here are ""spot on"" as our British friends would say. The concept of moving your 2 teams into position (like in GR1) to take out a target is NOT present in this game. I stopped sending guys to the left or right because it was mostly a death sentence for them or myself. I kept the team tight in the hopes that they would hit targets that I either missed or didn't see. But the most disappoint event came at the end of the game. I was in a huge firefight when command told me that an ""event"" was happening...I prepared for it by switching weapons and fired 1 shot...and next thing I knew the mission was over I had won, game over. I thought ""HUH?!? you got to be kidding me...this game was really hard for me and THAT'S how it ends?"" I'm still in a bit of disbelief and want to check a strategy guide to see if there is more to it. Maybe events happen because I was too cautious? I don't know."
4,Apple peeler,This is A gift for my Brother I hope he like it.He loves to bake apple pies and this will help him A lot.
5,I cannot get enough of her show!!!,She's so excellent I can't tell you enough. I watch her shows on PBS and from this DVD set over and over. I just wish she will present more new material in the future. Yay for Joanne Weir!
5,A Christmas Classic,This is a timeless Christmas classic that still brings a lump to your throat. The music from this special is wonderful as well. A classic!
4,A Great Primer,"This is a great book to have on hand if you cast a lot of spells. It's loaded wtih wonderful information and includes acceptable substitutes. As a beginning caster, I'm a little overwhelmed, but I can see where this is going to be one of my most consulted tomes."
2,Most of these singers need to get with the program.,"This CD is Koo because you get all of the collection for 25 dolllars. BUT, out of all 4 CD's excluding the Euro Invasion(forget about those euro invasion cd'd) there are enough songs to probably make 1 good cd. I'll break it down: A lot of songs don't belong on this CD, and they ain't from Canada and make the CD look good. Goods songs are Disc One: tracks 1,2,17,19,20. Disc Two: 2,8(P.S #7 the ughy hughy dughy song is hella gay. Disc Three: 2,4,7,9,10,15, Disc Four: 1,2,3,4,10,11,12,13,15(Best CD). all other songs either were used and has nothing to do with freestyle heaven or are straight up bogussssssss!"
3,good but not the best,the hell in a cell was my favorite an end to the greatest rivalry yeah right beniot v.s.kane was good but somewhat boring eugene can just go back home no one likes um the other matches were cool i seen it on ppv and i always buy all new wwe dvds
4,Another expansive eclectic work by the Furries,"At first this album came as a let-down, as few songs seemed to grab me. I guess all I was after was the pop sound of Northern Lites, the fast guitars of Do Or Die and The Teacher, and the aching balladry of Fire in my Heart. But repeated listens reveal some good stuff. The Door To This House Remains Open and Some Things Come From Nothing do indeed show a hint of their roots in techno (they always said they weren't keen on Britpop, although lazy hacks around the world lumped them in with it), which makes for something unique and fresh, and the use of unusual often exotic instrumentation ensures that as UK guitar music falls into a rut, SFAs will be spared. Check out their latest release, Mwng, which is entirely sung in Welsh, for something even more experimental."
2,Bitter Apple,Can not smell bitter apple. Pretty sure it is not working as cat still cratching on sofa. Does not seem like a smart purchase item.
2,A Vienna Tour Guide?,"Sorry, I don't speak German very well, and there is no English subtitle available. I only comment on what I visually percepted.All I saw was spots of Vienna you should go if you are on a Vienna music tour. Some movements of Mahler's symphonies were even entirely played with the pace of the film completely stopped.Mahler himself is vaguely visible. The film put too much focus on Natalie Bauer-Lechner and Anna von Mildenberg; and unforgiveably ignored another two women whom Gustav also considered important: Justi Mahler and Anna Mahler, not to say other musicians like Richard Strauss, Hans von Burlow, Jean Silbelius or Bruno Walter. Mahler's vision of music was also ignored."
2,What a waste of my time!,"Having recently immersed myself in Regencies, I began reading this title. Several hours later I said out loud, ""I am sick and tired of this girl!"" The pace was slow-moving and neither the hero nor the heroine were behaving within the Regency parameters befitting a ""gentleman"" or a ""lady"". All he did was lay down orders that she dramatically flaunted; it was like watching an extremely tedious tennis match. I skipped half the book and read the ending, to find out that even then the same overbearing/lack of trust issues were still active. It really is amazing how her writing has improved through the years and what a shame it is that publishers will re-release a substandard book trying to get a little extra money. It makes me especially glad that I was able to borrow this one and didn't actually have to buy it to find this out. Read her more recent ones-they are MUCH better."
3,weird ending,This was a great read up until the very end. The characters are very sympathetic and believable up until then. Strong characters turn weak and act totally out of character in the final pages. Weird. Can't imagine why Binchy couldn't figure out a better way to wrap things up.
2,Not Worth Ordering,Very light weight and the non-stick surface does not work well. Spend more and go for a better skillet.
2,Ultimately disappointed,"At first glance, it appeared this measuring tape might be a triumph of design; a masterpiece of function. But substandard construction quality has left me unsatisfied. The bolt holding the two halves together was very loose, almost allowing the device to fall in two (which could have been very inconvenient, considering there's a spring under tension inside). Tightening the bolt was tricky, as it requires a hex wrench, not a screwdriver. In addition, the tab at the end of the tape is very loose, which could affect measurements by and eighth or a sixteenth of an inch. A measuring tape that's not completely accurate? How about applying some ""function over form"" here?"
3,"this is an overall, alright book","I had to read this book for a class. If I would have picked up this book to read on my own, I probably would have stopped about 2 pages into it. The introduction lasts for half of the book and it is hard to understand in some places. However the strategies this book teaches you are very good and can be very usefull. I wouldnt recommend this book to someone looking for a book to read for pleasure, I think that this book would be most efficient if it was to be taught in a class, than read personally.Overall I liked the book, and if your looking to get ahead in life, i suggest you read it too."
2,"Score for Kindle edition on iPhone, NOT for Crowley's work","I have this work as a real book and treasure it for the clarity of its information around correspondences between everything from Hebrew letters to colors to herbs to planets, etc. Amazing piece of work, and even in book form it's clearly something that took a lot of care and understanding to lay out on consecutive pages. Not an easy task.The problem here is that at least when looking at the Kindle edition on my iPhone, there is no Hebrew character set, so there is a lot of confusing gobble-d-gunk. Beyond that, scrolling from page to page on a screen is not the same as thumbing back and forth between, say, page 16 and page 20 of a book. There is linear and jump-to browsing, which is really different than reading an actual book.But this is paradigm shifting stuff and maybe I'm just too old. The real problem still remains: no Hebrew character set. This makes this edition, at least on the iPhone, nearly useless."
4,A Really Good Purchase,"If what your looking for is a compact quality binocular, this is a great choice: The engineering is tight and the lens are very good. It is light and easy to focus. I thought the price ($20) was a sign to stay away, not so, I am completely satisfied."
3,Excellent book of course...,"I enjoyed this book; however, I don't think it was BeBe Moore-Campbell's best. The challenges faced by the characters were realistic, but the ending about the business was a bit unreal."
5,Good music.,Flash back from my childhood! Party Tyme is always a great purchase. I own 1- 17 and love all of them. Love this music!!
3,ok,"not super padded but i bought them for a Bane Halloween costume so.... as far as fighting in them, well, IDK. They don;t seem likethey would cushion too much of a blow."
1,A disappointing novel with TV-movie plot,"This novel was a major disappointment, especially after reading a positive review of the book. The point of view alternates among several individuals involved with the small boy, including that of the boy itself--if you like reams and reams of baby-talk, then this book is for you. Grown-ups would have preferred that the author had fashioned a less predictable plot (conflict over custody between black and white grandparents) that seems calculated for a movie or TV sale. Skip the book and wait for the film."
5,Marble Mouse Mania,"The Marble Mouse is not for the ""set in my ways"" sort. MM's are so superior in versatility, comfort and space saving design, that there is virtually no comparison with old style mice.If you work in Photoshop, CAD or any design program, the marble mouse is absolutely the only way to fly!!!"
3,"Should be called ""Sierra Middle"" - it doesn't get to the Northern Sierra!","The book & reviews are pretty good (per the other reviewer's comments and my initial look-through), but I was very very disappointed to find out that this book does not really cover any area north of HWY 80 (or actually it just squeeks by with Castle Peak).That means it is missing a *huge* chunk of the northern Sierra Nevada wilderness - Sierra Buttes, Feather River, Gold Lake area, and so on...all the way up to where the Sierra Nevada really ends (up towards Mt. Lassen, depending on which source you read).I'll upload a rear-cover image...take a close look at the red outline showing the area the book covers. If you want to backpack or hike north of HWY 80, get a different book!Cheers,-J"
1,Ehh...,"This is a good game... for 5 minutes. It is just pacman..Nothing special. The arcade version is much better. Although the price for this is cheap, its not worth the 3.99 shipping."
2,Odd Movie,"I really didn't care for this movie. I am a huge fan of John Candy (and Tom Hanks), but some of the movies he made were not very good. I made the mistake of getting this one mixed up with another one he made that I enjoyed so much more. Tom Hanks portrayed a spoiled rich guy in this one and was not very convincing at it. I found it really hard to watch it all of the way through it. I wouldn't recommend it."
5,Unbelievable!,"For the size of this product you will be amazed at the way it cleans. I love this product. It's light, easy to you and cleans GREAT! I'm glad I got it."
2,ok,a bit obnoxious...tells you what every rts/t game _has_ to have and how great he and his code is.Some extremely biased opinions. Doesn't explain the tons of code in detail. Not for the inexperienced programmer at all. Puny puny cd...just the code...no game examples...nothing on how to pull it all together to create a game.
1,Do not end up purchasing a new car lik I did!,DO NOT LEAVE THIS TEE IN YOUR TRUNK!! I noticed stange smell in my car shortly after I purchased this tee and placed it in my trunk with the rest of my sons baseball equipment. The only problem is that I was not able to figure out what was causing the smell until 4 days after we gave in and traded in our car for a new one. LEAVE THIS TEE OUTSIDE. It is was beginning to make our garage stink.
1,UGH!,"The dialogue is so full of cliches, I struggled to make it through this one. As other reviewers have stated, the amber story line was hard to follow, and the characters were so un-realistic. What was supposed to have been clever banter between our hero and heroine left me feeling embarrassed for an author who has such a pathetic perception of wit. I bought this and the sequel on the same day, so I tried Jade . . . something or other . . . next. SAME REACTION! Same characters, new names. Same dialogue, absence of wit. BIG disappointment times two."
4,Still waiting...,I still have not received this after over a month; I only gave it a good review score because I have read/played this book/game before and it is really good.
2,The Bad Road of Singing,"Everybody's about to forget about JoJo (Joanna Levesque), and we know why. Too Little Too Late was actually the only number one hit for Billboard Charts from this album. Throughout her own life, ""Breezy"", ""Leave (Get Out)"" and ""Baby It's You"" are probably the only greatly known songs she's successful for. Now that's doing a singing business really poor. Joanna is going to be named, ""Booanna Loseque"" if she does not get her singing to be awesome. If anybody agrees with me, don't buy this album or ignore this message."
1,Not Worth Buying,"My husband bought these at a store, without reading online reviews. They don't suction well, the lids are hard to seal, and the Nuby bowls with lids are easier to store. Save your money."
2,Not a professional unit,"Up front, I'll tell you that I sent it back, even with the return shipment charges ($28). This is a flimsy, low quality effects unit. I replaced this with an older model Yamaha EMX 2000 powered mixer, to my great satisfaction."
4,a 1st step on a great journey,"For all those beginning this quest, this book is a great place to start. It summarizes well all the salient points in a succinct little package. If you're still feeling adventurous after this book, I recommend The Education Of Oversoul Seven by Jane Roberts."
1,Kids killing each other...disturbing!!!,"I can't think of a horror movie I find more disturbing. It's incomprehensible that something like THIS is rated PG 13, but a naked body in a movie is a huge drama.I kept hoping the kids would find a way to take the excitement out of the slaughter and end the senseless yearly massacres for good, but they didn't. They just kept killing each other."
3,Price increase..cheaper at local stores,My son (who is 8 months old now) has been on this formula since he was 3 months old! He had acid reflux. We found this product on Amazon and immediately signed up for Amazon prime to have this delivered straight to our door with 2 day shipping. However the price has gone from $53.94 for 6 bottles to $60! It is no longer cheaper to purchase here on Amazon. It now equals about $10 a bottle and we can get it at our local large chain grocery store for around $9/bottle plus we can use coupons that Similac sends us! Very disappointed..we loved the ease of ordering through Amazon while also saving money. Sad day for my family when Amazon lets us down!!
4,Guy's Reviews,"This is a very good starting point for anyone interested in the aquarium hobby. It has information on setting up both marine and fresh water aquariums, plus a section at the back of the book that gives an overview on the different families of fish, both fresh water, marine and brackish water fish. It is a very good for beginners however the main downside to this book is that it is lacking information about water chemistry. This book is not to be overlooked however if you are going to buy it you are best not to stop at buying ""only"" this particular book before setting up your aquarium."
5,Don't be discouraged by the length,"When I started reading this book, mostly because I wanted to have read the book before I saw the miniseries that my dad had bought on DVD, I was a bit discouraged by the size of the book. The edition I had, which had photos from the 1984 movie on the back, was over 600 pages, which seemed pretty darn long. However, I devoured the book in three days--and then, what do you know, I read it all over again. Then I read the sequels, and watched all the movies, and read the prequels, and in short became a huge fan.Don't be discouraged by the length. You'll quickly forget that you're reading a book to rival Harry Potter once you start reading. The characters are complex and the envisioned world is mind-boggling. Don't watch any of the movies first, because they kind of ruin it. Between the adaptions, I liked the miniseries more because the architecture was less depressing.Lord of the Rings? Practically pulp fiction compared to this!"
2,not for beginners,"This is not a book for beginners. Not for beginning programmers, and not for advanced programmers who don't know much about XSLT. An introductory chapter or two explaining XSLT, and maybe a few really simple examples (10-20 lines each), would have gone a long way towards making this book more useful. If you already know XSLT pretty well, though, this could provide some useful sample code."
3,Quality sound but then there's that CD changer...,"I bought this unit for my ""smokers lounge"" about 14 months ago. I have a heated garage where I puff on the occaisional cigar, sip some eau-de-vie and listen to my music. For quite some time I was extremely pleased with this little unit. It held its own.About 9 months ago the 5 disc CD changer started skipping...not much at first and only on discs 4 and 5. Slowly things got worse until it became unuseable. I plugged an old Teac single disc player into the Auxilary input and it works fine. I did not want to hassle with a return or the dreaded warranty work.I agree with some of the other reviewers: the remote is anything but intuitive (but it works...in most cases, well) and the tape player will eat your tapes if you are not gentle and let the autoload feature take it from you.Bottom line: It sounds great, it has many nice features, it has very good speakers but the CD player (at least in mine) is junk."
2,Not a Helmet Camera Kit!,This is simply a security camera. It has no mic or battery pack! Useless as a helmet type camera setup.
5,Flight catering in the world,"Easy reading, understandable and up to date with international regulamentations and data. An excellent book for students and professionals as also for airline companies owners."
2,Pretty choppy and weak,"There are a few interesting Biblically-based thoughts in this book, but the format and syntax can be summed up in two words: wretched poetry. The free-form is atrocious and choppy, and the organization is servicable. I've read serious books that discuss the life of Jesus and Christian faith, and I've read solid free-form poetry. This is pathetic in comparison. I can't help but wonder why something of such low caliber would even be published.It may be somewhat suitable for the junior high youth group crowd, but it is far from a sounding board for deep, mature, articulated discussion. Whatever you are looking for, be it an acocunt of the life of Jesus, apologetic discussion, or info on Christian faith, much better can surely be found elsewhere. Skip it."
4,Coolaroo Large Pet Bed,"Overall the bed is great, it is pretty easy to assemble/disassemble with 4 screws. However, the reason I give it 4 stars is because of 2 reasons: 1) my dog (a 6 month Labrador puppy) was able to get at the edge of the material and chew a corner apart although the bed is still able to hold her weight and still works and 2) the frame may bend a bit and warp a bit at the point where the screws go in because the material is so tight the bed sort of twists until weight is put on it to level the bed down on all 4 legs. We brought our bed with us camping, and I sprayed the bed down with a hose to clean it and it dried in the sun within minutes. Overall I recommend this bed, as my problems may have been just with my bed and my dog."
5,Keep up the good work...I love Amazon,"Very interesting reading. It tells of many current finds that show, to anyone openminded, that many stories in the Bible are also verifable by know historical writings and acheological fines."
4,Not half bad...,"I really enjoyed the dry wit and realistic conversations that this writer delivers. Finding a writer who can write the way people really talk was fun, especially when the ""people"" are werewolves, vampires, shapeshifters, etc."
4,"Authentic, yet accessible.","I bought this book while I was in Nepal, knowing that I would miss the food when I come back to the States. It seems that the recipes are for the most part pretty authentic, similar to dished that I had in Nepal (momo's, various dal dishes, various veggie curries, roti). The ingredients are usually available in Indian grocery stores here, andif an ingredient is hard to find, the book provides alternatives.Like other reviewers have noted, this book doesn't have pretty pictures or beautiful cover. So, if you are looking for eye-candy, I don't recommend it. But if you are looking for good, accessible recipes on a rarely-written-about-in-the-English-language cuisine, I recommend this little cookbook!"
4,"Pleasing, readable fantasy, but lacking real punch","I am a huge fan of Catherine Asaro, but this book is a little bit too fluffy for me. It has the same theme as the Skolian Empire series - the ""good"" empaths vs. the ""evil"" anti-empaths who need to dominate, but the evil-doers, King Varquelle and Anvil the Forged, have been softened and weakened to the point of lacking any punch. Asaro seems to be afraid of genuine confrontation and adversity in this novel - very different from her powerful Skolian series. Iris, who takes away Chime's throne with her superior abilities, becomes her best friend. The deaf and mute king immediately loves Iris. Muller, the bumbling prince, is a refreshing character, who stumbles until almost the very end - but even here there is not enough tension. Overall a pleasant, light read, but I hope that Catherine Asaro sticks with the futuristic Cyborg novels that are her forte."
1,Doesn't work,"Put simply, this toy doesn't work. Or I should say perhaps it would work with really good bubble solution but it does not work with the bubble solution that comes with it. It sort of sputtered some bubble solution out the top but we never got even one full bubble much less the stream of bubbles we were hoping for. Luckily my little son never saw the toy and therefore didn't mind when we took it back."
2,Too much secondary characterization;,"The hero Cougar a half breed scout and heroine Libbie, a spirited spoilheiress interacted very well together. When they interacted.I kept on reading the interplaying of secondary characters Phillip and Ndolkah more so than Cougar and Libbie. I was confuse as to who were the main characters in this romance. Phillip. or Cougar, Ndolkah, or Libbie. I thought Georgina Gentry spend too much time describing the interaction between Phillip and Ndolkah and not enough of Cougar and Libbie. When I read the abuse kicking scene that Cougar received from secondary character Phillip. I wanted to throw the book across the room. This was my first Georgina Gentry romance. This will be my last."
4,Will need some experience first - great otherwise.,"I've completed an introductory yoga course at a gym and so thought I'd give this one a go. I'm reasonably fit and was looking for something that would test me. I got that! This is reasonably fast paced and I think you need to know some basic yoga moves by name to be able to keep up. If you are comfortable with that, you'll really enjoy it. I can't get through the whole work out in one go, yet, but I wasn't looking for something that I'd be able to keep up with first go and get bored with. If you are at a novice or an intermediate level, you'll find yourself coming back to this one for a challange."
4,A great keyboard but the flaps on the back break off easily,We have purchased three of these to day ~ we just love the keyboard! The only thing which we would like to see changed is the little plastic pieces on the back which lift the keyboard up at an angle. You have to be really careful with them because they break off easily. The keyboard still works well ~ it just takes away the option to have your keyboard at an angle. It works just fine laying completely flat on the desk though. Even with that little issue ... we would still purchase another one.
1,Nickelback...a total disgrace to Canada,"Don't buy this or any other CD by Nickelback. They are a horrible band with horrible songs, horrible 'music', and trite lyrics. You'd be better off dousing your head in acid then listening to this (Nickel)(...)."
5,The Latin sensation of the moment,"This is a well prepared and elaborated album, time paid off and it looks like it did for Ricky, this album has multiple mixes of latin rythms, pop music and disco that makes the album one of the best choices of the moment, no wonder he sweep the Grammys, Billboard Music Awards (latin and american), MTV video music awards (and music awards), and several in Europe. Good Job Ricky"
1,Not worth the wait,"I just recently bought the video and was eager to try it based on the other reviews that people had left. When I got it, I popped it into the VCR to watch and I have never seen a more poorly made video. It looks as though someone grabbed a camcorder from their closet and decided to make a workout tape. I was very dissatisfied with it and found that all it was basically good for was a laugh as the exercises were not very effective. I wouldn't recommend this video to anyone, and definately not for the price that I paid for it."
5,Richard Sharpe.,"Although Sharpe is like an early day six million dollar man with more lead in his body than is in an armament this is a don't miss series. We originally watched each episode on BBC America and would recommend the entire series so much so that we bought the dvd's and have watched each episode over and will do so again. There are some truly memorable individuals, but the one that stands out for me is the grizzly old sargeant that is played to perfection in the early episodes by Pete Postlethwaite. I would highly recommend this series to anyone with an interest in early military battles and also to anyone who just enjoys some good drama. Hats off to British Television once again for a first class series."
5,AWSOME FULL OUT 3D GAME.,"This game is great. I recommend it to anyone who likes to play anykind of game. I didn't even know who Spider man was intill i played a demo of the game, then i knew i had to have it. THe game has an Awsome full out 3d inviroment, and you can go through all of it. At some times you are fighting and at atother times you are just webslinging through New York City. I bought the game the first day it came out. And I didn't even know SpiderMan was a comic character intill someone told me. THE GAME RULES get it. It is the best game I have played for my playstation."
4,Chicken soup for the single parent's soul,This is a great book. It help to know that there are other people like me that have the same struggles and get through them.
2,I this really the Stones?,This is a very cheezy cd of the stones. I just saw imatators last night that did a better job!
3,Confusing characterization?,"I enjoyed the humor in the story, shown mostly through offhand remarks made by Simon Martin's long-suffering teacher. Simon and his classmates are the students everyone has given up for lost. The principal decides they aren't to be trusted with the materials found in the science lab, and assigns them the ""safe"" science fair project of taking care of a five pound flour baby for three weeks. While this sets the book up to either be hilarious or insightful, it never really pulls of either. There is so little background given on Simon Martin that his miraculous conversion from the local punk into a caring, fatherly person, seems contrived. Definitely the most realistic person in the story is Simon's teacher, who combines cutting sarcasm with a genuine (usually concealed) concern for his students. The story is almost rescued in the end, so it is worth it to keep reading!"
2,be careful,"I have used Dell, Gateway, Logitech and other keyboards. This is the only one that DOESN'T WORK until Windows come up. So basically, if you need to select your OS or do work on the BIOS that requires keyboard info, it won't work. Keyboard failure shows up during boot.I'm running it through an internal USB card on a Dell server because the internal ones on the Dell don't respond although being powered up and showing as operational in Windows. I also tried using one of those usb to ps/2 connectors that Logitech thoughtfully includes with their keyboards and mice, still didn't work.So I have to keep an old, beat-up Gateway keyboard around in case I have to do maintenance on the system."
4,"Good, quick read","I have read some of Berg's other novels, and this was not her best. However, this was an interesting look at a woman's struggle to rebuild her life. The ending is no big surprise, as our a lot of the events in the story, but it holds your interest and I am glad that I have read it."
5,"Why don't you own this already, silly?","The music itself is incredible. Its got a kind of jazzy-folkish feel that can't really be pinned down to one genre. A lot of 3/4 time as well, which you don't see as much in pop music. And yes, a trumpet. They're all very talented musicians. Plus, Alex Kapranos' intelligent sense of humour, and intelligence in general, really shine through in the lyrics, especially in songs like ""Divorce at High Noon"", ""To His Coy Dietress"", ""Life in a Barret Garret"", ""Garavurghty Butes"", etc, etc. ""The Infinite Duration"" also has some killer subtlety going on. Really really awesome stuff. You'll love it. Trust me. (..even if its nothing at all like Franz Ferdinand)"
5,nice iron,I really like this iron as it is easy to use. The iron has good weight to it and my wife loves the constant steam and the shot of steam feature. It is easy to fill with water too.
3,"Pretty good if you like ""Jeopardy!""","Let me start off by saying that no game show computer game can be spectacular or addictive. It just can't be realistic enough.But Jeopardy is about as good as a game show computer game can get. The questions are realistic (I think that they are actual show questions) and the opponents are tough enought to beat you more than half the time, if you want to set the difficulty high enough. That is my favorite feature of the game -- it is not too easy to win every time.Another feature that I like is that you can set the spelling strictness to the level that you like. It is rare that you get a question wrong because you misspelled the word. That is a nice feature.I haven't played the game enough to see the categories repeat themselves. That is a problem with every computer game of this type, and there is basically no way around that.I give this game a three, which is about the highest rating that I would give a game show game."
4,2/3 of it is a classic.,"Edith Grove's self-titled album opens with three very strong cuts and ends with another three good ones. The three in the middle, however, well--they're just filler.For Gene Loves Jezebel fans this is a must-have. At times some of the songs seem as they were lifted from a late 80's GLJ recording session---especially ""Under Your Spell"" and River's Edge."" At other times, songs such as ""Steel Away"" veer pleasantly close to early 70's ""glam."" In fact, ""Wheel"" features a chorus that bears close melodic resemblance to David Bowie/Mott the Hoople's ""All the Young Dudes."" One of the ""filler"" cuts, the tedious ""Cat Black Wizard's Hat,"" makes obvious references to the late T. Rex frontman, Marc Bolan.The album closes with an odd folksy/jangly/sing along number that would seem right at home with Dylan's ""Basement Tapes.""Overall, this is a rather decent musical adventure. Personally, I have my CD programmed to play only tracks 1-3,7, and 8 so this is more like an EP to me."
2,Save your money!,"I bought this book before going to Belize. Although it contains some beneficial information it seems very dated. What most disappointed me though, was the photos. They are poorly done and many of them have nothing to do with fishing. There are pictures of flowers, hummingbirds, statues, etc. I bought a fishing book, not a sightseeing, flora and fauna book."
1,Data loss,After two months of use I noticed severe data loss.. pictures from my vacation became unreadable. I thought it was just a one-off but so I formatted the card (in my camera) and used it again. Low and behold.. same thing. Some pictures became unreadable and lost again.Wouldn't go with Transcend ever again.. I'm going with Kingston.
1,Destruction of a classic,"I wanted a pure, unedited, un changed, re release of the original classics. Now, we get this, monstrosity of a release. I guess since Lucas is out of original ideas, he is just going to destroy these."
4,Solid overview on kilnforming,"I've got both this and the previous edition of Cumming's book in my collection. The author has plenty of hands-on experience and a broad knowledge of many glass techniques and processes. I wouldn't call this a hands-on, step-by-step tutorial in studio technique but it will certainly get you started."
2,Not a Great Book,I was a little surprised by the content of this book. It is really not a book I would recommend. It is about a Grandma who takes her grandkid to the beach and nothing goes right. Then it ends. I thought it could have been more meaningful.
3,dc comics?,"i can't believe that no one picked up that in the description they say dc comics instead of marvel .i live in worcester MA, and theres a notorious comic book store here,if those geeks heard that mistake whoever wrote that mistake would get blasted .whoever wrote that would have to live in exile for the rest of there life,what a dope!"
1,Eclectic Garbage,"A book full of modern sentiments but set in the 17th Century. Instead of wasting time reading someone's perceptions of an artist living in that age, it would be much more enriching to read Vasari's ""Lives of the Artists"" written in the days of Michelangelo by the architect who knew Michelangelo and other artists personally. As for romance, whatever occurs in this story can hardly be called that--especially by the standards of the 17th Century. Reading a modern writer's description of the lustful fantasies of an unrestrained teenage maid in that century is a sheer waste of time."
1,98 minutes of my life I'll never get back...,"I love cheesy horror movies. I've seen hundreds of them. Many are good, many are passable. Most at least have one redeeming feature. Not this one. This is one of the worst pieces of garbage I've ever had the misfortune to suffer through. As previous reviewers have mentioned, the ending made no sense. Unfortunately, most of the movie made no sense as well. Characters would appear and disappear for no reason; people told pointless ghost stories to pad the run time of the movie; somebody puked up weird insect things... I have been slowly trying to plow through my collection of 3,000 movies, and most of the time when they are this bad I've been turning them off. I just kept expecting more from this. The Lionsgate name usually means that at least some quality. Not this time. Stay away at all costs!!=Matt"
4,Another fine selection from the grill of Kermit & the gang,"Kermit serves up another fine selection of New Orleans-style funk-based swing. If you liked ""Live"" then this is a must have! Logan will love this one..."
2,Tarnished,"I bought the key ring for a Betty Boop fan, but when it came, I changed my mind on giving it. The metal ring itself was extremely tarnished and even though I know I had just purchased it, it looks too old and used to give as a gift. One day, maybe i'll use it myself. I give it 2 stars because Betty herself is fine, but it's purposeless and just another item in my junk drawer until i decide to use it. Not really worth the gas money and time to return it."
2,Snoozer,"Kept hoping/waiting for something to actually happen in this movie, and really, never did. If you feel like wasting some time on a boring movie, with really zero payoff at the end, this is the movie for you."
1,Is this lady for real?,"People will believe anything. This book is full of proposperous claims, and scientifically impossible devices. The idea of a 9V battery ""zapping"" parasited deep in body tissues is most ridiculase. Last time I checked, the skin was quite an insulator. The book has no hard facts to back up all the claims. Where are the many people that are cured from these cancers and even HIV/AIDS. There are none, because the only diaganosis cured were tested by some hocus pocus in the quacks private practice. No medically diagonosed cases have ever been cured by this money grubbing con aritist. The book tries to generate fear about being contaminated by everyday living. The cure, send money for off the wall products and supplements with no quality control packing. If you would by the brooklin bridge, this book is for you."
1,never got it,I was disappointed that I didn't get this book at all - in fact I still have six dollars left on a gift coupon because they took money off of my bank card for the shipping and I don't think they reimbursed that back off my credit card. I was looking forward to using that book but I can't say I was pleased with the shop that doesn't keep more timely records of their inventory
3,this is wayy to small for my toes,"i have tons of toe rings and this one is ridiculously small.. hurts to wear when stretched so i gave up.the quality, however is good."
4,Really?,Suspend disbelief and just enjoy the ride. Fun little film full of supposition. Watch the bonus material too. It's ripe with interesting stuff.
3,Good and Bad,"I purchased a pair of these shorts about 6 years ago from another retailer and wanted a second pair because I liked them so much. I was a little disappointed in the quality of the second pair. Old Glory didn't ship them well and they were of a lesser quality than the first pair. I would have bought from the same retailer, but these shorts are discontinued. Old Glory wouldn't offer a discount to me when I wrote them an email to complain about the quality."
4,Tastes very good,"If you like a thin crust pizza, these will work for you! They hold the toppings well, and taste great. I tried (and failed) many times to make my own pizza crust. This is worth the price, if you must have pizza. I froze the other pizza shells, and they always turn out great. (Just sit out & thaw for about 30 mins before adding topping & cooking.)"
1,doesnt work on xp,very let down doesnt work on xp computers it wouldnt work on my computer and my computer is only 3 years old
5,A woefully overlooked Altman masterpiece,"A woefully overlooked film, this is one of my very favorite by Altman. Amazing acting by Tim Roth and Paul Rhys, and the whole film is tremendously moving.For me, Altman achieves a sort of dream state far more interesting than in the more critically acclaimed `3 Women'. He manages to make you feel the whole story as completely real, as if you were there in history, and yet, it has a fractured, dreamlike quality, with moments left unexplained and mysterious, but always making emotional sense.I don't know any film that better captures the pain of being an artist, or the pain of being unable to save someone you love. Also, the whole film looks gloriously like a painting.There is a longer version, originally made for European TV, but I actually think the rhythms are far better in the US theatrical cut. The Euro version mostly adds tons of exposition that takes away from the mysterious, subjective tone that makes this work so well."
3,Good Product but works better on MACs than PCs,"I bought this a month ago but had trouble installing it on my Dell PC (running Windows XP.) Before I bought this, I talked to Digidesign Tech Support, and they cannot tell me for sure if the software will run on my PC. The problem seems to be that there are so many different PC's out there (using different Intel processor chips) that Digidesign has not tested ProTools on all of them. Most of my colleagues who use ProTools are using it on MAC's. So I decided to return the product and and wait until I can buy a MAC first.Also, the retailer - Electronica Direct - charged $39 for shipping (by UPS), which I thought was a little steep (I paid only $23 to ship it back by UPS with full insurance.) But they were very reasonable and courteous with processing the return."
5,Best trance cd took years to find again,I used to have this CD in 2001. walked into an independent cd store and they recommended this CD. Im tempted to spend the 30$ to get it again. When my car was stolen the thing i was pissed most about is this cd being stolen with it. Sad but thats how much of an impact this CD had on me. Its 2010 and im raving about it
3,Too romantic to be true!,"A love story for those who still believe that love can last a lifetime. Good reading for someone very romantic, but if you are a down-to-earth person, this book is definitely not for you."
2,Worked well for 7 months,"These earphones were good only for 7 months. I've owned other earphones from various manufacturers but they just don't go bad so quickly! I used it for my iPhone while I would go for a run but after about 7 months of use, the speaker on the left side of the earphone simply stopped working. Not a good product."
4,"Powerful, great cut, but loud","A very powerful clipper that will cut my thick hair in one quick stroke. To my pleasant surprise it also came with blades and other accessories even though that wasn't included in the product description.The tapering lever has a wide range, probably a quarter inch.My only complaint is that they are extremely loud. When I adjust the power down to reduce the volume it's not strong enough to cut. I have to wear earplugs when I use them and the noise annoys my wife, but other than that it is an awesome product. I am fairly confident that this problem can be resolved through tinkering with the screws.Include blades, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, left taper, right taper. Also came with oil, brush, and blade guard."
5,Great cookbook,"This cookbook is easy to follow and has great suggestions for meals broken down into several categories. The categories include meat, poultry, fish and seafood, veggies, cookies etc. There is at least 150 recipes in this cookbook. It is a really old but for people who are starting out, its a must buy."
2,We've Heard It All Before,"Yawnnnnn.....Nothing new here.... Selected stuff... We've heard it all before and if you are a fan, you probably have most of this. Forget the Live disc (#4) too. Get Hell Freezes Over and/or Hotel California and the first Greatest Hits....Henley and Frey must want some easy Christmas money with a few pennies going to Leadon, Felder, Schmidt, Walsh and Meisner. Variations of the notes in the booklet have shown up in print before - ARGH. These guys had a hard time working together because each was a 'genious' and a 'perfectionist'. I guess that's why there are no alternative takes. Come on guys.... Too bad..."
1,attack force should be shot down!,"I am a major segal fan but I can honestly say this was a total waste of film. segal has a voice over for more than half of his limited dialogue, the story is absolutely ludicrous and the special effects are awful. the only thing I can think of he is just needed the money or something. I threw the movie away. It is one of THE WORST movies I have ever seen!!!!"
4,Rubbermaid Pants Hanger,Takes up less space & keeps my slacks nice and neat! Does take a little extra time to hang them.
5,The way live should be,I read the other review and totally disagree this cd is great and a must have. The stenght of his voice is fantasic. The rendition of the songs are different than the 45s but if you want to hear the songs that way there are other great albums. This is live baby with heart and soul!
4,Auxilary Wide-Angle Side-View Mirror (Medium),"The mirrors worked better for me mounted on the bottom of the side mirrors, especially when I had them first installed on top and went through the car wash. The right mounted one fell off, but luckily I retrieved it from an eagle-eyed attendant and he put it back on for me on the bottom. So far, so good. As for viewing the road in the blind spots, once you find the exact angle when installing, they work very well. Neck surgery necessitated me having them and for that reason, they're worth recommending to anyone needing them for this."
3,Not exactly what I had hoped,"Being the cough and cold season, I wanted/needed some chrysanthemum tea - a drink that I learned to love while in Penang, Malaysia. The dried flower tisane, available from my local Chinese herbalist, helped to soothe coughing quite effectively but it is a little pricey.Seeing this listing on Amazon for ""finest quality"" quality tea at a reasonable price, I ordered a can for home and at work. The listed product is (apparently) a dark, well-fermented tea that is slightly flavored with a few chrysanthemum blossoms. It has a not particularly great flavor, and is not the product that I was seeking."
1,boring,"Kittle's playing is uninspiring. I found no character. His constant use of white notes and ""wailing"" attempting to give something of musicality is a turnoff. Besides he might consider obtaining a better instrument. His sound is quite mediocre and if he calls this playing jazz, I am on another planet."
1,Not Worth It,"I bought mine at Wal-Mart for $20, followed the instructions with two scratched DVD's from the library (one badly scratched, the other still playable) - and saw almost no change in the scratches or playability. It's going back in the morning.This model relies on an aluminum oxide paste (superfine liquid sandpaper) to sand off the scratches. I think I'll see better performance from one of the products that actually fills in the scratches rather than sanding down the rest of the disc.For cleaning, just get one of the inexpensive manual cleaners with the little bottle of denatured alcohol - they work just fine."
2,Missing the mark,"Black and decker really blew this one. This is a crude sloppy piece of work. It does not really do anything well but tries to do 2 or 3 things badly or sloppily. There is a much better strictly mechanical wrench sold at home depot that has all of the supposed virtues of this wrench but is of quality workmanship for the same or less money.See Crescent AC8NKWMP 8"" Rapid Slide Adjustable WrenchThe above review applies to an older model currently in stores which is improved but not enough. Grit & stuff in the work place clogs up the switch and the mechanism so that you have have compressed air to blow it out and keep it working."
2,Disappointing,"I am a diehard Raymond Feist fan, have read everything he's written, so I think I have the perspective to say this is NOT his best stuff. I really felt he phoned this one in. The man who brought us Pantathian Serpent priests is now resorting to vampires as villans?! How pedestrian! This work was far less imaginative than any of his previous books. I really began to wonder if perhaps Mr. Feist has run out of gas with regard to storylines for the world of Midkemia (I hope not!). With the success of his video games perhaps his focus is less on writing these days and more on other creative pursuits. This book did have the feel of a video game. Every couple of pages the 'good guys' did battle with 'bad guys' and after awhile it got quite tiresome. Where the political intrigue and finely drawn characters that make his earlier work so engrossing? Mr. Feist is a master of creating believable worlds but he just took us to a very boring corner of this one."
3,A nice Sunday drive,"If you are looking for a a good book that compliments the first ""Rig Warrior"" book this is not it. I absolutly enjoyed the first book, but this one needs to bee rethought out. I felt Barry ""Dog"" Rivers could have gotten a little deeper into the situation that was going on in the town this story was set in. It was interesting to find out what he went through after the ending of the first book, but again I didn't feel his presence here as in the first installment. Hopefully the third book will be an exciting conclusion to this series. If you have read the first book and are planning on reading the third go ahead a check this one out. I'm sure some of the informatin that we are given here will come to play in the third."
5,"Great product, great price","Honestly...my review is very similar to what others are saying. These bottles are easy to hold and easy to clean because it does break down into pieces. I think that the price is great for what the product is, and I like the color variety. I agree that the bottles do not leak as long as you screw them together correctly. As for how much the bottles hold true to their claim? Not sure! First baby! So my reference of more or less is undetermined! So far so good though!"
2,I wouldn't highly recommend this one.,"The video was o.k., but I expected it to be more dramatic, as showing what a person has to go through while being arrested and the process of being fingerprinted, locked in a cell with other criminals, etc. this was a play and a short one."
2,Not the best choice,"I needed a colander and like the cherry design. Unfortunately, there aren't really enough holes to allow for quick draining. I'm keeping it but if I knew before I ordered it that it wouldn't drain quickly, I would not have ordered it."
4,Good book,"This book is about the life of a few cadets in a year at the USMA. The author does a good job in describing the routine and schedules of the cadets, providing good details of specific events. The biggest problem with this book is that it lacks the reality of cadet life. The author, while showing a few tough moments, doesn't represent the actual feelings of the cadets. All the cadets are too happy all the time. They are never shown being normal college students making mistakes, and being frustrated with their surroundings. This book comes off as an official publication for West Point, but is still a good read."
4,"Self absorbed, but good info too","Maybe it isn't fair of me to say this, but it seemed pretty clear to me, while reading this book, that its author was a fairly self-absorbed person before her illness, and remained so during and after. It was hard for me to read, at times, because of this.However, there is some extremely valuable information here, especially in the book's constant reminders that many who cannot communicate in the usual ways are fully aware and have feelings, often strong ones. Some sensitivity is in order in any such situation, and I expect to retain that lesson for years to come.There is also some good information about Guillain-Barre, which I did not know anything at all about prior to reading the book."
2,didn't like too hard to hold baby in it,i am a new mom so maybe that is the reason I don't like the tub. it is too high of an angle to wash a newborn. it is too hard to hold the baby with one hand and wash with the other. maybe when she gets older and has head control it will be better
3,OK for price,"The games are decent, durability is good. My daughter bored of it rather quickly. Can't turn volume off."
1,Refund Received,"This software did not work properly, and technical assistance was not available. However, the seller did eventually refund the purchase price."
2,"Listened to it for weeks, and still bad.","Well, I've listened to the CD for a couple of weeks, now, and most of it is still unbearable. The only saving grace now (besides a mediocre ""Falling Down"") that has come with multiple daily listening is the three song group of ""Beside You"", ""Liquid Sky"" and ""Breakdown"", and of those, ""Beside You"" is truly the only memorable one. After those three songs, I just hit rewind, and play those three songs over again. ""When the Rain Comes"" and ""How Could I?"", and the last three songs might as well not even be on the CD, because they're unremarkable and truly forgettable.Where's Chris DeGarmo's new band? All of a sudden, ""All I Want"" from HITNF doesn't seem so bad."
3,Lighten up People,"I find the adulation of Rand's supporters almost as amusing as the hysteria of her detractors. Read the reviews here and notice all of the petty shots taken. Yes folks there are many intelligent and educated people who, agree with Rand, but people who do not are not budding fascists (the true Philosophy Rand is opposing in this book.)Rand's essential points, that reason is a better guide to public policy than emotion, that it's wrong to take from others by force or the threat of force, that religion has no place in public policy, are all fine. It is Rand's contention of non-contradiction, that creates the problem in this novel, I would expound on that further, but it is not My intention to debate Philosophy here.As for Rand's literary style, keep in mind that Russian writers tend to focus more on ideas than character.So over all I would recommend this book, not as a manual for life, but far better than it's hysterical critics would have you believe."
4,best war movie,the kind of fun and comedy that you never expect in a war setting great job no cussing and still gets the job done
3,Bible Commentary,I found the book useful but biased with a certain social agenda promoting popular earthly interpretations rather than biblical exegesis.
2,not terrible,"I had just finished 'Angry Housewives Eating Bon-Bons', another 'reading club' novel, and enjoyed it very much. I saw this in the store and it looked similar so I decided to read it. To be kind, it was not nearly as good. I did finish it, and it did get better as I continued, but I could have easily misplaced the book and not missed not being able to finish it."
5,Halperin Weaves a Believable Future...,"James Halperin has once again hit the nail on the head. I picked up ""The Truth Machine"" as an impulse buy a while back... when I saw ""The First Immortal"" in the bookstore, I grabbed it immediately. If Mr. Halperin's suppositions about the future are even halfway correct, and I've seen none that ""felt"" more accurate, I'll definitely be signing up for some cryonic suspension of my own. My advice: BUY THIS BOOK. And start saving your pennies for your own suspension."
1,Pining for the Garwood of Yore,"This book is a stinker. When I compare the artistry, humor, and emotion of Garwood's historicals with this...book...I want to WEEP! Once upon a time, she was my favorite! I re-read her work over and over again. This book, however, has no mystery, no charm, no character development--I could go on, but other reviewers have said it for me. And it's not that I don't like contemporary romantic suspense--they're my favorites!--but Garwood just can't write them. Try a Linda Howard. Try a Catherine Coulter. Try a JD Robb. But leave these new Garwoods on the shelf where they belong. Serious readers should discount all those positive reviews. They could only have been written by Garwood's kids."
1,Waste of money,"After reading some of the reviews I had pretty high hopes that I'd like this movie. Maybe I missed something, but I didn't feel like there was much of a point to the movie. Like another reviewer said, the female actors in the movie are all very attractive; however, every male in the film is scrawny, pale, with a less than attractive face. It made the sex scenes awkward and gross for some reason. If you watch the movie, be prepared to see quite a few penises too. I think the director was definitley going for the shock factor but I just found the movie to be repulsive and boring. Sadly, I feel I wasted my money and time on this movie."
5,"A wonderful surprise, thought-provoking and well acted","Donnie Darko was a movie that I had wanted to see, but hadn't gone out of my way to do so. It was on late one night, and it certainly kept me up. This is one of those movies that, if you get it, will probably be one of your favorites, but if you don't get it, you won't like. It certainly is not frivolous and you have to watch the movie and pay attention, and probably will require multiple viewings to really see everything. That's ok because it's a wonderful movie, despite its dark overtones. The acting is top-rate from everyone and it was well cast and directed. If you like movies and aren't afraid to be challenged a bit, this comes very highly recommended."
1,Embarrassing,I'm embarrassed that I enjoyed this when it was first released. This is painful to watch. The sight of Robert Plant twirling his finger up by his head is indelibly etched in my brain and has turned me from a Zep fanatic to Zep detractor. Only redeeming quality of the video is Bonham's playing
4,Great for younger kids too,"My Mom insisted on buying this for my 1 year old twins even though it suggests that it is suitable for 3 years and up. Well, they love it. They hammer on it, stand on it and pull it over. It is very robust. It is sufficiently in tune to play your favorite songs and comes with a handy little song book (probably more use to a 3 year old than my 1 year olds)."
3,Not really dried strawberries,When I ordered these I thought they would be freeze dried strawberries that I could use in cereal or for snacking. But they are somewhat dehydrated strawberries that have been super sweetened. I will use them for baking instead. Just be aware that they are not plain dried strawberries.
5,I love Bette Midler,"I am so glad that I purchased this CD. Great value, quick ship and brought back tons of memories!"
3,Just an Introduction,"The book is very much an introduction, but not as good as those ""blank for dummies books."" It reads as if you entered the front door, then a second later, turn around and are back in the hall way. The chapters are short and simple. The actual philosophical and theological concepts are reduced to sentences. If anyone were to read this book believing it's the movement's intellectual history, they would be disappointed.Perhaps the greatest contribution towards reconstruction's theory is Judaism as a Civilization by Kaplan, a good primary source that shows the movement through the founder's eyes.I would recommend it for someone who wants a quick introduction without the difficulty of theological perspectives."
5,Got Anthology?,I actually purchased all of the anthology and it was outstanding! just relive those historic moments meant soo much to me a must buy for all true wrestling fans!
5,Piece of mind,"Easy to install, look great, no rust after 3 months. great price 2 day delivery. Key is heavy duty, best price I could find"
3,Good Value,"I purchased this fold down kennel as a general use crate to temporarily house various animals when needed. It's made of light weight materials, but still a pretty good value for the money. It works well for my needs, but I would not recommend it for heavy or continued use."
1,Brutal Film,Brutal filmI just returned from watching this film and the only words that come to mind are:GraphicRealisticBrutalExtremeIf you are looking for a film for the shock value only this makes Cannibal Holocaust or Day of the Dead look like a walk in the park.The feel of the film is a direct copy of Gladiator both cinematically and musically. The violence begins almost from the beginning and doesn't end until the credits roll. I should add excessive graphic violence. ...
1,No suction!!!,"I put this item back in the box to return it just 5 minutes after i took it out. The chamber where you put the cleaning liquid leaked, and when i went to use it on my couch (since it says it's appropriate for upholstery) it sprayed and then never sucked up the liquid so my couch basically just got soaked with cleaning liquid and no dirt was ever suctioned by the cleaner. It worked a little better on a section of carpet but over all this product did not deliver what it said. I would advise to spend a little more money and get a better product."
2,lead is wrong,"Solid cast, with the exception of the lead. Rooker from the first one should have been back, as well as the original director and writer: John McNaughton and Richard Fire, respectively.This director here doesn't seem to get suspense--and it hurt the film. There is just no beating the original. Too bad McNaughton and the rest from the first flick did not come back for an encore--because now, even if they did, it might be way too late.It's kind of sad, because McNaughton might have had a far bigger/impressive film career if he had.Skip this one. See the original (20 year anni issue, etc.). It will give you chills."
1,Junk.,The unit broke the 3rd time I used it. The 3 times it did work it just was not power full or easy to use. The button is hard to push and the cord is to short... You can do much better then this thing.
4,Krieger Straight Razor,"I bought this razor with some trepidation having read so many negative razor reviews generally and knowing it was very reasonably priced. I ordered it anyway and I love it. It needed sharpening of course, knives, etc. generally do when new. But it is sturdy, well made and attractive. It is a bit on the heavy built side, kind of a macho appeal I guess, not to extreme though. It took and is holding a very good edge. It is working better and giving me smoother shaves than my antique (truly, handed down) high carbon steel straight razor. I would recommend it to anyone, especially at the price. That is my experience. I've had it for about three of four weeks."
1,Terrible poetry,"This collection of poems was a real disappointment! I was expecting good poetry and a great deal of humour from Kim's book, unfortunately, it consisted of a collection of very poorly written poems that were predictable and contained a hidden religious message. The poems appear to be based on the experiences of a man who has never had a girlfriend or had much contact with girls in general.Metaphors were used inappropriately and the standard of English was disappointing low.I afraid this one gets the thumbs down from me!"
1,Pop at commercial!,"Heavy metal to disco to hair metal! Thats commerical! Commerical, means not music with expressions but music that people that buy what ever they hear on a pop radio. Meanless pop may live but to be mock by better music!"
2,"Say what, you guys?","Who's writing all the reviews of this album? I have a feeling at least a couple of them are written by the band. That's the only way to explain it. This album is not good. Are you kidding me? Why listen to this when there is SO MUCH music out there that blows this out of the water? Listen, for what you have to pay for this mediocre CD, you can go out there and get two Megadeth or Judas Priest or Motorhead CDs. So just do that. Pass this one by. You won't miss it."
3,"An enjoyable read, but over-rated.","I've been hearing rave reviews about Enders Game for years. I read it last weekend and I did enjoy it, however, I do think some people adorned this story with too much praise. I'm not saying it was bad, it's just not the Sci-Fi genius I've been hearing (nor does it deserve a ""5 star"" rating). It kept me interested throughout, but I predicted the ending two chapters prior.For a decent Sci-Fi story, Ender's Game will do. If you desire more depth, read ""Battlefield Earth""."
4,Enjoyable Kindle mystery novel set in Key West.,"Before going to Key West last week,I had asked at the Amazon Kindle forum for suggestions for books set in Key West. I received a number of recommendations, including Corcoran's series which is set right there. This was the best book in those suggestions.Alex Rutledge is a part-time crime photographer who, at the beginning of this novel is mugged and propositioned (for a job). All of this launches a mystery with several murders, and a story that goes back 20+ years.This was a VERY enjoyable novel(my first by him) with a story that moved along, and several very enjoyable characters who I look forward to following again (There are more books in this series). The mystery isn't that great, but rather an entertaining read well worth following.There are some formatting/typos in the Kindle edition. (""Mamie"" becomes ""Marnie"", ""Corner"" becomes ""comer"" are frequent examples.) Not enough to disrupt the story flow, but they should have been corrected."
1,Scary sounds and unstable,"As everyone has already said, this toy is extremely unstable. My 10 month old son loves to pick toys up by the legs and since it is so top heavy it comes crashing down violently. Most annoyingly though is the sounds to the toy. First off, there is no volume control, and it is loud. Second, the ""cat"" and the ""monkey"" sound actually scared my child and made him cry. Third, it is just a hectic crazy console. You can't predict which ""game"" it is going to ask you to play and the piano keys don't play piano sounds. Babies like cause and effect, but this doesn't teach them anything because each button doesn't have a specific effect, it just sets off another series of loud annoying sounds. I expected more from Vtech, especially for an older baby. I am so disappointed. Luckily I can return it."
1,irresponsible.,"I used to read Shapiro's columns in the Daily Bruin, and this book follows the same pattern-- sneering, arrogant writing that doesn't really bother with ""facts."" It's all very well that he's got lots of footnotes-- if only they were accurate! He's obviously smart enough to know the difference between reporting facts and quotes and distorting/falsifying them-- and perhaps if his argument were stronger, he wouldn't have to resort to such exaggeration and distortion."
1,Substandard,I agree with the previous two reviews. The screw was not even parallel with the threaded nut. I had to insert several washers under one side when mounting it. I thought I could save a few bucks by using the Shop Fox. Do yourself a favor-spend a little bit more money and buy a decent one.
4,Good but buy the Blu-ray,"I love this movie so my 4 stars are because the regular DVD does not have the extras that apparently the Blu-ray does. I wanted to see the deleted scenes- some of which are alluded to in the trailer, but they are not on this version. Still great movie."
3,Monitors depend on the house,"Look monitors are a tricky business...I used to live in an apartment where this monitor was great...no problems. We moved and I began to get static and lots of problems. So I took the monitor back (used and they took it)...and bought me a Sony, that was a great machine it worked perfectly, until I tried it in my mother's house then it was a piece of crap. The associate at Babies R Us told me that baby monitors depend on the house and it is a trial and error thing...the only thing she recomended was more that 900mhz and more than one channel (I agree with her...thanks to babies r us and their employees)"
1,junk chinese knockoff,"Light weight, warps blade when screw is tightened, used (tried to use) for 2 hours, threw in trash. ONLY BUY THE REAL THING."
2,Give Him Songs That Fit His Style,"The 2 stars are for the albums songs, not Elliott's voice. He was my AI favorite that season, because of his unique style. Loved the blue-eyed soul!These song styles are NOT what he does best. The album producers should have, and need to, let him go-with-the-soul instead of trying to fit him into another mold.I'm looking forward to a truly ""soul-focused"" album from Elliott."
1,not good,It does not converts european stuff to USA voltage standarts. Also you need to combine plug conveters to use it.
3,"Fine as a first time lightweight review of a PMBOK chapter, but not at all close to the real PMP exam questions","I found the questions in this book to be way easier than questions from other study books and preparation tests, and quite far from the situational questions that you get on the real PMP exam.I would say that as a very lightweight first time review (through a set of questions) for a particular chapter of the PMBOK, this books is fine, but is far from what you'll get in reality on the PMP exam. I used it like that and got almost all the questions right. Just make sure you don't get fooled by that and that you are ready for the exam if you get that.I found quite detrimental that the questions were organized by chapters and not mixed up as a single 200 question set as you get them on the exam. I guess the purpose of the book is not to be a PMP exam test example, just a bunch of Q&As;, so just be aware of this."
2,not recommended,"After researching for months to find a way to take notes easily and quickly and still be able to read them afterwards, I tried EasyScript.In fact, it IS easy to learn to WRITE. However, it does take discipline and practice to be able to read your notes after a while. There is just too much ambiguity in the abbreviations and compound words. So, while you can be fast in writing, reading of your own notes can be a challenge.I gave up after a few weeks of trying."
2,too long,"The pants are too long. The pants bottoms are practically open in spite of the elastic closure which are way too loose,so the pants being too long get caught under the shoes"
1,Did not finish,This was one of the very few books that I couldn't bring myself to finish. The heroine just grated on my nerves too much.
1,Night Games,This book has to be the worst thing I have ever read. I stopped after about 100 pages but started reading again....hoping it would get better as it went along. I suffered through to the end. Was never so glad in my life to reach the last page in a book.
4,Order went smoothly and item appears as advertised. Unused to date.,"Order went smoothly and item appears as advertised. Unused to date and serving as spare. blah, blah, ditto,blah, blah"
1,Buyer Beware,"This book is a poorly written and factually ""challenged"" libertarian diatribe, trying to pass itself off as Smart Growth. I was fooled by the misleading title and mistakenly ordered this book, which contains chapters extolling the role of the automobile in society, and containing some really intriguing ecological work describing the overpopulation of deer in suburbia as evidence of ""wildlife diversity"". This publishing company is a front supported by ""free-market"" supporting industry (read: no bothersome regulatory laws) which produce pseudo-science tracts such as this one."
4,"Suggested for Otaku, Artists, and Website Owners","At only 93 pages, this book may seem a little expensive [...]. However, i believe the Scout Guides were intended for otaku (anime fanatics), and devoted fans of the show. This book has lots of pictures, so it's great for us artists. For you website owners, it has lots of character statistics, as well as episode information. If you're looking for insight into Sailor Venus as a person, this is a nifty book, which reminds you why you love her. It even has translations of the Japanese songs, which adds alot of depth.The big thing to watch out for, however, is that you get confused by the layout. In the episode summaries, the events may seem to occur out of order, maybe even backwords. Fans who know how to read Japanese manga (right-to-left) will have an easier time with this book."
4,LL's first CD is pretty good for a first try,"I really do like this CD. I think shes got a good voice, and the lyrics are good... Something reminds me of Hilary Duff, who I don't really like. But I'll get over it, because I like LL as an actress and now a vocalist. I got this CD yesterday, so I hope to get more attached to this CD.I think that most of the songs range from 3/5-4/5. Only Symptoms of You, First, Rumors, and Anything but Me are better. The lyrics are ok, the vocals need a bit of work, but overall the CD is a 4/5."
1,Say Wha?!,"Can anyone explain the absurd prices asked? I love Lennie, but not that much. Theone star is just to enter the reviews..."
1,Luc Besson receives one star for being better than the movie,"This is one of the worst sf movies in history. Repugnant violence, because the director wants you to be thrilled so the violence is not justified. No way. And the villain doesn't get punished before the ending. And the ending is lame, because you were waiting for something else. An the acting is juvenile and amateurish. And so is the director. And there is noise in space, because the producers missed physics 101 in school."
1,Lousy fit,"The fit on this kit is ridiculous bad on my 97 Teg. I'm not sure what to think. The manual says its for 88-91 Tegs in some places and 88-01 Tegs in other places. It definitely doesn't fit well. It doesn't have a bracket to mount where the OEM radio was mounted, and it doesn't fit snugly in the double-din slot. The top and bottom guides are bowed inward, the face plate bows outward, and after a few days the whole thing slides back out of the slot about a half inch on each side and I have to push it back in.While I'm complaining, I should also add the the installation manual is absurdly brief.I guess its probably better than nothing -- but not much better. I'm going to try to find a kit from another dealer. But until I do I have no choice but to keep using this one."
5,Gershwin/Bernstein: Rhapsody In Blue and American In Paris,"In my opinion you just can't go wrong with Leonard Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. I have many of their recordings in addition to many recordings of other orchestras; some great, some not so much...but the New York Phil is cosistently great. This recording is a superb example of Gershwin's writing, thoughtfully reproduced by a fine orchestra. Both the brashness of the pieces and the subtleties are interpreted well by Mr. Bernstein and the orchestra. The soloists are nothing other than excellent. The brass section is easily as strong as the Chicago symphony's famous section, and the strings intonation is superb. The pathos and the humor of both pieces are readily projected by this sensitive orchestra and conductor. I couldn't recommend this recording higher!"
2,Way Too Noisy,"This product works as it should though it is overly loud. Using this clipper near your head requires ear plugs to stave off impending deafness. For a product in this price range, this is an unnecessary compromise and I find the clipper almost unusable. I would not recommend this product."
5,"Great toy, helps promote walking & more",This toy was a Xmas present for my grandson & it really helped him to learn to walk & so much more. He's almost 2yo & still uses the toy. And he has been really tough on this toy & it is very durable. I am very happy with this purchase & most definitely recommend to others!
5,There Were No Survivors,"""You're Dead, Cardassia is Dead."" said the Changeling. Don't skip this one. It's a great season cliffhanger, just like good Star Trek should be. It heats up the elements of all the DS9 story arcs, and leaves us wanting more. I especially like all the detail we get in 45 minutes. It's screen-worthy. 5/5 Stars. ~Keep On Trekkin'!"
4,Light weight and appropriate size of monitor,"Machine is good but the description in Amazon was not so.I was trying to know if the machine has one 512 RAM or two 256 RAMs. But I could not find any relevant info. So, I just assumed that it might have the same RAM configuration as those in the other markets (bestbuy, etc), which had one 512 RAM. I bought one planning add one 512 RAM to make the total 1G.But when I got the machine I found it had two 256 RAMs so that I took one of them out and put 1G RAM instead.Sun"
1,Useless for me!,"After the VGA port of my TV went bad, I looked for a solution to get the video from my computer to the television via VGA connection from my computer to the S-Video connection on the TV. This product promised it would do just that. After connecting it to both, I got nothin'! And I do mean nothing. I don't know if the product is just worthless, or if I missed something, because no mater what I've tried, this product DOES NOT WORK. And mailing it back would be a waste of time, as the postage would have cost more than the actual product itself. Waste of my time and money..."
3,Seen Better,"Apart from the momentary dream sequences of commentary by various well known industry animators, this book is only a duplicate of Preston Blair's book. In fact it is cheaper to buy Blair's book if you are really interested in learning about animation. This book is more notes on animation rather than a survival kit. If you can afford to have only one book, then Blair would be the better. This comes in as second place. I think Williams would have been better off writing an autobiography than doing this book."
3,Fun,"This show is fun. But don't think that you are getting much in the way of story and plot. It is about 2min dialog, 5min soft porn...2min dialog..5min soft porn. Honeestly I would have enjoyed it more if they did a little less of the sex thing.... If I wanted porn I would rent porn...."
1,slinky crystal radio,Winding the tuning coil was critical and ridiculously hard to do. Assembly of the cheap parts (toilet paper roll) and single plastic folding form was tough to get to stay fixed once assembled. Never got the radio to work although it did pick up some static.
4,Very good quality for reasonable price.,"I using this blanket every day and it completely satisfied my needs. It is warm and light weight item. But it is good only at climate like New York, where temperature not lower then 25-32F"
3,The album gets old really fast.,"Most songs on this album aren't timeless. Within weeks, you will get sick of this album. Ruben should've came better than this. There are a few tracks that stand out, they are ""What If,"" ""How Can U Mend A Broken Heart,"" ""After The Candles Burn"" and ""Superstar."" The rest are boring album fillers, or just are so terrible, that you can't listen to the whole song. ""No Ruben"" and ""What Is Sexy"" are examples of two terrible songs. Hopefully on his sophomore album, he will bring the heat like a true American Idol."
4,Fun!,This book has a fabulous ending! And just when you think the book is coming to an end... there's still more to go! Which I love. Enjoy!
1,Letter Writing,"Using the address she found on her copy of Season 1, my roommate sent Warner Brothers a letter in the U.S. Mail in which, she wrote about the number of reviews at Amazon in general, most if not all of which were asking where the second season was. She also wrote that without the rest of the series, she might as well send them her copy of the first as it is no good to her without them.I agree that Warner Brothers is being a complete idiot in this case. I realize they don't care about us as people, but I thought they cared about money. Maybe I was wrong..."
4,Good refeence guide,Good reference book for taking along on walks while looking for artifacts. Easy to use and easy to stuff in a pocket or backpack.
3,"The Best of its Type, but...","after much comparison shopping, i chose the rio volt for the following reasons:plays wma files alsodoesn't skipcomes with rechargable batteriesis reasonably easy to navigate once you learn howgives good info on its better-than-average lcd screenhas a useful remote and a nice skin casehas acceptable soundhas good controls.i was very pleased with this player for the first 2 weeks. then it just stopped working. i tried changing batteries, running off the a.c. with no luck. so i sent it back, and i'm now back to square 1. i've since read about other quick failures.i'd gladly pay top $ for a really quality, really well made mp3 cd player. sony makes a pretty one, but it doesn't have the features that this one has. (the sony also beeps when in pause mode- aaagh!)"
3,Decent,"I really wanted to like this product. I love cinnamon rolls and cinnamon babka, so I thought this would be an easy go to. The consistency is too processed and it is just a strange flavor. One is just better off combining brown sugar, cinnamon and butter on their own."
2,What the heck?Is this it?,"So i ordered this for my dads birthday and he really likes sushi. I was excited when i found this on amazon it said it came with a book,rolling mat, etc. Well i got it a few days ago and all i got was the book i was hoping for the other parts but they haven't come. i ordered it with standard shipping but i think it was supposed to come together. anyway ill talk about the book. its really short and i say doesn't have the normal recipes only a few. I would have liked to know what i was supposed to get before i bought this and what was in it"
3,literature book,"The seller was very honest about the damage of the books. The arrival of the material was awesome, thanks"
2,Oral B replacement Heads,"Purchased these items a few weeks ago. Already one head has fallen off and the second one is coming loose! These are somehow sub-standard or didn't pass quality control. They look original, but aren't up to the normal standard of replacement heads I have previously purchased."
1,Do not buy this one,This product is not worth the price. It actually is worse than my old and much lighter 100' cord. I am not sure of the size but it weighs substantially less than the Coleman - it is 20+ years old. I wanted to use this for my air compressor. While the smaller wire will run it the Coleman will not - so I spent more money for the larger wire and the extra weight to haul around and it will not do the job. Bummer. I should return it but after paying the freight and all the hassle it is not worth it. Probably will not be buying Coleman products for a while.
5,Indiana Jones,this was a great moviea movie the whole family would likeIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was my favoritealot of action
2,"Worked for 3 months, then quit.","This product worked fine with my IBM Model M keyboard for about 3 months. Occasionally, the keyboard would seems to lose its connection and reconnect within a second. I'd notice that the lock lights on the keyboard would flash off and on and I'd lose a letter or two while typing. It didn't bother me too much. I'll refer to this as restarting because I figure a short or something in the chip in the cable is causing it to restart. Last night, while playing a game, the device freaked out on me. It began continually restarting. The lock lights just kept flashing on and off and I'd get almost continual missing and/or repeated characters.I've had nothing but bad luck with Belkin products in the past, so this will be my last Belkin brand product."
1,Goes against what all other dieticians say,"Natalia Rose has an unhealthy obsession with poo, plus she thinks you can gobble down tons of avocados and coconuts (both teaming with calories and fat) and still loose weight! She also wants you to skip breakfast--one of the key things every other dietitian tells you NOT to do! This ""diet"" left me feeling light-headed and nauseous. I need real food, not juice and water. This book is for crazy people."
1,This movie sets a poor example.,"I don't mind too much if a movie is poorly-written, because writing requires talent, not just education. But this movie sets a bad and unsafe example for everyone who watches it, and especially the kids who are its target audience. No open vehicle is safe to operate without a helmet, and the archaic and ineffective lap belts in this movie only add to the incompetent image of whomever owns the go-cart track. Lack of knowledge about your subject guarantees that a script will be bad.Practical Outdoor Survival: A Modern Approach"
1,They keep falling.,I had a set of these before....but they were obviously not the same brand. These keep falling off the wall. I am not impressed!!
4,Excellent book for teens!,"The 7 habits of highly effective teens is the perfect book for teens. It's a book is a useful guide for teens. It tells what teen should do and not to do. It's a fun book to read. If you haven't already read this, your life is wasted..."
1,Waste of money,"These looked wonderful and were a birthday present for a close friend. When they came the foil was all stuck to the candy. We tried to unwrap a couple and it made a bigger mess with the paper sticking terribly to the candy. In the end we were able to taste the tiniest piece which just made us more disappointed and angry since it was delicious. We would never order these again or do business with this company. And living in Florida was not the problem since we paid BIG prices for the candy and shipping, it was not hot and the package was literally put in our hands from the truck, so it didn't sit outside. Big Big disappointment."
3,Solid but lacking,"This is a decent immersion blender for the price, but its biggest drawback is that it has only one speed which limits its utility. I was disappointed in that, but it was my error in not checking before I purchased it. The chopper is more trouble than it's worth and I didn't actually keep it."
4,"Love Brain Quest, but too easy","We have the 2yo pack through the kindergarten pack and love them. If your kid is 4, definitely get the 4-5 pack. I think this pack (3-4 yo)is more appropriate for 2-3 yos, but I generally like the questions to be more difficult so we have something to talk about, rather than just Q&A back and forth like she's being quizzed."
4,Harmonica blues-one of the best,"This is one of the best harmonica blues albums I have found. Some of the song lyrics are suggestive. Favorite track is #9- ""That Spot Right There"". This is one CD that will be played and not forgotten."
5,Never been released dvds??,"What are the episodes that this set have that was not revealed in the previous dvd collection?? I can bet that 1996,1998 Yankees plus Yankee Stadium episode will be there."
5,Awesome,"I have this product for a month now,and it really does work. My arms have gone down alot with rare exercise, when i used this product. I even used it on my back and by back slim down. How crazy is that?????I highly recomend this product."
2,Flawed,After looking at several Christmas karaoke CD's and their reviews I thought this one might work. How is it possible to screw up Christmas music? The arrangements are awful and most lack even a semblance of the melody of the songs. I don't mind if there aren't background vocals but when there's no melody it's very hard to sing the song. The other reason this purchase will be returned is the poor quality of the graphics. Words and lines are incomplete and there are areas of what I can only describe as pixilations. So I will be returning the product.
1,Not what I'd hoped for,"Perhaps my idea of Italian is too Americanized, but this music was not what I had in mind to play during a dinner party. Sorry. Didn't like it."
2,Mine was broken...,"I divide my time between two time zones, so when I saw this watch, I figured it was made for me. The trouble is, it didn't work, right out of the box, didn't work.I gave it two stars because I still love the design, because other Skagen watches I have gotten work just fine and because it was easy to return and to obtain a refund for the product.So, if you get it, I wish you luck. Really, it looks very cool."
2,Trashy,"I picked up this title based on the recommendation of a friend, and I have to say I was rather disappointed. I expected Ann Rice to be a virtuoso. She turned out to be a hack with an anal fixation. The dialogue and narration is only slightly better written than Penthouse letters, and the effect is less erotic. The only reason I rated the book as high as I did is because it read quickly, so at least I didn't waste a lot of time getting through it."
5,comfortable,"I ordered a left & a right - the first left I received was very tight in the thumb-hole; I needed to exchange it. Second one was doable, not as roomy as the right one I received, but OK enough not to return for a second exchange. These are lightweight, comfortable and do give a firm support. These replaced older heavier ones I had worn to death and I was skeptical at first of their shorter & sleeker design, but I found them to be just as effective - and they fold up much nicer for traveling."
2,A small error,"HelloI just bought a book from your company and there is a wrong fact in the book.Children's Writer's Word Book, 2nd edition. Copyright 2006 by Alijandra Mogilner and Tayopa Mogilner.It mentions on one of the first pages that Hispanics are from the Americas, while Latinos are from any place that speaks Spanish.This is wrong.In summary, Hispanics are those who speak spanish and latinos are from latin america including central america. As an example, somebody from Brazil is latin but not hispanic as they speak Portuguese in that country."
1,might as well be in Greek,"Basic primitives? Professor Milner, If you are writing a book for students, it helps if you make it comprehensible. We didn't all go to Cambridge."
3,Disappointed,The old Appleworks 6 had a n easy to use database. The iWorks is akin to Microsoft Works- the database is incorporated into the spreadsheet.
1,Chopped Up Goose,"It feels like they chopped up a goose and put it in this pillow. A few of its feathers are still on there, but they stick through! It is rough and pokey, even through a very nice pillowcase. Save your money and purchase a pillow that you would actually want to lay your head on. This is one of the worst pillows I have ever used."
1,Tedious,I wanted to like this movie but I was disappointed at how bad this was. There was nothing scary or funny about this movie.
5,Amazing!!!!,"I was on this site looking for more works written by Ann Marie Macdonald as I found Fall on your Knees to be brilliant!I read it about a year ago and I still remember the book. It pops into my head now and then and I remember how captivated I was while reading it. I too thought about this book 24hrs a day for weeks after I finished it. The psychology in it is amazing. It kind of toyed with your mind and I loved it!I am pleased to see that The Way the Crow Flies is out now and I can not wait to go out and get it!Keep the excelent writing coming Ann Marie, I will be looking for it!"
4,Smells Great!,I bought this shampoo as a filler item to make my order qualify for free shipping. My kids really liked it. It smells great and is gentle.
1,Better than Hatebreed?!,"Whoever said this band is better than Hatebreed is way off. These herbs don't even come close. Don't waste your money. Jersey has the worst ""hardcore"" bands ever."
1,How LAME,"You will like this movie if (1) you enjoy low-brow humor, (2) think hip-hop is the greatest thing since slice cheese, or (3) grew up with MTV.Face it, this story has been played out in the various Cheech & Chong films except now it features new faces from the MTV generation. It is geared for the throngs of minimum wage workers who can only dream of going to an Ivy League school and wreck havoc. If the purpose of the filmmaker was to make a movie about separation of the classes, they have failed miserably.With no respect for the sanctity of higher education and the benefits that such an education brings, we are given a film where drugs/race/sex can be played for all it's stereotypical humor if you use a couple of talentless hacks - who are no better off in a film studio than they are in a recording studio. This is Hollywood commercialization at its finest (or should I say lowest).Save your money people."
5,This is a good read,"I've never been a big believer in the paranormal, but I found this story to be very convincing and told in an entertaining way. It held my attention from the first page."
2,Alternatives,"The authors have 'dragged' out the last couple of books and it's very discouraging. They should stick to their earlier trend. However, in spite of this, I am anticipating this new book and will have it in my hands the day it hits the stand. Also, for anybody iterested, The Christ Clone Trilogy series is fantastic and readers of the Left Behind series will love these three books. I had to order them special after I tripped over a old review . They were written over 10 years ago. However, I noticed in BN a few weeks ago, they have been re-released in hard back. I can't recommend them enough. Everybody I have lent them to loved them. Talk about the edge of your seat!!!!!!!"
2,WHAT HAPPENED?!?!?!,SINCE WHEN DID CAROLE START TO DATE MOVIE STARS LISA MUST HAVE GONE CRAZY.SHE ALMOST FORGOT PRANCER AND STEVI IF SHE IS HAVING PROBLEMS WHY NOT TRY TO SEE YOUR HORSE HUH I WISH THAT YOU COULD RECONSDER THIS BOOK. OR CHANGE BACK TO HORSES.
3,Did it's job,"This item did it's job of holding my Christmas tree. However, this product was really bulky. I also noticed that it was starting to get some holes in it where some of the pokey parts of the branches were rubbing it. If you want something inexpensive to hold/protect your tree in then this is your product. It is not long lasting though."
2,Terrible,"I looked at the reviews for this movie, thought it'd be worth a shot. Terrible--I just didn't find much of anything funny. Maybe some of the themes in this movie are played out and has become dull. Only a small number of parts were funny. The chicks were hot though. Nicholas D'Agosto did a good job, I could care less about his partner. What's his name in the movie again?"
5,Great way to add more SATA drives!,Just use one of your old 4 pin connectors and add 2 new SATA connections. Works easily
1,useless,"If you're gambling in Vegas and can't figure these tips out by yourself, you shouldn't be there. Worst $14 I've ever spent."
1,Can someone please contact me????,I have yet to receive this merchandise and their is no contact info. Please help me AMAZON!
1,This is not an Authorized King James Version Bible,There are are word changes in the text of this book. Therefore it cannot be an Authorized King James Version Bible. It should not be billed as such.
1,Not what it appears to be!,"I was very disappointed with the quality of the product and the heart is very small, the picture does not depict what you're actually getting."
3,It's all over the map,"Stand Up is an album typical of the time it was produced. It's good, but fragmented. When you have such diverse talents as Peter Frampton, Eric Johnson and Allan Holdsworth on the same disc, it's bound to have high and low points. Alot of people who know Morse tend to want to have instrumentals only. I think it's great that there is at least some vocal work on this album, Alex Ledgerwood, on a tune co wrote with Frampton. It's not great, it's not bad, there are high points and low points. Enjoy the artistry and the effort. It's fun!"
3,Somewhat disappointed,"After reading all of the reviews of these headphones, perhaps my expectations were too high, but personally I'm disappointed.First is comfort. They ARE quite conmfortable, but not quite as comfortable as the reviews lead me to expect. If you need portable headphones, these are probably the most comfortable you will find, but if you just need phones for working at your desk, you can probably do better. This is really a minor quibble, though, since these are marketed as portable headphones.The sound is another matter. The sound is outstanding except for the bass-- it's overwhelming. Even after extensively fiddling with the eq, they still seem a bit bassy, though they're better.If I had it to do over again, I wouldn't buy these, but they're not so bad that I'd bother to return them..."
5,Beautiful Puzzle,My child is 4 and she really likes to make this puzzle and the image on it. She finds it challenging but not daunting. The quality and durability of the pieces seem adequate but not extraordinary.
3,A well done motion picture with an awesome soundtrack!,"A good movie in it's time, and great dialogue and sex scenes by Aidan Quinn and Daryl Hannah. A definite movie of the 80's! Even if this movie mainly focuses on the two of them there's good supporting roles by Adam Baldwin, Cliff DeYoung, Jennifer Grey, and Pamela Springsteen(The younger sister of rocker Bruce). Well acted and very convincing!"
3,3 stars,"Night In Eden started out strongly. I was intrigued with the Australian setting and sympathized with the hero and heroine. Both had experienced great losses recently and striving to overcome them.The character of Bryony was well-developed and multi-demensional, however, I felt a little cheated in regards to Hayden. I don't think there was enough from his point-of-view for me. I didn't always know what he was feeling or thinking. The author would touch on it, but not elaborate as she did with the heroine.The sexual tension was good, but I was expecting more from the rave reviews. There wasn't much of a build up. It was just all of a sudden ""I want her"". I wasn't ever sure if the hero ever really *loved* her.Overall, this was a good book. The writing style was favorable and the setting was different, but the many tragedies set a pall over it that didn't leave me ""satisfied"".This is my first book by this author and I will try another before giving up."
3,It was ok,"I love the fact that this is a clean book with Christian elements. Jeanette Oke is a wonderful writer and I commend her for her talent. However, she spends a great deal of the book describing the countryside, the train rides, the food, the coyotes, etc. and I'm more interested in interactions with people and their dialogue. I wish the romance would have developed further. It took a long time for Elizabeth and Wynn to figure things out and then suddenly they are engaged and the story ends. I guess that's why this is in a series. It was not a bad book. I just prefer a different style of writing."
3,Could have been better,"This is a good album, If it was Murphy Lees. Come on Jigga for your last album, It should have been way tighter then this. Ive heard better from you in the past."
2,"The Stepford Wives - Updated, But Not a New Premise","What a disappointment! I was intrigued, initially, until I got about 25 pages into this book and discovered it was ""The Stepford Wives"" with a twist. Since there was nothing much original, although well written enough, I rated this two stars. Had it been poorly written, it would have rated zero for lack of originality and, essentially, copying Ira Levin's premise with the twist that the men are the puppets and the women the masters. I did finish the book, but wouldn't waste the money purchasing it for anything more than 25 cents at a flea market."
4,Nice Product,"The product arrived sooner then expected, and was well packaged. The quality is good, but the postage was almost as much as the product."
4,Fast paced and funny.,"I wasn't expecting the book to be like it is. I was expectiong a lot more romance since it's supposed to be a paranormal romance book. I was a little disappointed about that aspect but recovered when I realized what a fun read this was. There aren't that many vampire books out there that aren't all gore and horror, so I loved that this wasn't that way.I'm looking forward to reading Michelle Rowen's next book."
1,Not durable at all!,I've only used it once for 15-20 minutes. The motor part got very hot after 15 minutes and then the teeth on the gear in the housing stripped out. I could not fix it because part of it stuck in the replacement head.Amazon CSR was very nice and gave me full refund. Anyway this product is definitely not worth the money...
2,It was ok....,"I bought this movie thinking it was going to be like all other gibli films, but...in some ways it was and in others...not so much. ( sorry in advance for my spelling issues)Pros:beautiful art workGood story baseCons:The story line was to choppy, and it left WAY to many questions unanswered ( i have not read the books)The story is really slow and draging in some partsBig build up to....what? I think i missed it....i didnt get the ending at all.So over all if you like to just look at great art work, or you've read the books and know whats going on, this movie would be great, and i'm really sad that i have to say the storyline wasn't good."
1,Fine... when it works,"I got a margarator for christmas. Now, I'm not greedy, I understand that this thing won't churn out restaurant-quality margs, and that's fine. But it didn't work at all. So, I returned it and got another. It made some good drinks. Watery? Yes. Lumpy? Yes. I could produce better margs with my home blender, but it takes a lot more work. So, the margarator delivered a decent enough product. That is, until it broke. I used it 4-5 times, and then it just fizzled out and stopped working. Evidently, they aren't made to last. More is the pity."
4,Thoroughly enjoyable travelogue,"Paul Theroux' Dark Star Safari is an engaging thougtful descripotion of the author's journey from Cairo to Capetown in 2000. He travels by bus, train, minivan, truck, riverboat and describes his encounters with chance meetings with people in all walks of life in each of the countries he visits. He is perceptive and often critical of the state of affairs in all the lands. He particularly chastises the aid and relief organizations who start idealized projects and often abandon them without reaching any meaningful goals. He compares the state of affairs in this trip with what he saw as a young Peace Corps volunteer and teacher in Malawi in the 1960s, and finds most institutions, including schools and infrastructure to have become deplorable in the intervening generation. His critial stance is convincing."
3,"Good date movie, but every character talks like Woody Allen","I won't delve into the plot, acting, scenery, editing and everything else that constitutes a movie. Plenty other reviewers do that. This movie didn't have to be believable (the grad student who knows little Spanish and spends no time in the library) or particularly witty (wow, did a character actually use the phrase ""turgid argument about the categorical imperative""?)....I was just irritated that every character sounded like Woody Allen! Whiney, self-absorbed, quick to moralize about everything objectionable....could the man get out in the real world and listen to how other people talk? Heck, even reading a book by Richard Price might help him...."
2,Doesn't work...,"I was pretty excited about this, but it doesn't work very well at all. the narrow mouth on the food processor means that you have to cut the potato into halves/quarters to fit. then the disk just ends up making little potato chunks, in addition to just shredding/wasting a bunch of potato."
5,Does What Its Supposed To,"I've been using the Troll for several months now, and it does a very good job with 3/4"" mdf and ply. 4x8 sheets just do not have good handles on them and my arms are not 4 feet long. With this tool you stand them on their side, lift up a bit, slide it under and take off. You would think that maybe the wheels are a little small to get over obstructions, but the handle makes it easy to lift the wheels up and over, in fact most of the time I am using the Troll to carry the sheets without using the wheels anyway. The bottom rail is long enough to give you good balance. The outer edge of the rail is kicked up to keep the sheets from working their way off it. All in all, it does what it is designed to do very well and makes it tolerable for one person to handle big sheets."
1,LOAD...,"DON'T WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY. BUY THEIR PRE SELLOUT ALBUMS, KILL EM ALL, RIDE THE LIGHTNING, MASTER OF PUPPETS, AND AND JUSTICE FOR ALL."
3,Does the Job,"These are good, but I use them rarely. Crumpets & english muffins are a ""sometimes"" food for us. Also good for making eggs though."
1,go back to the ephedra pills,"I thought I would try this (bought it before the ephedra ban was lifted in April) since it was in my cupboard. I have taken it 2 days now and both days I have been sick to my stomach about 5 hours after taking it. I didnt even take full strength yet. Not a good way to curb the appetite. Go back to the diet pills with ephedra in them, they are excellent, I usually lost 1/2 pound per day on those. Spend your money on something else."
4,Smart rolling bag,"This is a great bag if you need to be highly organized and cram lots of gear into it. Four stars instead of five because it should have double rolling wheels rather than two singles. Nevertheless, it is the second one we've purchased because we haven't found one to top it for the price."
2,Plot Goes AWOL,"I loved the RAMA books, but I felt totally burned by this Clarke outing.Through the whole volume Clarke used the device of a mystery--raising motivational questions about the many underdeveloped characters (including the protagonist)--but then the book ended without resolving a single loose thread.If he was making some point about race (a theme so undeveloped that it baffled me every time a character's race was mentioned), I didn't get it.I didn't find the futurism especially novel, either (at least not as a reader in 2001--perhaps it was more exciting in 1976).The ending (and I use the term only because I ran out of pages) left me asking ""What the &%? Am I missing some pages?""--reminiscent of the film ending of ""2001 A Space Odyssey"".Unlike that film (or the Philip K. Dick stories I've read), the interest of the ride didn't make up for the unresolved storyline. It's easily the poorest of the 7 or 8 Clarke novels I've read."
5,"Waking the Dead, finally in the US","I fell in love with this show on BBCAmerica and waited not so patiently for it to come out on Region 1 DVD.Well worth the price I paid, just wish it had some extras, cast interviews, behind the scenes look, etc."
1,Don't defend the spoiled,"Paris Hilton is a waste of human space. I am sorry but she is. People say, oh look...she can feed cows and do normal things.....HELLO! She does it b/c she is getting paid a ton of money and oh it's furthering her ""career"". I think you will find that people do not take her seriously because she is not a serious person. I am not down on all celebs, but I support the celebs that are actually involved in helping people and in the community rather than celebs (wait, can you even call her that???) who are just interested in themselves. I just think there are so many more people out there who are prettier both inside and out. There are people out there who have come to accomplish great things and they didn't do it with Daddy's credit card or their last name."
2,Hp 96 Black & Hp 97 Color Ink Cartridges (Pack of 2),"Since I have purchased this product, the first time I replaced the Ink Cartridges on 1/26/2010, both worked ok.The very next day my HP DeskJet 6980 printer STOP printing, the ink indicator were solid.The ONLY way my Pinter would work, is by removing the color ink cartridge from my printer.So I paid for a package of 2 ink cartridges and I can ONLY use the back ink cartridge to get my printer to work .This is unacceptable and if someone needs to correct this situation please relay to my e-mail on how to do so."
3,Way ahead of it's time,"This writer was way ahead of his time. This book to me was difficult to understand, but then, i'm probably not the most intelligent person out there. It's one that you have to read slowly. Each sentence says a lot. Sort of like the bible. A required reading in some schools. Just not my cup of tea. Probably more for the intellictual types."
4,70's Nostalgia,"BTO did pen some popular songs after spinning off from The Guess Who. I actually saw BTO in concert at Hampton Roads Colosseum (Virginia) in the early 1970's. The opening act happened to be Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band (go figure...). Little did I know that the bands would end up on opposite ends of the spectrum when it came to career longevity. Regardless, I like this album because it contains one gem that never got the recognition that it deserves... the very mellow, ""Blue Collar"" (cut #7). Try playing ""Blue Collar"" at night when you're cruising down the Interstate or a back-country road... the lyrics and beat really make the drive a pleasure. I only wish BTO would have drifted in that same direction with other songs."
3,"Average, likeable, but ultimately forgetable.","Take a good movie like Shrek, which parodies all fairy tales, and then parody that. Then you have Ella Enchanted. The plot of the story is very unstructured, and behind it is fake effects, cheesy 70s music, and slapstick humor. The film wasn't entirely likeable but it wasn't a family film disaster. Anne Hathaway comes through brilliantly as usuall, but she did lack a little. Vivaca Fox also lacked usual spunk, and Minnie Driver was awfully bland at times. Another thing was that 3/4 of the characters spoke with British accents, and Ella magically didn't (Hmmm) The fantasy characters were not so rememberable either. The prince's role in the film, wasn't played out entirely bad by what's his name, and I am sure he will be in many more films. The movie will not become a ""Wizard of Oz"" of its time but it doesn't fail. An average film, that will be overlooked and buried in the years to come."
5,Just in time,"After a head on collision two years ago, I doubted my ability to recover and whether I would ever walk again. Reading ""Right Risk"" provided me with the impetus to move forward by taking many risks from finally driving a car again to returning to work at a time when jobs are hard to come by.Right Risk has helped me focus on what's important in my life from my family to friends and making contact with relatives that I haven't seen in many years. I can relate to the nine limiting scripts as I have experienced most of them. It's good to know that I am not alone.Right Risk is a well written book, and I encourage everyone to read it, as we are all exposed to some sort of risk each and every day of our lives, and we need to know how to overcome our fear of risk. Accolades to Bill Treasurer."
3,Not at all right for the Blues Jr.!!!,"The previous reviewer is correct. This speaker strongly favors the treble frequencies and the geniuses at Fender decided to put it in their new Limited Edition 2-tone ""Black/Red"" Blues Junior. And what do you get? Nothing but top end. Cranking up the bass knob makes no audible difference. Nice going guys! But it's really not as ""shrill"" as all that though. It's actually a smooth, somewhat creamy treble character... just lots of it. I can see these speaker working well if you have a muddy, bottom-heavy 4x12"" stack to get more articulation, or combining them with some Governors or some such like that ~"
5,Very convenient travel cart,"Although I had a ballhopper with a 75-ball capacity, I bought this product for three reasons: (1) larger capacity (this one comes at 150 balls), (2) to ease pain on the shoulder when you carry them (ballhopper's thin handles really hurt your shoulder), and (3) rolling on the ground. This cart satisfied me on all three counts."
2,Instrumentals Non-essential,"With Trojan Records, you'd think you'd pretty much be in the arms of Jah with anything you buy. Not necessarily so, here. Although this collection contains some decent standouts from the Harry J All Stars et. al, most of the material borders on kitsch and comes off as somewhat dispensable within just the first listen, unlike much of the instrumental/dub work of Lee Scratch/Upsetters. Unless you're dedicated to collecting all these box sets, go with another and you might get a few of the better selections offered here."
2,Another Chore,"Generally when I pick up a novel I expect to get something out of it. Having to read this for my English class I found it to be a chore. Rhys expanded on a character who was ment to be a mystery. Although it did have it's moments (the uprising of the slaves) it lacked in the delopement of Rochester of Antionette (Bertha). I cannot say it was not teh worst piece of litureture I have read for nothing compare with Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, but I did feel left a little empty as to why some of things happened the way they did. I would recoomend this novel to anyone who as enough time to comprehend the true nature of it."
5,a book to keep close by at all times,"This book is a must for anyone who is remotely intersted in information on the unitarian universalist church. It is very welcoming to anyone who reads it, especially those of us who have left organized religion in the past and felt there would never be any turning back. The book compares and contrasts the UU church to other western religions as well as eastern in a non biased way. It really gives the reader something concrete and tangible regarding the beliefs of the church. It is written on my level in the sense that there is no condescention or judgement. I knew I would like it from the first page. What a pleasure to find a book that helps answer my questions on liberal faith! It is the kind of book I will always keep at my beside for rereading and reviewing."
2,The Point?,"What is Sallie Tisdale trying to say with this book? I read the entire book over the course of 3 months (small portions) and I never discovered ""the secret of food."" This book is over 311 pages of disconnected musings. Each musing is well-written but there isn't a coherent whole. Its more like a coherent hole. A second helping? No thank you."
3,Very slow map rendering,"It is easy to use. But like one of the reviewers (RA Fellows, April 27) said, the maps rendering/redrawing is very slow compared to other units, such as Tomtom and Mio. It is quite annoying when you have to wait at least a few seconds for the hour glass to go away before you can do anything. Other GPS instantly redraw the map as you zoom in/out. Also, this GPS does not let you zoom in continuously or multiple levels at a time. Basically, you have to zoom in or out 1 level at a time, then wait for the hourglass to go away, then zoom to next level, then wait again, and so on. Takes forever to zoom all the way in or out."
1,Disappointed,"I was so excited with i got my Creative Zen Stone. Yes the charge life was horrible, but that was not much of a concern for me. I liked the fact that it was small and perfect for working out. Overall i thought it was a neat little gadget until it suddenly stopped working after 2 months. I attempted to turn it on one afternoon and the creative logo appeared on the screen and wouldn't go away. I could not access my music and the device would not turn off . I'm highly disappointed...i expected more from this company."
3,Very disappointing,"While showcasing the best picture for the film yet, the Blu-Ray version of the film lacks everything else. No extras at all, no commentaries, no comic... If you are a videophile, this is the best version, but if you love this film you need the DVD collector's edition."
2,Fun is diminished by it not staying together,"My 9-year-old really enjoys the dragon series, but only when he ignores the directions and configures his own castles. The Draigar castle simply will not stay together per the directions. If you have a child that likes to build according to directions, stay away from this one."
4,Italian cook book,"My Mother told me of this cook book,so I bought her one too,we love Italian food.Great Cook Book."
3,Not very loud,This horn was easy to install but it is not a loud horn. I should have gone with an onboard air system and a train horn.
1,not good enough,"bought this for my daughters birthday. She enjoys it as much as any other toy, but I was disapointed with the quality and variety. Does not spin without a block. Putting the blocks into the shape sorter or plug n play does nothing. Knobs and flip doors do nothing. Just not good enough"
2,Proteins or Calories?,"Amazingly I gained two sizes in 10 days and gained 8 pounds of weight, I was losing weight working very hard everything was going fine till someone advised me to have proteins in the morning; I found this and screwed up all my hard work from last six months. Don't know what to do... Who tests as what is printed on the box is true or not..."
3,It's ok,"I was recommended to read this book because I was in search for something with the likes of the Hitchhikers guide to the galaxy, but I'm only 75% into this book, and only finishing it just to finish the book. But I wasn't into it that much.But for those that like books about wizards, and magicians and gargoyles and stuff like that, then this would be your book."
5,Love It!!!,This album is refreshing and needed. Robin Thicke not only show great vocal ablity but range. The music arrangements have a classic yet contemporary feel. There were only two songs I wasn't ecstatic about. That says a lot since much of the music cd's today lack consistancy of good songs. I highly recommend this CD for anyone who enjoys music that is not recycled and/or cloned. Well done Robin!!!
5,Excellent,"As I am disabled with Cerebral palsy and can not use my hands I can't hold a book. The kindle makes it very easy for me to read a book. It has given me a freedom to read more, even though I have to have my wife to turn it on and off for me. I like the way you can make the words bigger so it is easier to read. I can read not just on the computer but I can read anywhere."
2,smokey's bests is not a fair collection from fan's point of view,"was very disappointed in the selections, even though i reviewed them beforew i bought it. just wanted heis best hits to reminess. did not happen ge"
2,Less than great,So far of all my dragonball DVDs this is my least favoriteit's short Like the rest of them but I can not get into itthis movie is not that important so I would skip it.
2,Component Failures,"After 13 months of occasional use, the hard drive failed. Two months later the power supply died, the next month the motherboard went south.Based on that experience with Sony, I wouldn't recommend this product."
5,I've been a user of Body Drench for over 12 years!,"That's right I have used Body Drench for a long time! I first bought it at a salon in Maryland when I was on vacation and forgot to bring my lotion. I'm 60 years old now and it is hard to find a lotion that will soften enough. Body Drench not only softens enough, it keeps my skin soft all day. I have gotten compliments on how good I smell when all I have used is the Body Drench. It is a little on the pricey side but, if you buy the larger sizes it all equals out. I have asked for it as a Christmas gift and look forward to getting it. I recommend it to everyone I hear complaining about their chapped hands and dry skin. It is a wonderful product and will keep it on my Christmas list for a long, long time."
1,Blew away the controller on first try,Don't buy this one. I blew it with just 2 panels and its supposed to handle up to 7 or so. And the company that makes them doesn't know a darn thing about the unit. Just a marketing company. Buyer beware is my thought on this product.
5,GREAT Movie,"This was a great ""sequel"" movie. I thought it started slow but once it developed its own plot and strayed away from the first, it was hilarious. I've never heard so many people laugh in a movie theater."
4,great product,"This product is a great way to save money by replacing the ipod on your battery. The intructions are thorough and all the necessary tools are provided. The replacement process is very precise, so I don't recommend buying the product if you don't think you can handle the precise work."
5,Excellent,"This is fine recording of this rarely performed opera. Soderstrom specialized in Janacek and her performance is excellent. I think this opera contains some of Janacek's best music. In my experience, few are indifferent about Janacek; either its enthusiasm or disdain. For those who are enthusiastic, this recording is a fine investment."
4,Not 5 stars ONLY because...,"I really love this DVD. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because of the mention of arm balances, and it turned out that there were none. Or maybe there were, but none that I consider to be arm balances... Anyway, I have been doing yoga off and on for about a year. Each time I stop and start, I can pretty much get back into it without a problem. I do the MTV Yoga DVD (which is also awesome; check it out). Rodney Yee's Power Yoga is definitely faster than any yoga I have ever done, and I love that. I was looking for Power Yoga and I found it. I don't know if someone who is exceptionally advanced would benefit from this DVD, but for the intermediate level it's a gem. By the way, the backbends are crazy!...but in a good way:) You'll be sore the next day, but if you keep it up, you'll be toned and strong in a very short amount of time."
3,Good movie with excellent acting,"Clint Eastwood and John Malkovich are at their very bests in this spell-binding and original thriller. Eastwood, in a role not far removed from his ""Dirty Harry"", plays a veteran U.S. Secret Service Agent who is constantly haunted by his failure to prevent the assassination of Present Kennedy 30 years ago. However, Eastwood gets a shot at redemption when a mysterious stranger sets his sights on assassinating the current president. John Malkovich is terrific as the killer: a master of deception who thrives on mind-games and doing more psychological than physical harm to our hero. Plenty of twists and surprises, superb acting and a great script makes In The Line of Fire a fine chapter in the legendary career of Clint Eastwood."
2,unpredictable,"I have had this camera for two years...The battery life is EXTREMELY POOR....have two batteries and for a day out, it is not enough...many times the memory stick causes errors....lighting is tricky, sometimes pictures come out good, most time bad....lighting is always a problem....outdoors too much, indoors not enough...this is my second digital camera and have decided to go back to my old film based Minolta which had never dissapointed me...."
1,disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this product. It was advertised as sugar free chocolate mint candy, but I could find no chocolate taste in it whatsoever. I also thought the description ""4-ounce unit (pack of 12) a little confusing. I was pretty surprised to find I paid $18.88 for a tiny little bag of candy that didn't taste all that great. No thanks."
4,Great for a little self-taught italian!,"I decided to teach myself italian, and after reading many amazon.com reviews I settled on this book (and two others) to help me. I think this is essential, because most of the general workbooks do not focus on such in depth verb conjugation, and that is so important when learning a new language. This actually made the workbook I got easier to do, because it gave such great explanations....it is very user friendly!"
1,Waste of Money,"I bought the Sony based on Sony's reputation. Obviously baby monitors are not their specialty. There is almost always static, and I can hardly walk to my front door without the range alarm beeping."
4,"Not a 2-pack, no cases","The description and user photo indicated this would be a two-pack of SD cards, and the photo showed they came with plastic cases. What I received was two individually wrapped SD cards, without cases. Slightly misleading, and I'll add a photo later that will show two separate cards, so people will know what they are getting.Shipping was quick and packing was good. These will be presents so I won't get to use the cards themselves to review."
2,"More Science, Less Edubabble","The best part of this book is Dr. Melvin Levine's introduction. I would like to have read more of the doctor's analysis of this condition. The author only had the benefit of a six day class with Dr. Levine. I think a solid two semesters of pediatric neuropsychology would be more appropriate for anyone working in this area or teaching in general!Although the author does a good job of describing the condition and has some excellent examples provided by afflicted children, she largely fails to provide a practical way out. She does little to discuss testing and how parents can deal with teachers and school systems. The bulk of the book is a blizzard of educationese about teaching writing. I am dealing with a 7th grader and her technics seems more appropriate to third graders.Fortunately, it is not an expensive book and I recommend it for that. You may find something useful here but I can't raise your hopes too high."
1,Beware of Insignia,"This player has a 90 day warranty. It quit working on day 99. Probably used less than 50 hours. No option to fix it. No suggestions from customer service to troubleshoot it. Just ""sorry, I can't help you if you didn't buy the extended warranty."" My guess is their only option is to replace it. I wonder 'if' you had the warranty and got another one, would they replace the second one,or would you need 'another warranty'. Or more likely, would it be a one time only option. I would never buy anything else with that name. The Best Buy salesperson strongly recommended it! It was about the highest priced portable dvd they had!"
3,Big and Heavy,"This saucier is big and heavy. It occupies so much space on my four burner stove that make the burners behind and beside this saucier unusable. Also, it has a lot of metal so it takes a while to heat up even on a gas stove. Forget it if you have an electric stove."
4,very fast arrival,"I ordered this syrup on Monday with standard shipping and Thursday night it arrived. Shipping is more then most items on Amazon, but with such a fast turn around rate I wouldn't let that keep you from ordering this product."
5,Best bib yet,"The t-shirt is cute but the bib is great! Easily wipes clean (so I can use it for more than one meal a day), covers more of my 10-month-old than infant bibs but the neck opening and overall size are more comfortable for him than toddler bibs."
5,Celinerrrrrrrrrific!,"This is a great DVD filled with wonderful bonuses! It's also sold at a great price! You have access behind the scenes and it just makes me wonder why I never attened the concert myself! This is a must-have for any Celine fan! Celine is a true artist and her personality shines throughout the DVD. She is just an icon that everyone should look up to. She is wonderful, and they made a superb dvd. The songs are wonderful, she sings her best hits! This gets a triple A plus from me!"
3,Not Bad but Jeez enough already we get it!!,"Ok here is the deal, this is a pretty good series (The first book being Dies the Fire) but my lord every time we get to Junipers story all we get are a series of minstral songs and about 50 pages of ""Blessed be"" and wiccan blah blah blah.WE get it she is a witch ooooh aaaaah but man does the author really need to remind us every 5th word?The storyline involving The Bearkillers is entertaining though and I realise that its a book but are we really suppose to believe that within 6 moths of the Change happening a large portion of humanity would become cannables? and the loss of electricity and gunpowder would lead to the death of tens of millions...dont think so.I gave it 3 stars becasuse it is an intresting idea and half of the book is pretty fun but my advice is to just skim the Juniper, Clan Mackenzie storyline there really is very little of intrest there."
3,You can do Better with your Money,"Positives: detailed fluid sound, especially for a non-moving coil cartridge. Surface noise is kept to an acceptable level. Its ""middle of the road"" specifications should give it a wide arm compatibility. Though I would not recommend mounting it to a cheap tonearm. I had it initially attached to a Pro-ject 8.6"" carbon arm, and the sound was too bass heavy. Compared to an ortofon 2m red, this cartridge is quite a lot betterNegatives: Sound isn't dynamic enough; kinda too laid back. Its worst feature is the humming it emits when close to AC power sources. Ie the vast majority of belt driven turtable motors! I wouldn't recommend it on this basis alone.I would very much recommend a Denon Dl-103 over this cartridge, as the price is comparable, yet the denon is a true moving coil cartridge with a very solid and dynamic performance, most probably the King at around $200 price level, with NO HUM!! Thanks for reading."
1,Painfully bad,"The low budget mediocre acting is somewhat forgivable, but I can't look past the over the top plot and emotional psychosis of the main character. What should have been a quirky romantic comedy turned into an incestuous love fest where everyone is sleeping with everyone else. Not only is it a cliche and tired plot, but far from anything remotely realistic. Furthermore the main character is painful to even watch as she traipses through life being ""easy"" as it were because she's an emotional vampire. In the end we question whether she can be happy with any of the characters, much less the man she ends up with, because she can't ever be happy on her own.None of these characters are exactly role models nor do any of them actually make for an interesting movie. Save your time and money on this one due to its sheer lack of originality."
2,Cheap Board,"I enjoyed this new deluxe board because of its ability to rotate. However, I took it to a friend's house and left it in the car for about 2 hours the result was not pretty. The cheap overlay that forms the surface that you play on melted and warped. Despite attempts to reshape it I had to trash the whole set. For fifty dollars I think the manufacter could have made a product that stood up to 80 degree day."
1,Looks nice but doesn't work.,"I purchased this product in the fall of 2010. It was replaced with a new unit by Cuisinart in July of 2011 as it had stopped heating and percolating. That new unit also died after displaying the same symptoms in April of 2012, and I returned it again as was still under the original warranty.The second time around they replaced a fuse and sent it back (wouldn't it be nice if we could still replace our own fuses?). Although it functions, the cycle is shorter and the coffee isn't great.If you're looking for a good quality percolator, keep looking as this one isn't it. A product that fails twice during the warranty period is just not acceptable. It's my time and money every time I have to package the whole thing up and walk it to the post office, so purchasing a more expensive, quality unit in the first place would have been cheaper in the end. After this experience I doubt that I will every buy another Cuisinart product."
2,rusty cutters :(,"i was so happy to finally try out some new cookie cutter shapes, and for a set of Wiltons purchased from the local bed, bath and beyond, i couldnt resist. they worked well the first time i used them, but unfortunately, they rusted from after i washed them. from this experience, i know from now on to purchase stainless steel ones instead of whatever these are made from."
3,Disappointing,"This book has two major problems: 1) It's too long. 2) The ending is anti-climactic. That doesn't bode well, especially when we've all waited so long for this latest Harry Potter installment. This is my least favorite book of them all. It's long and drawn out, and although there is major suspense leading to the end, it doesn't lead to much.I'm giving it three stars because it is still entertaining. I was only bored at the very beginning. After the first 10 chapters or so, things get quite interesting. There is a lot of suspense, there are funny parts, and other things that you expect to find in a Harry Potter book. But overall, it is not up to par with the other books in the series. I hope Book 6 will meet my expectations better."
4,More fun in teenland,"Their sophomore effort is overall a fun ride, and contains some top notch moments like ""Tearproof"" and ""Wednesday Week"" -- songs that pinpoint that poignant yearning feeling of youth. And then there's the playful, self-mocking teen angst tunes like ""More songs about Chocolate and Girls"" and ""My Perfect Cousin"". It's similar to their first album, with some songwriting development. Great fun, really."
3,Good Product......But!!!!!!,"Good product but the lettering for the functions on the remote control are smallish (which to people in their 50's is critical). Also, the timed recording mode cannot be turned on or off - if there is any item in the programming menu the VCR will be in the recording mode and will record whether the unit is turned on or off."
1,Beautifully written,"This is a clearly written work on grief and loss coupled with a message of hope that JVP is uniquely qualified to deliver. Once again, he delivers the good news to those that need it."
2,Not for tall people,"This product in design is a good idea, putting the child up in front of the parent so they can interact and the child can see where they are going, but talk about poor design for the parent.I am 6'2"" and my knees are now bruised thanks to this seat. Dont get me wrong, it is possible to ride with this on your bike, if you are willing to ride bow legged. If you hit an uphill stretch and want to really pump on the pedals, be prepared for some pain because its tough to get some torque on the pedals if your knees are splayed out to the side.I am going to return this one and buy my next option, the green front mounted seat. The reviews on that one seem to solve my problem. I will keep you posted on how that turns out.Add in the poor strapping system, and somewhat shaky mount, and this is only a 2 star product. It better be 4 stars or better, after all, this is the safety of my son I'm talking about."
5,The audio cd is powerful and the voice will keep you awake,"This man is a great person for making this into audio , my friend gave me this cd and as soon as I started to listen all my goals and thoughts became alive. I found my goals were not big enough and when I did make my goal as big as Mr.Chandler said My goals came into focus . My goal ? 5 Computer certs to make over $75,000 by the age of 27 im 26 and 90 % there with my recent raise.The simple circle planets will have you go why Could I not have started this at age 18"
1,Poor quality..,"Very poor quality. Made with a very low quality material and got torn the very first time my son wore this. Eligible for ""0"" star rating. Don't buy this product."
2,I'm not impressed,"Businesswise,I can see the logic behindthis release.Ricky Martin blew up thespot,and now is the time for Latinos torepresent.Yeah,yeah,yeah...I get it,butstill,Jennifer isn't the one. For starters,My Love sounds like everyother mediocre R&B fluff joint litteringthe Urban format today.What,Brandy hadthe day off? It is very clear to me thatPuff's worked OT on this one,but Jennifer's voice doesn't bring it,notlike other Boricuas(India comes to mind),her voice lacks that uhhhh! needed tomake this album work. Regardless,it should do well.I neversaid the video was wack,and in the visual arena,Ms.Lopez is always on point.Do us all a favor,Jennifer.Stick to acting,and leave music to the pro's."
1,Hate the clips,"The rollers literally fell out my first time using them. The clips are horrible and have no grip whatsoever. My hair is slightly past my shoulders and normal thickness. The ""stay cool"" edges of the rollers burned my fingers. I haven't tried any other kind of clip other than what is sold with the set. I can't tell you how well they curl because I couldn't get the rollers to stay in my hair. I am not happy with these rollers."
1,E Unibus Plurum,"Take out a quarter and look at the other motto besides 'In God We Trust'.It says in Latin: E pluribus unum = out of many, one.This book unwittingly, but as accurately pegged by a prior reviewer, flip-flops the motto and has that represent theMosaic of Christian Beliefs:E unibus plurum = out of one, many.What we have here is a sacrifice of Unity of Christian Truth to the Diversity of Academic Freedom and Theological License.Jesus said clearly, 'Thy Word is Truth', NOT 'truths', and especially NOT 'what you think is truth (A) and what I think as truth (non-A) so long as we agree to disagree even on some fundamental doctrines.'See the book 'Across the Spectrum' for how far this Mosaicism notion gets carried among some hyper-imaginative devangelicals."
5,I miss this item.,I sure wish these kleenex were manufactured again. They are the only ones to use when you have a cold.
4,FM pop that doesnt disappoint,"This is the only Steely Dan album I have, and Im not sure Id enjoy any other as much. 'Reelin In the Years', 'Do it Again' and 'Midnight Cruiser' are all songs on the album that have listening value for me."
1,SLEEPER,"willem Defoe is a great actor but the story is soooo slow i fell asleep.I got what the story was about half way thru and i wish the movie had more action,something to make the movie more fun to watch.....boring........yawn........."
4,"About time, really.","Well, finally the turtles is coming out, and not just the first 5 (even if it was a whole season).Anyway, I'm glad about it, but you would expect that something as successful as this show, would have some special features. Turtles raked in billions of dollars. It would be nice to see some Eastman and Laird interviews, or a documentary on how real Turtles started selling like mad, and kids were flushing them down the toilet, thinking that they'd like to live in the sewers.There was such a huge impact on a generation with this show, it would just be nice to see some evidence of it again, that's all.(Only 4 stars because there are no features. Otherwise, the episodes are worth 5)"
5,Works Great,"The filter works great and has made a noticeable difference in the cars performance. That said it did lower the cars average mpg, but not much."
5,I like Automoblox,This toy is colorful and designed well with good fit and finish. Parts can be swapped with other Automoblox cars.
2,This is best cookbook I ever owned!!!,"I have a ton of cookbooks and enjoy them all. But this cookbook is fun and the receipes are quick and inexpensive to prepare. It gives you neat ideas whether you are preparing brunch, lunch, or dinner. I have one that I bought several years ago when my children were younger. They would always use this cookbook, because the receipes are so simply and easy to follow. So if getting in and out if the kitchen ""quick"" is your idea of fast food, try this book!"
2,"After the Ice, was man really so simple?","A shallow and rather trite psuedo-scientific review, I find it difficult to believe he skipped over the really huge megalitic sites (Tiahunaco, Baalbek, etc) to focus on our ""evolution"". Animals and plants are miraculously domesticated -- There is much more to the history of man in the past 20,000 years than this basic repeating of the textbook history that's been taught in schools of Western (Eurocentric)thought for a long time. Some of it is interesting, though. An easy read."
4,Decent,Arrrived early and was in good shape.The top has to be put on which was a little tough but a bit of elbow grease got it in.Its being holding wine just fine all week.Note: If you have wine in the lower rack theres not enough room to have standing bottles of alcohol on the bottom shelf.
2,This soundtrack has little to do with the movie,"After seeing the movie, I was not only impressed by its story and special effects, but also by its fantastic music. With 'its' music I mean the specially written musicscore, not the popsongs. With this in mind I bought the soundtrack. What a mistake! It's nothing more than a average CD with some nice songs on it. The music I was after, was only represented by a 3 minutes track! So, if you like nice songs, buy this CD. But if you're after the fantastic movie-music, DON'T! (P.S. Can anybody tell me how or where I can get the original music-score?)"
4,Really comfortable,"The crutches are really comfy but the only disadvantage is that it has a distinct plastic smell that may annoy you for a little while. And your hand gets that smell too when you hold the handle for a while. Getting that smell off your hands is a little hard. But that smell soon goes away in a week or so. Else, it's the best crutches I have ever used."
5,"Anyone who appreciates music, will appreciate this.","If you're into deep, moody rock with a twist on the standard form, this CD is for you. I first discovered the band live with Evanescence, and though they have a quite different sound than the latter, true rock fans will really appreciate the album. The band doesn't just do the standard love-and-betrayal thing, it goes further...into a mystical world of aliens, mothra, and school-yard pencil fights (well, metaphoricly). Good choice for a good ear... but if you're a new-to-rock teenybopper who only is here because of their link to Evanescence, I'd suggest something a little lighter."
3,Great Photos - great spirit - now learn to write!,"The photos and scope of this book are wonderful. I believe that Mr. Allen loves and knows Swing Dancing. Unfortunately, he does not know how to write a coherent English sentence! From the Introduction: ""The eyes of the individual learning to dance are very deceptive we have learned that you only see the result of force and not what or even where is the generation of that force energy."" Yikes! I think there is gold to be mined from this book, but be prepared to do some prospecting and dig deep."
3,ONLY WORTH SEEING FIRST THREE FIGHTS AT THE END,This film was ok but only worth watching the first three fights near the end of the film the rest of them were the other actor fighting. If you live in the U.K. you won't see the first fight its been cut from the film all in all its a good try but not the real thing.
4,Bruce,Works great.recommended by person who refinished our floors. Looks like new every time we clean. Sometimes it's a bit slippery
1,such a shame,"Too bad. This book starts out fantastic. Props to the author for putting together the best 95-page introduction to C++ I've yet read...but all of a sudden, at page 96, it becomes utterly worthless as the instructions for installing all the included software are fake or wrong or incomplete or something. Whatever happened, I hope it was the publisher's fault and not the author's, because I believed in him 100%. Really, too bad."
4,ha.,"better than his other books. i thought naked was boring and weird, a little self indulgent. this is really funny and interesting. stories about his dad are both funny and touching, and the essay about his brother the rooster is classic. check it out."
5,Raisel's Riddle,"Raisel's Riddle is a story that gives profound meaning to the Cinderella fairy tale , Jewish-style. Instead of beauty being the criterion for selection of a wife, Raisel's intelligence and knowledge are the ""charms"" that win the heart of ""Prince Charming,"" who in this story is a rabbi's son. Another irony is that instead of the woman having to pass the test of beauty, the man has to pass the test of intelligence and wit before Raisel agrees that he is fit to be her husband. Contrary to the feminist critique that Judaism is a system of patriarchal domination, including the idea that girls are not to be taught sacred lore in the same way as boys, Raisel, an orphan, grows up in the home of her grandfather, a Judaic scholar, who teaches her Torah and Talmud. ""Get thyself at once to Amazon.com and buy this book."" It is endearing and heartwarming.Rabbi Fred V. Davidow"
4,More than meets the eye,"Not a bad collection of all 98 Transformers episodes, but I feel it should have more. The episodes themselves are worth the effort to get this set, but extras are a little short in my view. After season two, the animated film came out, and afterwards the whole Transformers series changed drastically, so much so that it doesn't even feel like the same series. Some characters died in the film, and never returned, and I feel the movie should have been part of this collection. That would make sense for those who have not seen it, and it doesn't help that its out of print on DVD and hard to find at a reasonable price(in most cases it cost more than this set does). The old TV commercials is a nice addition but parts of the frame are blurred out."
2,Broke almost instantly,"We had this machine for a week and than had to return it. The cappuccino jet frother just stopped working. It would produce steam but not foam. It was ok while it worked so I'm giving it two stars instead of one.Other cons to consider:- instruction manual is horrible- espresso is very weak; our Krups steam espresso maker made much stronger coffeePros:- relatively easy to operate, once you decipher the manual- nice cremaAll in all I would NOT buy this machine again. Going from a steam to a pump espresso maker, DeLonghi BAR32 was a big disappointment."
2,Product doesn't last!!!,"When the juicer is working, it does make great juice. We are on our second juicer is less than two years. The first juicer the piece that the blade screws on broke, once that breaks you are done. Went out and bought another juicer that night and not even a year later the same piece broke on our second machine. Very frustrating because everything is made of plastic. Have to screw on blade tightly for top of juicer to fit properly. Love the concept of juicing fresh fruit, but won't buy another Jake Lalanne juicer, not worth the time or money!!"
4,Good and inexpensive,I am using the with my epson 8350 projector. It is working well so far. Assembly was simple mounting was not to bad. The good is that it is very adjustable. The con is that there is no fine adjustment. Basically it is easy to get it in the ball park but if you are expecting to be able to adjust the mount a millimeter you should go for a high end model. It works well for me and would not hesitate to suggest to anyone doing a budget install.
1,cheesy,"This is the cheesiest item I have ever been duped into purchasing; in retrospect, I should have known better. Extremely lightweight all-plastic construction insures a short useful life. I followed the instructions to the letter, and my CD still skips. The only positive aspect of the initial use is that one of the airweight plastic fittings broke, which means that I can throw it in the garbage where it belongs, since it's hardly worth the time and effort to return. A complete and utter waste of time, resources, and energy!"
4,Good Set for occasional use,"I purchased this set primarily for the screw extractor tool included in the set. The set is nice and light weight and works well for mini screw drivers that you would use once in a while. I would not recommend this set if you were to use it on a regular basis, as the grips are a little narrow for this. Also the heads may be too short for some deeply set screws. The clips also get in the way, but these can be removed.As for the screw extractor, when I first saw it I thought there was no way it would work. But with little effort I was able to extract a screw from my laptop (that came factory striped by Foxconn) that had no thread left to grip too. In addition, that screw was in there tight, but the extractor had no problem griping the gnarled screw head.I would recommend this for anyone looking for a compact screw extractor for small electronics."
4,Glad to see it again!,"I was happy to see the most exciting scenes of the movie again. I liked the initial response of the aliens with a sonic boom! The theory is old, communicating evil intent telepathically. I liked the alien ordnance that looked like pegs from the actual game. I would recommend it!"
1,mavpcc,"I coach youth track in texas and purchased this starting block for Middle school and high school athletes. It is very narrow and not very sturdy, so it limits the runners ability to really explode from the blocks with any sort of power. I would reccommend spending a little more and get a olympic style block. I purchased another block. This one just sits in the garage."
2,Lots of tidbits,"I got this hoping it would have the big picture of the layout of the city and the must see information as well as the off the beaten track info. The video is lots of 3 minute snapshots of cool ""unusual"" things to do in Barcelona. As the other reviewer points out, the lack of ""play all"" is a drag. You have to navigate through the menus way too much.If you already know about Barcelona and want insights about where to go outside of the typical tourist areas then grab this video. If you want an overview of the city and its highlights look elsewhere."
1,"Useful for ""titled"" readers. Useless for the rest of us.","I purchased this book and wish I hadn't. As a genealogical source for individuals searching their roots it is almost worthless. It is really a ""Who's Who"" of living title holders with specific and narrow info on their lineal descents. The individuals who appear in it are of families who already know their ancestry, and who in fact provide the data. This book contains virtually no useful information for collateral branches of titled families, which means that if you don't possess a hereditary title it will be very difficult or impossible to learn anything useful. If you're researching living title holders, it may be useful. If you're looking for your own roots, you'll probably be better off finding this in a library than paying for it."
1,Confused by link,I was led to this productMaverick ET-8 Electronic Thermometer and Timerthrough a site that lists products Made in USA. It was after receiving the Maverick ET-8 Thermometer and Timer with its Made in China on the packaging that I re-read the general info on the Made in USA site and learned that there are still products included that are NOT made in USA. I would like to see where each product is manufactured as part of the standard listing information on all sites.
3,Too Big for many,"This is a big watch.. Really big. Looks fine, but you need a big wrist for it to look right. If not, it will look like a make believe watch on a child.Works fine, but its just too darn big for many people."
2,Don't waste your money on the hardback like I did.,"Janey Wilcox, main character of one of the four short stories, inspires absolutely no sympathy. The only thing that interested me about her was why she was as money-hungry as she was and why she wasn't looking for love. The rest of the stories are way below my expectations as compared to Sex in the City. The story of the journalists was uninteresting and not very plausible. I skimmed the rest of them and they were similarly boring. If you must read this book, first, don't buy the hardcover, and second, don't say I didn't warn you."
4,They Were Great When at Their Best,"S & D were hardly the best of the British punk bands of the 70s but that doesn't mean they were weakies, either. You haven't lived if you haven't heard ""Cranked Really High"" and ""Where Have All The Boot Boys Gone?"", which rides on the greatest hard rock riff of the 70s."
5,Excellent Product At A Great Price,"I started to buy a similar weather at a local Target store about 25 miles away but this one was a better deal. I've had it about a week and am amazed at how well it works. The atomic clock is extremely accurate! I checked it against a standard time and would you believe that it is good down to a second or less! Also the outdoor temperature tracks right with our local Weather Channel readings. Also the humidity readings are good. Another good feature is the button on top for lighted display-in the middle of the night-press the button and read display and it goes out in about five seconds. Hey, I'm going to order another for gift giving!"
1,"Same Experience as Electronics fan from Chandler, AZ","Buyer Beware!!!! My unit no longer hot syncs either! After getting 3 Refurbished units, one new 500, one new cradle and HOURS on the phone to Palm, I found out there is an electrical static problem with this unit (and most of the other Palm products, except the new one)!!!! There is a ""patch"" that was just written but it is NOT a FIX. I FINALLY got a great technician (at the corporate office) that explained that the only way to fix it was to get a serial port cradle....."
5,Good,"I think people judge this film the wrong way.This ain't Citizen Kane or Pulp Fiction, but it does what it says on the tinIt's good, family entertainment. The Duo of Charlie and Lewis is brilliant, and comical, and Estella Warren is both a great actress and gorgeous :PDefinitely and good friday night and also a real good feel good movieGreat fun, pick it up."
3,"""Curtis"" was much better","I bought this CD with high expectations - figuring it was going to be better (or at least equal) to the excellent album ""Curtis"". So far, I'm disappointed. There are too many ""lovey-dovey"" songs with female singers in them, which are about relationships and sexual themes. I don't like those types of songs on rap records. So far my only favorite song on the record is ""Crime Wave"", with a nice beat and an otherwise decent song. Maybe as I listen to it more I'll warm up to it more but so far I'm not terribly impressed.If you're expecting something as good or better than Curtis was, you'll be disappointed."
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"THIS IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED. IT'S LISTED AS A MULTI-DISC COLLECTION OF MUSIC FROM VARIOUS ARTISTS. WHAT IT REALLY TURNS OUT TO BE IS A GROUP CALLED ""THE HIT CREW"" DOING THEIR VERSIONS OF THE SONGS WE'VE ALL GROWN TO LOVE. I WAS VERY HURT AND PISSED OFF! I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BY THE CHEAP PRICE THAT IT WAS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE."
3,Next time I'll Spend more.,"This is on of those cases where you get what you pay for. First, the tripod was missing a screw that holds one of the legs on, pretty easy to fond a replacement and fix it but annoying that I have to. Secondly, it's not a horrible product considering the price, but it does make me wish I had spent more to get a nicer one. My two main complaints are that the level on the leg is far from accurate and overall its fairly flimsy. The flimsy part bothers me the most because I feel like it is not going to provide a steady shot like a tripod should."
5,It does the job,"I've had my converter for a year now, with no problems. For one thing, all converters are heavy....they are transformers. You should see the step-up transformer I have now to convert 110 to 220 !! I bought my recoton before I ever had the chance to read the reviews, or I may never have bought it in the first place. I did not get a dud like other buyers. It does the job. Just remember to watch the wattage settings for the device you are using. If not, you'll fry one thing or another. Usually the more expensive one."
1,Baloney with a smile is still just baloney!,"Every 500 years a technology revolution? Henry Ford innovating generation vs. Bob Hope civic-minded generation? What am I, the Kurt Cobain cocaine generation? Give me a break. Dent practically salivates over his own worked-up extrapolations. Poorly written, with some of the most bizarre graphics I have ever seen, this book isn't worth the paper it's printed on. Save you 15 bucks for a couple of e-trades..."
5,"""I LOVE IT LOUD""","This Album Is A No Holds Barred Back To Form, It's Kiss At There Heaviest Most Darkest Hour. Although, The Songs Required Help From Some Friends, Kiss End Up With An Album That In My View Blows Away Anything They Had Down Before Or After. Also, Something That I Must Shine On Is Eric Carr's Drumming...It Is Immensely Loud, Dark, And Intense...I've Never Heard Drums Stick Out On An Album As Much As They Do Here, and Let Me Tell You The Drums Are Amazing Here, They Prove Just How Underrated Eric Carr Was. Creatures Of The Night, Is Kiss's Finest Hour."
1,CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS,"I WROTE 3 WEEKS AGO ON THE UNIT ITSELF. IF YOU HAVE ONLY 1 SQUARE FOOT OF GRASS TO TRIM ITS FINE. OTHERWISE IT IS USELESS. HOWEVER NOW THE PROBLEM IS TO GET CREDIT FOR THE RETURN. THEY HAVE JERKED MY CHAIN FOR 3 WEEKS SAYING ITS IN THE MAIL. IF THAT IS NOT BAD ENOUGH THEY NOW HAVE CHARGED MY C/CARD FOR THE NEXT PAYMENT. NOW THEY HAVE THE RETURNED TOOLS AS WELL AS MY MONEY. THANK GOD FOR AM/EX. I CALLED THEM AND THEY ARE GOING TO PULL THE MONEY BACK AND I WILL RECEIVE THE PROPER CREDIT.A LITTLE FOOTNOTE...IT COST ME OVER $25.00 TO SEND THIS JUNK BACK AND OF COURSE THATS MY NICKEL, NOT THEIRS..BEWARE..."
4,Good Speakers...Great Price!,"I got these speakers as a gift. I have a sort of frankenstein sound system (no matching brands) and I like sony products for the most part. These speakers are hooked up to a 30 year old amp/receiver and they sound great! I can't imagine how they might sound if used with a proper unit. I'm not setting up a sound studio or an elaborate homme theater experience so these speakers fit my purpose. I gave them four stars because I wish they had mounting points for speaker stands in case I wanted to change it up a bit and the wire provided only gives you about four feet per speaker. I don't know who thinks that is a perfect length...maybe if you live in a walk-in closet. Besides those two minor issues, they are a great buy!"
1,"Another lousy book by a ""smart"" theologian","Written by someone who thinks he knows better than 2000 years of theology. I verified the heresies denounced by a previous review dated March 27, 2003. Well, it's your money and you're free to waste it ;-)"
4,"Blues By Roosevelt ""The Honeydripper"" Sykes","Approximately 39 min. Digitally remastered. This is a prime example of blues shouter Roosevelt Sykes in all his glory. Recorded in 1961,not much else is known about the session. Interestingly,this album was produced by Memphis Slim,who also recorded for Folkways Records. Sykes is in fine form with his powerful vocal style and his always lively piano work. The tracks are paced very nicely and of course it wouldn't be a Sykes recording session without an instrumental (R.S.Stomp) to really liven things up. There is probably no other blues singer-piano player who seemed to put out so much electricity in everything he recorded,and this is no exception. Even old work-horses like Sweet Old Chicago or 44 Blues get the ""Honeydripper"" treatment. If you are looking for an example of post-war blues by a solo singer-piano player-look no further. This is the real deal."
1,"Good idea, bad implementation","This is a far cry from KA's best work. The first two books in this series (Gamearth and Gameplay) are downright bad. The third shows definite improvement in his writing ability, but overall, the series probably isn't worth your time, unless you're a complete D&D addict."
4,"Great story, possibly best war time book","The possiblity that this actually happened adds to the effect, great characterisation, mix of backgrounds - wonderfull read, pity most of his other books seem to be rushed formulaic thrillers."
5,It's so hard to find jazz lovers these days...,"When you listen to music like this, it defines the true meaning of Beauty. One who enjoys nature and is open-minded, would expose themselves to such beauty. Paul Hardcastle has been another inspiration in my life, because he plays so peacefully and romantically. Helen Rogers proves this from her unique vocals. How delicious things songs are: Shine, Feel the breeze, Lost Summer, Paradise Cove and (Lost in Space) speaks for itself. I just wonder why Paul didn't include Blue Days and Summer Rain. Well, one thing for sure, you won't be seeing George Washington's face in the garbage after making your purchase. So, you might as well relax, and let the smooth sounds of Paul Hardcastle take you away...P.S: Imagine what the world would be like if everybody listened to these kind of songs and at the same time enjoyed them... I would suppose Peace On Earth..."
5,Excellant series a must read for anyone interested in Isreal,"I would highly recommend that you purchase all five books in the series at the same time. I read the first one and was hooked. Each book ends as a cliff hanger for the next one. They are historically accurate, and you feel you are living through the struggle of the people of God to establish a homeland. As a non Jewish reader, I learned a great deal and would highly recommend this series."
1,Mall Punk Veterans Get Old & Complain,"Why is it that when white suburban kids get a pop-band together, whether it's Mall Punk, Nu Metal, or Rap Rock, they inevitably make whining albums about how rough life is. Shut up and play, you little sissies. Blink 182 have seen their album sales decrease with every new album release, so they felt it was time to ""mature."" To Blink, maturity means whine and complain over now cliche ""Mall Punk"" guitars. I suppose if you are 14 years old and yer grounded for a week, this might be a decent enough, parent-friendly album. Wait, they have tattoos and lip piercings, so their music MUST be pretty tough, right? HA!The only reason that the world shouldnt burn every copy of this album in existence is that Robert Smith of the Cure is on it. Robert Smith is God! Go buy the Cure's Disintigration LP instead!!!!"
4,Review Time,"I read Ransom, by Lois Duncan. The setting took place high in the mountains in a cabin. The main characters are Bruce, Dexter, Glenn, Jesse and Marianne. The book starts out as all five students are riding home from school on the bus, and the bus driver takes a wrong turn, he says that he's going to pick up a friend. A man in dark clothing gets on the bus, he has a gun and forces them to come with him to the cabin which he lives in high in the mountains. There they are held ransom, until each of their parents can pay the money that is asked of them. I liked the book, a lot because it was very suspenseful and had a lot of action in it. I recommend for people that like suspense."
5,The Best Album Ever!!,"Savage Garden's most recent album, Affirmation, has to be the best album I have ever heard (and I have heard a lot!). Their music is just astounding. The words are so emotionally moving, and when they are put together with beautiful harmonies, the product is just too amazing for words. The Australian duo, which consists of singer/songwriter Darren Hayes and instrumentalist Daniel Jones, write their own music, which shows a huge amount of talent. Not to mention that Darren's aching falsetto is SO amazingly beautiful and Daniel is very talented at playing whatever instrument is needed. Whether you liked their self-titled debut album or not, you will undoubtedly love this one. I would rate this 100 stars if I could, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone and everyone."
3,A curiosity,"Although this film has some curious similarities with the real life of 2 of its major actors ( Harrison and Palmer ) it's not really good enough to merit serious attention otherwise. The plot is very B movie and melodramatic and the acting by modern standards pretty wooden. The true relationship between Harrison and his lover is fatally never fully described, though this is more the fault of prevailing social censorship than anything, with the consequence that Palmer's dogged devotion to her husband appears merely conventional. A pity because there was the chance of a really good movie here. A case for a remake?"
4,FIFA 2004 steps it up...,"After being glued to the TV with Fifa 2003, it was a strange switch to Fifa 2004, at first. The day I bought the game I wanted to return it immediately. The game play was slow, the players seemed immobile and scoring was not easy. In 2003 I would play World Class at the highest speed and win with ease, but not 2004. But after playing a bit the game does speed up and becomes much smoother to play. The graphics are outstanding, the Off the Ball Control is a great asset and it has now taken the place of Fifa 2003 on my shelf. It is dificult to play at first, but once you work with it the possibilities seem endless. The downfall: 1 on 1's. The right toggle stick does perform a move, but rarely works to get past a defender. Oh well, pass around em, right? Anyways its a great game and you should have it no doubt."
4,Like,"I enjoyed reading this and other books written by the author. I also have the CD. Informing,thought provoking and thoughtful too. Thank you."
2,"If you believe people have an eternal soul, this book is not for you.","If you believe people have an eternal soul, this book is not for you. If you believe death is the end physically and spiritually, and you want your child to believe that, maybe you will like this book. I found it not comforting at all, and not what I want my child to believe."
2,OK Book for Practice Tests; no review,"This A.P. preparation book is not the best book I've ever seen. Unfortunately, I only purchased this book as a sole review shortly before the test and was disappointed. The practice tests in the back are great and there are four full example tests, therefore, I must give them some credit. Overall, would not recommend this book as a primary resource for studying."
1,slightly better than the owners manual- good 4 beginners,"I had hoped that this book would demystify such digital details as sizing photos for special uses and serve as a good ""how to source"". I use my pictures in Adode Premiere, web pages, iPhoto, and for email and each requires different aspect ratio, resolution and size. The book covers these issues in general but fails to supply the details of how to change them or why.I returned this book."
4,Quality product makes good use of blind corner,"I purchased theKV Rotary Recycling Center With Out Door Hardware Whiteabout two months ago. I'm very happy with it. This unit makes great use of a difficult space to utilize in the kitchen - a blind corner cabinet. It is extremely convenient to have a 3-bin recycling center in the kitchen. It has saved me countless trips to my outdoor recycling bin.Overall the unit has proved to be very sturdy and holds as much weight as you could possibly put into it. The bins are easy to take in and out for emptying.My only minor complaint is that it did not explain how to shorten up the post (cut it) to fit your cabinet properly. With a little simple measuring though, I figured it out. Just make sure that you don't cut too much off! Measure twice, cut once."
3,Funny....very funny,"It may be odd to hear, but Joe Pesci, known wiseguy in his roles in Raging Bull, Casino, and Goodfellas can also sing. The first cut is the funniest thing I have ever heard. ""Take your love and shove it up your big fat..."" It is worth buying just to listen to cut after cut of Joe Pesci, singing."
5,The Next Few Hits...,"...Greatest Hits Vol 1 had all of the most popular songs that Elton ever sang. This is Vol 2 and it goes a bit deeper into his vast musical history. Some songs may not be known by anyone who is a casual listener. Whether you know these songs or not, this is an excellent disc. You gotta hear Elton's fast paced cover of The Beatles' ""Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds"". Other highlights are ""Levon"" and ""Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word"". If you got Vol 1, don't stop now!"
4,PC on TV,"This product is one of the best I've ever used before. It gives a sharp, crisp quality that looks just as good as dvd. It is better than some of the other pc to tv cables i've used. I would recommend this to anyone who would rather put their computer's visuals on a big tv rather than a smaller more expensive moniter."
5,Cold Rocks Again,This CD is great...they have some really rockin' songs but they also have some mellow ones...stupid girl is a really great song.This CD is good from beginning to end. Cold Rocks...peace out.oh yeah...this has nothing to do w/it but get Good Charlotte. They rock!k/r gc
4,If you like the X-Files...,"If you like the X-Files you will enjoy this book. More a mystery with sinister biochemistry overtones than sci-fi, it gives you the creeps and ultimately leaves things unresolved. Our fearless FBI guy keeps trying to make the pieces fit. It takes 6 months and a lot of coincidences, but finally it all comes together. I found this an exciting read with lots of page turning suspense. The lingering meanace at the end made the premise more credible. And my hat goes off to anyone who can set a story in Newark, NJ.I am a Nancy Kress fan and have read several of her books including the Beggars series. This is quite different, no really awesome science or brave new future world. A good read for someone just starting out in science fiction and not wanting too much sci-tech."
4,Excellent Workout,This is an excellent workout. I feel completely worked out when i'm done with just the first one which is the low-intensity workout. I cant wait to move on to the others. Its great also because they lost the weight doing these workouts at least thats how i feel about it. Its completely worth the money to me. Bob is funny and the people are great. I definitly recommend this dvd.
1,Rambling...,No meat. Not a lot of depth. Just words and rambling. A big disappointment. This seems to be just words slapped on pages and put up for sale by a publisher maybe out of obligation?Not really an inspiration for those of us who have not come to terms with being a father.J
4,"Great Show, So-So DVD","I love ""Murder, She Wrote."" It takes some major clever writing to come up with a one hour whodunnit for each episode, and still be challenging and entertaining, but this show managed to do it for 12 seasons. Angela Lansbury is completely delightful and its fun watching a parade of guest stars from various TV shows involved in the mayhem.The DVD's, however, leave much to be desired. Considering how beloved this show was during its TV run, you would think Universal would have provided some extras. Instead, we get the annoying new double sided disc treatment (careful of fingerprints!) and nothing extra; an example of a cheaply done DVD release for a major series. Certainly worth getting--the episodes alone are wonderful entertainment--but lets hope season 2 sees something extra for the legion of fans of this great show."
5,One of the greatest albums of all time,"This album combines not only great guitar riffs, but truly shows that Billy Crogan is one of the greatest musicians of all time. From the first song titled appropriately, ""I Am One"" to the beautiful song ""Window Paine"". This album is the best album to combine complete edge and beauty since Jimi Hendrix's Electric Ladyland."
2,"Read them all, kind of wish I didn't","The writing in this book and the books that follow is bland, redundant, and often times silly. While I can't argue with the authors' view of biblical prophecy, I can't wholey agree with it either. It is difficult for one to believe that good people can't get into heaven just because they are good, and that God would forsake all who do not call Jesus ""Lord"". It can also be quite disturbing to read literature that claims Christianity is the only hope for mankind and that all other religions are false. I say good for Tim and Jerry for taking a stand and not making a wishy washy, P.C. book for the masses to swallow. Work on the writing skills, but keep your stance. Tell the truth that everyone will eventually learn, whether they believe it or not."
5,Five stars,This necklace came very nicely priced and has a very sturdy chord. Coming from someone who takes necklaces on and off all the time I get really sick of chords/chains breaking. That and it also looks very nice. :3
5,"Surefire G2 - affordable, strong, like a spot light in your pocket",I picked one of these up recently and am very pleased with it. No one can believe how bright it is. I was able to try out several lights when I got this one and no other could compare. The more expensive streamlight scorpion cost more and was noticably dimmer and the beam was not at all full like this Surefire G2. I plan to keep this one in my pocket and buy a surefire C3 next for the house. This light is excellent for the money - you won't be disappointed.
4,Excellent Printer,"The B9180 printer has proven excellent in printing repro digital prints of my oil paintings and pastels. I'm using Hahnemuhle art paper and the color is extraordinary. Using it with Photoshop, I hardly ever have to correct the colors, so I haven't wasted a lot of high end paper. Your investment will turn out to be more in the ink and paper you buy than the printer itself. I chose it over the Canon because Canon prints a wide border on the paper, and I wanted to have more flexibility with that. I can print without a border, and get buy with smaller sizes of that excellent but very expensive paper."
3,Fever 1793.,I give this book a 3 stars because there were about 3 exciting parts in it. This book {Fever 1793}is about a girl named Matilda. Matilda is trying to battle yellow fever and find her mother at the same time. I would not recommend this book because it was very dull and boring. I did like how well the author painted a clear picture in my mind of what was going on.
1,Beatles Celebration,Garbage-- don't waste your money on this one lads. The only yucks out of this video were those provided by the narrator's phony British accent. Might I recommend Yellow Sub if your in the mood for a little of the Fab Four.
5,Not Just For Bird Owners!,"I picked up this book because of its dazzling cover and started thumbing through it. I'm an animal lover, but I've not lived with a bird since I was in grade school. Nevertheless, I was enchanted. This little - small format, only 149 pages - book caught my attention and held it so tightly that I bought it!It's a quick read for ANY animal lover...even one who loves only the human animal. I bet you'll learn a lot about relating to all creatures great and small!"
1,Non Responsive Seller - WATCH OUT,"Enjoyed the watch for few months. Very light watch and perfect for day to day use. However, the prong of the buckle broke in half. I was very much surprised for a Swatch to do that. I called Swatch customer service and they told us that I should contact the seller. First of all the seller does not have a direct number. They tell us to leave a message. We left many messages and yet to receive a call back. Very much disappointed in the seller. WATCH OUT. SELLER DOES NOT RESPOND AFTER THE PRODUCT IS SOLD."
1,Customer Service,"The game in itself is entertaining, however it did not come with CD keys, nor can they be found on the CD's, they are necessary to play in the multiplayer mode. I have written various emails to Ascaron, the makers of the game, in order to solve the problem, however help and/or solutions have been non-existent. Reccomendation: If you want to play multiplayer, look for a different game."
2,left me uneasy...,"This book was written in an ethnographic style, which left me feeling very uneasy with the American author's obvious cultural hang-ups and assumptions. (I notice that anthropology is not amongst her qualifications.) I would certainly not rely on this book as the last word on the subject of Voodoo, or the places she visits. However despite the ethnocentrism and egocentrism it was still quite an interesting book. It will be interesting to compare it with other books on African spirituality."
4,Slippery Songs,"Slippery When Wet is the album that propelled Jon Bon Jovi and his bandmates from open act to major league headliners. Often they are dismissed as a 80's hair metal band, admittingly there is nothing on this album that will make you forget Springsteen or the Beatles, but it is unfair to lump them in with that genre. Although they had the look down (big hair, torn jeans etc.), unlike the other bands, they actually have a good ear for a melody and wrote good songs. Songs like the number one hits ""You Give Love A Bad Name"" & ""Livin' On A Prayer"" show their diversity. The former is a straight ahead rocker and the latter a moody number. ""Wanted Dead Or Alive"" is a classic rock epic that aspires for greatness. Lesser known songs like ""I'd Die For You"", ""Social Disease"" & ""Raise Your Hands"" are solid songs. The lyrics sometimes fall into tired cliche terrority and the music is a little too slick in places, you have give the band an A for effort and genuiness. The album is just good fun."
3,its ok,My dog likes these treats but not as much as just plain boiled chicken. Saw this at the store picked up a bag there. This also gave him terrible diarrhea first few times he ate this. Good size for training treats. I probably wont be buying any more.
4,Les Miserables...WOW,"I loved this concert! I thought it was fabulous! The voices, and even though it isn't the show that you would see if you saw it on Broadway...the songs are the same! Sung beautifully and with as much passion as if you were in that era! I recommend this to anyone who loves the songs from Les Miserables! Great job! Oh, by the way...if anyone is wondering if Nick Jonas can really sing....Can he ever!!! He did a wonderful job! Awesome!!"
2,Doesn't last long for joggers,"Sound is muffled and poor, but you will get used to it. Good fit in ear. Good noise canceling. I went jogging with these daily for about 2-3 and the right earbud went dead. I'm not sure if it is due to the running, but my experience does agree with previous reviews about running causing the headphones to die. Do not buy if you're a jogger."
2,WHAT? NO LAURA NYRO?,HUH? Laura Nyro is clearly a part of the film's dialogue and sets the mood for integral scenes. I'm glad I knew that her songs had not been included--it saved me some hard earned bucks!
1,_ _ _ _Gel Dispencer,"Pros: Great idea. Easy to use. Easy for travel.Inexpensive.Cons: Does Not Get Hot.Got tired of putting cold lather on my face in the morning (especially in the winter). Thought this would solve that problem. Instructions warn of steam escaping from the unit. Instructions say it heats up in minutes. It gets to it's maximum temp in 12 seconds. It heats up to just above room temp. I thought I bought a bad unit, so I had it exchanged. Same result with new unit.If you are looking for a Hot lather shave, then I suggest you pay for a more expensive product."
1,From Fiction to Final Print: How to Sell Rubbish,"It read like a cheesy suspense novel with cliché after cliché. It would be nice if this blissfully ignorant idea of Satanism (I was amused by the ""coven"" bit) to be God-hating were anywhere near the truth, but to each their own and to myself, a good helping of factuality."
5,A fine textbook,"This is a first-rate text for anyone interested in understanding the exceptional learner from a ""characteristics"" point of view. Case studies and an easy to read format make this a student favorite. The only complaint about the book is the exhorbitant price for a paper-back. Few are available used, because it is a wonderful refererence."
2,I like your new stuff better than your old stuff,"do you like the latest from emiliana torrini? then don't buy this! rather dated 90's sounding overproduced dance tracks with rather average lyrics. there are a couple of tracks that have withstood the test of time and fashion, but most of this was unbearable to listen to, having recently been enchanted by the last album, and loving fisherman so much. zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"
4,"Very good up to IBM360, Great Bibliograpy, Highly Readable","This book focuses on early machines up to the development of the IBM 360. It covers both the technology and the personalities involved. It contains startling facts such as the Z4 (a mechanical computer) could reorder instructions to improve speed (circa 1948). It outline some of the most brilliant work in computer science. I wish it had more technical detail, however it does have an extensive bibliography. I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in a deep understanding of computers. and where they are going."
5,A WONDERFUL TRADITION,My father always kept his subscription for Readers Digest and it is one of the first magazines I ever read. I love the variety of this mag. There is a little something for everyone.
1,overpriced piece of plastic,"I thought this would at least have a zipper or something to seal it closed but it does not. It is a cheap piece of thin plastic that tore when I used it, you'd be better off using black garbage bags and duct tape, don't spend money on this."
1,Apparently everyone agrees...,"I couldn't believe how bad this book is! My friends and family had to listen to me rant about the poor writing, the strange sentence structure and the boring boring detail - as if the author was compelled to write a certain number of pages per day or else! Robin Cook should just give up writing if this crummy story is the best he can do. I finally gave up when Joanna went on and on about her missing ovary. When it becomes laborious to read a novel - I quit. There isn't enough time in my life to waste on this drivel."
2,... Boring...,"Well, I'm a Linkin Park fan, so I figured I'd be in for a treat when I heard this album... But then I listened to it. Somehow these guest artists manage to take Linkin' Park's best songs, knock the lot of 'em down a few notches in the tempo department, and take out everything that made the music interesting. Essentially, it's Linkin' Park's best work, made dull."
2,Didn't last long,I bought this used and it only lasted for about a month. I will now go to the Apple store and buy a new one which I should have done from the beginning.
5,Real Man S***,I doesn't stink up a room hours after you leave but it is remembered..... I think that's better thank making people choke...
2,Very disappointed,"After reading many good reviews about this product, I decided to purchase the reconditioned model. I was very disappointed when I opened the box... It had many dents along the top of it, the chrome attachment where the wisk attaches to was crooked and could not be straighted out .... and the dough hook and paddle still had batter on it from the previous owner !!!! I did use it however to test it out, and the motor seemed to hesitate a little bit .. Overall, I was not satisfied and this mixer and it is on its way back to the store. I found a more powerful, larger one online and on sale for only a few dollars more with an online coupon .. and brand new... which I ordered... Hopefully it will meet my expectations."
4,Count your blessings,"It's hard to imagine a life as difficult as one lived by Frank McCourt. The religeous commitment, the poverty, the drunkeness, and above all the squalor. I can't remember reading anything historic that recounts what life was really like 50-60 years ago, much less living it."
1,Where's the rest?,"I completely understand works like Milne's Winnie the Pooh, over which there are reprint rights issues, being omited. There is no reason for classic children's works like Montgomery's Anne (of Green Gable and Avonlea) to be missing from a ""complete"" collection when Penguin publishes them individually elsewhere.And as a sidenote, Frankenstein was never intended as a children's book, but was Shelley's novelization of her ethics and philosophy works."
2,Building Linux Clusters,"This is my first attempt at building a cluster, so I bought this book. The book has the potential to be a great starter book, but the text is so poorly edited, it makes for a tough read. Another problem, is that nothing in the installation seems to work exactly as it is supposed to. I take one step, debug, fix. Take another step, debug, fix, etc. Not being a Redhat fan (I use slackware), it is very frustrating to try and fix these problems. I am still trying to get my cluster to run, so can't comment on the rest of the book, but after reading the errata on O'Reilly's web site, it appears there are more software problems awaiting me down the road. The reason I bought this book, instead of just reading HOWTO's, FAQ's, website's, etc. was to have a smoother entry in cluster building, but I am not seeing that benefit with this book."
2,Where has James Patterson gone?,"I've loved James Patterson's books from the beginning, but I think he's spreading himself too thin and it clearly shows in this latest novel. It took me over a week to finish this book because it just didn't hold my attention. I usually can't put his books down and finish them in a day or two. It felt very rushed and without much thought. I hope his next book is better. Seems like he's writing for quantity, not quality."
5,Hands down the best auto racing book I've seen,"I've been around this sport my whole life, and I've eagerly snatched up and read every book on the sport I could find.And out of all of those, this book is without a doubt the best. Curtis Turner had a life that would take 4 Hollywood films to document. It was complex, it was wild, it was, in a word, unbelievable. Edelstein's book was 5 years in the making. It was painstakingly researched, and was very, very well written. Edelstein puts the reader in the race car with Turner, as well as in the seat next to him aboard his Aero Commander, where Curtis was equally as fearless. From the highs, such as his 1956 Southern 500 victory, to the lows, such as the ultimate betrayal of a business partner that lost him his beloved Charlotte Motor Speedway, the book continues to work at a professional, even keel.It's not a book about racing. It's a book about a legend. It was long overdue. Thank you, Mr. Edelstein, for finally bringing Curtis Turner back to life."
4,Haunting,"I saw this movie in 1974 as a double billing with ""Black Christmas"" and both films scared me in a different way. They are both excellent films. OK Vampyres ""Their lips are moist and very very red"" so the caption tells us and it is certainly correct. This remastered edition is excellent UNCUT & UNCENSORED and u won't find any fangs here which I think is why I enjoyed it all the more. Fran and Miriam kill their victims with whatever is at arms reach or mouths reach. The music is subtle the house is creepy (same house used in ""Rocky Horror picture Show"") Watch in the dark late at night."
1,No power,I own a similar product and it works perfectly. I bought one as a Christmas gift in October. After the gift was opened and it didn't work I called the vendor and was told that it was more than 2 months since the purchase (bad idea to do early shopping). Purchased from this vendor to replace non-working gift. This gift worked the same as first gift. Could not suck up a bug or even a piece of paper.
2,Snore..............,"I was expecting a lot from this album after a bit of an abscence from the musical stage. This album did not deliver. The only real good song was the first single ""Scar Tissue"". The other songs are very tedious to listen to. They lost a lot of the hardcore funk they used to have which is brought out a bit in ""Around the World"", but the song is hardly catchy at all. The other singles ""Otherside"" and ""Californication"" are very boring and offer nothing to do with the Red Hot Chili Peppers of the past. And Flea, one of the best bass players ever, fails to even show a glimpse of his talent in any song. If you're going to buy a RHCP Cd, get a different one than this."
4,Good Yoga Workout With Bonus Strength Training,"This is a nice introduction to Yoga. Bethenny emphasizes that this is the type of exercise that she really does and is calmly encouraging. She works with Kristin McGee, who is a solid, non intimidating instructor. I like the banter between the two and the emphasis on modifying if necessary. There is about 40 minutes of yoga, a 10 minute strength training section focused on the arms, and a 5 minute bonus ""booty blast."" With the weights, Bethenny again emphasizes that this is what she really does and it is a good workout without being too crazy. I've used the weight section separately--it's a nice add on to a cardio workout if you also want to do a little toning. Overall, I like this DVD. Bethenny and Krisin present a workout that is good exercise, but that doesn't feel impossible to get through."
1,Beware!,I read some negative reviews on this type of purchase after I had already purchased this battery. Let me say I also found that these batteries although they appear new behave as if they aren't. Mine is only a few weeks old and is already loosing it's charge as fast as my 18 month old one. Probably worth the extra money to buy a new fresh one directly from the cell plan provider.
4,"book in good condition, delivered quickly",fairly old book but was in good condition as advertised. Delivered in a timely manner without problems.
5,Borneo Horns with Lenny Pickett,"My man Lenny,Right on. That is an unbeliveable example of music know how. I really enjoyed it. I only wish that I could play as well as he does. It took me a long time to find this album and I won't let it get away from me.Best wishes to Lenny Pickett and the Saturday Night Band, you guys are the best!Dominick DOnofrio"
2,"When it works, it's great","We have had this toaster about 2 years and in the last 6 months we can't get the control button to stay down all the time. We have to press on it about 6 times before it sticks. The other problem is once you use it about 3 times in a row the control button doesn't want to go down at all. We have to wait several minutes for it to cool down before we can use it again, by that time our breakfast is cold."
1,"Not up to expectations, more like gelatin than chicken","Our dogs love chicken so, after reading all of the positive reviews and noting that the first ingredient was chicken, I was really hopeful that these would be their new favorite treat. They sometimes will play with them for a minute but will not eat them and are not the least bit excited about them. They even lost interest in the sound of the treat jar that normally gets them very excited. These treats feel and look more like a wad of gelatin than chicken and have been relegated to the trash bin. They would be a little on the expensive side if they actually were mostly chicken but they are way overpriced for sort of chicken gel wads.While almost everything ""tastes like chicken"" these treats don't, as evidenced by the fact that our chicken-loving dogs do not like them one bit."
4,A TV SCIFI CLASSIC,I absolutely enjoyed this dvd set. The show hasn't been televised much since 1968 and now is the perfect way to view it! This show was a landmark for scifi television in it's time period of the late 60's. Excellent use of bright colors in it's filming and the transfer to dvd is crisp. I never really got into other Irwin Allen shows as much as The Time Tunnel. I rank it among one of my favorite 60's tv shows along other great shows like The Prisoner and UFO.
4,"Scientifically ridiculous, but utterly entertaining","Bought this dvd on a whim because it was $5 at a store. The series is now my secret indulgence. Scientifically, this series take massive inductive leaps from what is often minimal evidence. (I have only seen seasons 1 and 2, so far) Still they do it in a highly entertaining way, and for some reason, I just can't get enough of this show. It definitely makes you think. My main problem with the series is they introduce a piece of evidence, they introduce the traditionally accepted view and then they introduce the alien theory, when there may be some or many other possible solutions that fit. Still it is a show about Ancient Aliens, and they do put there ideas out there as theories or hypotheses. Overall entertaining, and I enjoy seeing the one guy with the supernatural hair."
5,Jesus Calling Enjoying peace in His Presence,"This book is wonderful. I have it on CD, in my IPOD, a hard copy, and on my nook. Plus I have purchased a copy for a few friends, my sister, mother and nieces, brother in law and step father. It is such an up lifting book.Jesus Calling: Enjoying Peace in His Presence"
2,An orgy of plagiarism,"This is the most plagiaristic album I have ever heard. From the first track (which begins with an [imitation] of Pink Floyd's ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond"") to the last (which ends with two minutes of repetition of a guitar riff from Yes's ""Gates of Delirium"") there is nothing here that wasn't lifted from some art rock album from the 1970's. Buy the originals, not this."
3,More Sound than Fury,"I'm an amateur racer and lover of all things retro, but I can only like ""Grand Prix"" so much.Sure, the opening sequences and surreal closeups are interesting and exciting, but they wear thin well before the end of even the first tape (a two-tape set) and can't carry the lurching, plodding story line. What starts off as seemingly bold artistic experimentation starts looking more like ""Hawaii Five-0"" trailers as the film progresses (rapid zoom-ins, etc).If you've got to have it, confine yourself to the first 30-45 minutes (through the Monaco GP race). If you don't, you may find your other viewers evaporating faster than race gas on hot concrete."
3,Surf section is highly misleading,"This review focuses on the section that drew me toward the book, the surf section (page 151). The author seems to have conducted some research about the names of some breaks but completely overestimated surf heights. For example La Marginal in Arecibo never, EVER reaches 25 feet. And if Los Tubos could reach 25 feet, then I'm 23 feet tall (8 foot maximum surf height seems more appropriate). In fact only a handful of breaks around the island legitimately reach 15ft plus. Make no mistake, surfing around the island can be a bit treacherous, specially for the inexperienced, but the book exaggerates maximum heights two fold sometimes maximum heights are even 3 times smaller than reported here. Just thought I'd mention this for the sake of accuracy. For more accurate descriptions on surf breaks in Puerto Rico, you might want to do some research online (many options)."
3,Works OK,"Slightly flimsy, absolutely must (like another reviewer said) cut potato ends and bottom side that slides against this cutter otherwise it will not work!"
2,This book is based on facts.,"There was a war in Vietnam. That is a provable fact. This book is based on that fact.Beyond that, it's complete drivel regurgitated by paid political hacks. Every single one of Kerry's boatmates and those on nearby boats have backed him 100%.Only sorry losers like the Smearboat Vets who weren't even present during the reported events saw things differently. And most of them have flip-flopped repeatedly on their own versions of events.But if you are a diehard Republican, I'd heartily recommend this book. It should fit right in with your worldview. If you don't have the facts, make crap up."
2,Disappointed Fan,"I couldn't be a bigger fan of Robbie Williams, but this CD was a big let down. First of all, be warned, its full of bad language. My 13 year old son is also a fan and I won't let him listen to this one. Secondly, this is mostly Robbie bragging about himself and his prowess. He just signed a big contract and I think his head is about to explode. He also puts down his fans saying, basically, that he is just using them for what he can get. The melodies are nothing new either. The two stars are for 'Feel' which is a decent, thoughtful song. Sorry, but most people can't relate to the rantings of a British pop star."
1,Terrible DVD Image Transfer,"This D V D's Image transfer from the original film is extremely poor quality. So much so, that is should not be sold by Amazon.com. I returned the d v d."
3,Dispenser,Great concept but wished it came with a clip on for a table to keep it stationary and out of sight.
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"I wasn't sure what I was thinking when I bought these headphones??? Maybe being a BOSE product, I expected an out of body experience or something but that never happened. $300!!! They're not worth that money unless you get excited over a nice fancy case and a few adapters! I've tried many headphones that are MUCH LESS in cost and some of them are just as good as the BOSE. Plus, whoever needed a battery for headphones to work? I find myself forgetting to turn it off and if you don't it will just stay on and when the battery is low, you get all kind of crackling and the power shuts off and on!Don't get me wrong, with a fresh battery, they do sound very good but they are not worth $300!So, SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!"
1,Worthless,"Received the product promptly, however this puller is worthless and I wasted my money.I tried pulling the pulley on my steering pump with it and the pulling assembly simply broke. The metal is of poor quality and bent under torque. The pulley didn't even move!I will try returning it and get my money back."
4,Woulda made a great single album,"Some great songs here ""I Want You,"" ""Just Like a Woman,"" ""Rainy day Women,"" and ""Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again,"" some good ones ""Absolutely Sweet Marie,"" and ""Leopard-Skin Pill-box Hat,"" and some Ok ones ""Visions of Johanna,"" and ""One of Us Must Know."" But one whole side of ""Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands"" is overkill. ""Temporary Like Achilles"" is just a re-write of ""It Takes A lot to Laugh"" from Highway 61, 4th Time Around"" is an unfunny, musically tedious parody of the Beatles ""Norewgian Wood,"" and a couple of songs are just filler, ""Pledging My Time"" and ""Obviously 5 Believers."" This could've been a killer single album. But the best of this is as good as Dylan gets."
3,The prolog about Walter Starr is amazing.,The problem with this guide is it was written in the 30's and the trailhead info is not totally reliable. For hardcore JMT fans this is a must-read.
3,A Case Manager's Study Guide: Preparing for Certification,"Very helpful and well-organized study guide. It has ample preparation material benficial for preparing for the certification exam. Only regret is while title mentions (CD-ROM), the CD-ROM was not included in the shipment I received."
4,Cried and Laughed...Really Liked the Movie!,"I'm not the greatest movie reviewer. I'll be honest about that up front. I tend to watch movies purely for my enjoyment and will usually rate it based on that alone. I rarely judge the acting, the script, the development of plot, etc. I really enjoyed watching this movie because it had ""a little of everything""--something I personally need in a movie. It made me laugh and cry. It had seriousness and lightheartedness. The only disconnect I had was at the beginning of the movie. The plot seemed to make a jump and I was left with a few questions. I wondered if I missed something in the first 20 minutes of the movie. Overall, though, it was a movie that I'd watch again and recommend to my girlfriends. Not sure if it'd be a movie my hubby would watch with me, though."
2,"In responce to the ""elite hacker""","Noticing the so called ""hackers"" word of disgust towards this book, I am left asking myself time and time again, was this book geared towards teaching the average joe to hack? Judging by it's content and brief description I thought not, instead it offers a somewhat quick, realistic view of how companies all across the net are being attacked, and in doing so it offers a somewhat indepth but easy to understand method of securing ones computer."
2,Ho Hum,"This isn't a bad product but it isn't great either, its over priced and under powered for a company that specializes on hair, I expected a little more, the biotin content in minimal."
1,i'm on my 5th replacement machine!!!,"I have had 4 faulty Keurig brewers! They have each said ""prime"" on the screen and Keurig has replaced each one and acknowledged there is a problem. They are sending me my 5th brewer which is an upgrade that I argued for because the other 4 have been so bad. They claim the problem is fixed but you could have fooled me as I'm on my 5th brewer in 8 months! I love how the machine operates and the coffee is really good, I just wish they would fix the flaw. On the upside, the customer services people are very friendly! So, purchase at your own risk, if it works, you will love it!"
2,Spend $20 more and get a tool twice as good.,The only Airy nailer I've used self-destructed after a few months of use. This is a tool designed for very light use in a workshop- and don't ever drop it.The Porter Cable costs only $20 more and gives you a more rugged tool with better support and plenty of spare parts.
2,Unhappy,The headphones did not work. I sent them back to Sony and am still waiting to hear back from them.
5,ONE OF THE BEST,"Really is one of the best electronic albums of the 1990's.You can listen to this from start to finish as many times as you like and never tire of itAs the years go by ""Brace Yourself Jason"" becomes funkier, ""Midwinter Log"" more melodic, ""Catkin And Teasel"" more demented and the title track ""Lunatic Harness"" even funnier.A rare, warm, wickedly funny and FRIENDLY drill n bass album.Makes a perfect pair with Aphex Twin's ""Richard D James"" cd.There's also a collection of ""offcuts"" called ""Brace Yourself"" which is interesting but nowhere near as good as ""Lunatic Harness""If you're new to u-ziq start with this album."
1,Does NOT stay cool,"I bought this to replace a tea kettle that does not have a stay cool handle. The description specifically said that the handle stays cool to the touch. Well, the first time I used it I grabbed it with my bare hand (it said it stays cool!) and guess what? it was HOT. I burned my hand. I am returning this item."
3,"Does Little Debbie offer Rice Crispie Treats? If not, then this is the best product she's dished out!","These are pretty yummy. Nothing extraordinary, and probably more sugar and fat in them then we would like, but they are good.3 stars."
2,Uma saves it from being a total loss,"This film is a complete waste of time, energy and money. On that note the only saving grace is the uberfab Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy. She really camped it up and had a blast toying with the men. The rest are all but a joke. Clooney is ok, but such a let down from Val Kilmer (who really seemed to get it). Chris O'Donnell is good, but relys too much on whining. Alicia Silverstone is just plain fat and ugly. Hello! Batgirl wears a cowl, not an eye mask! Schwarznegger was PATHETIC! The man is not an actor, he is a personality. The whole film was nothing but cheap one-liners and you can pretty much just skip the last 30 minutes (it is ridiculous). The best scene however is the infamous ""gorilla striptease"" with Poison Ivy at the ball. That scene literally had me standing in the aisle clapping with glee!"
5,good grout remover,"This item works well. However, you have to have a steady hand. It really serves its purpose."
2,I Tried,"I really wanted to like this band, but after tons of time listening to this only ""Cold Joint"" and the song after were any good. There is too much great music out there to waste your time on this cold and empty listening experience."
4,"Fun but takes a lot of time, aka your life.",Its a fun game to play with some friends but dont get too hardcore into it because it will take over your life.
4,Nice but a little flimsy,"This is not a baking mold, it is a cake setting ring.It is a great idea to have just one ring, instead of having ten ring of different sizes.Great height for layered cakes. You can adjust it to the desired width. The only problem is that it is a little flimsy, so when I am using it, I am afraid I might bend it. I have used it only once and it worked well. I will keep on using it.I took it to my baking class and showed it to my chef, she thought it was cool, but we're used to use the hard metal non-adjustable ones."
1,THE WORST THING I HAVE EVER READ! TOTAL TURN-OFF,"If you think that an abuduction leading to a flat out rape (no not even heavy seduction here) followed by an extended period of abuse and negligance is romantic, then you will love this book. Personally, it makes me want to wretch. The heroine never fights back. She merely accepts the horrific treatment from the abuser (Oops!) I mean hero Bast-(Oops again!) Brandon. She never even yells! Not to mention that virtually every man, save her brother in law, attempts to rape her. Nice, really. No really. This is exactly what my daydreams are filled with! Please this is disgusting."
2,"Ok, but not great","Got these over a year ago. First the cord is WAY too long, its made for people watching TV from 10 feet way. TOTAL PAIN when walking with the MP3 player. The sound is alright, but the bass is lacking. The cheap plastic connectors wear out so you speaker position won't stay in place if you use very much. They hurt after a hour of wearing. Can't hear outside noises, so thats good."
4,Excellent,"This Kettle is really quiet compared to the last kettle I had which was a Krups, and sounded like a tractor. For the first couple of weeks I found there was a plastic smell when the kettle boiled but it wears off after a while. It looks great."
4,godzilla godzilla!,"concept albums.sometimes the word makes a man run away. sometimes it makes him salivate. whatever the case, HAI is a concept album. it's lush and expiremental and may really dissapoint some people. when i first heard it, i didn't like it. now it's in rotation in my changer at the restaurant i work at almost everyday. it's a good, cool, interesting listen."
2,Beware of Durability!,"I purchased this beautiful pattern to replace my ten year old Mikasa UltraCeram for every day use, as I had grown tired of the Mikasa pattern. I have had the ""Braided Scroll"" for six months now, using it every day, and it has more chips than the Mikasa had in ten years of use. As pretty as this pattern is, it simply doesn't stand up to daily use in the dishwasher. In addition, because it is thicker than many patterns, it is difficult to load in even a newer dishwasher like mine. I purchased only five of the 12 place setting I eventually wanted, but will not be completing the set due to the durability issue."
2,I have tried to like this CD but it is 'Fundamentally' borin,"I have tried to like this CD but it is 'Fundamentally' boring and disappointing. Bonnie Raitt is absolutely one of the best, and I've loved her music for years - roll'in down the road blast'in Bonnie - lots of times, but honestly I can hardly get through this CD. It is just an echo of all her other music (the same intros, the same sound, the same mix) coupled with the imagination of a rock. You hear the same sound here that you've heard time after time, just different words - there is nothing new. She deserves better and so does her audience. I feel ripped off."
1,Motorola MD 480,"I live in Austin, Texas, want to support Motorola as much as possible. Have been pleased with Motorola Star Tac - dropped many times, still works fine. The MD480 is the worst phone I have ever had - worse than the '93 Sony that I was trying to replace. If you love to say it a lot, and your favorite word is ""WHAT"", you will love this phone. Thank goodness for the 30 day warranty. This puppy is going back to the pound!"
3,Down and Way Out,"I saw Mitch at a small venue in Arizona. He came on the stage drinking and by the middle of his act, he was almost passed out on the floor. He lay on his back and could barely hold the microphone to his mouth. He forgot punch lines, lost his train of thought and finally in humiliation begged the audience to not be mad because he was so loaded. What really was interesting though was that his comedy and his drunken state were a great commentary on being a celebrity. I will never forget the funniest, saddest black humor I ever witnessed - it was Mitch Hedberg himself."
4,Quirky but endearing characters make for an appealing read,"April, a lonely teacher with a quiet life, grew up happily in an adoptive family. Shortly after the deaths of her beloved adoptive parents, however, she is contacted by Bernice, a flashy talk show host who claims to be her ""real"" mother. April is not the type of daughter Bernice expected to find, and Bernice is not exactly the birth mother about whom April dreamed for years. Their reunion is frequently funny, sometimes stormy, but ultimately heartwarming; when set against the backdrop of April's budding romance, it makes for a novel which is both humorous and touching. Lipman fans will not be disappointed, and those new to the author may very well go on to read some of her other works as I did."
1,Bright hype big ...,"I too fell for the hype, and even enjoyed the excerpt in the Paris Review, but unfortunately this book epitomizes the notion of overpromise / underdeliver. Some good character ideas, expecially White Mike, but nothing of substance is done with them. The book is written with the subtlety of a bull in a china shop, with none of the many potentials used to any worthwhile measure. While looking for books about adolescent adventures, I tried this, and the next on my list was Trinity Fields, the first two pages of which have thankfully washed Twelve from my memory with its brilliance. Skip this one, and hope that McDonell spends more time developing his inevitable follow-up."
3,MayheM,"Many consider this to be the pinnacle, the epitome, the definite BM release... i disagree, i consider Darkthrone's 'under a...' and 'a blaze...' to be in that category. Anyway back to MayheM, grim and dark, and one of the bands to start the 2nd wave of BM. Blah blah.. my words don't do this any justice, just get the album! :P"
2,A Joke...,"If you don't know much about McCartney/Wings, and only know them for their greatest hits, this package may be for you... For ""us"" 1st generation and serious collectors and Beatles' historians, this package is an insult... Where are the Wings years? Where is that ever elusive Wings' debut party/performance video (which much exist somewhere as we've seen snippets of it in very HQ... Rockshow should have been included in its entirety... One Hand Clapping and/or snippets of it... This could have been as extensive as a 4 to 5 disc set and we would have gladly paid for it... McCartney made the terrible mistake of leaving the project entirely to a third party and giving them free reign as to what to include... I DO have it, only because I'm a completist, but what a BIG dissapointment this was... Two stars is more than it deserves... This was your big chance Macca to leave a great souvenier of your musical travels and greatness... It can still be rectified tho' (hint, hint)..."
2,A Story of no Faith,"The book starts out telling the truth about some Mormon history.As the book progresses he quotes others and their disgust of religion,which many of us hate also hate.The replacement of gods best for us and mans best for us is unacceptable. He then leans on to a tree of knowledge, mans great wisdom. Later his attack on christianity and all those beliefs (except for giving us the modern day calendar) leaves you spinning. At the end of the book HIS truths come forth........they are....no hopes, worthy faiths, nothing except his wisdom and the culture he accepts."
4,heavy made!,Sturdy enough to with stand my 2 yr old and 4 yr old boys. Also easy to clean and very well organized.
4,perfect item arrives instantly!,"I ordered this product for a friend who ALWAYS spills her drinks. Thanks to this mega sipper, I now Queen Spillage by her biological name. I ordered this on Amazon with another product and this product came before the confirmation of the purchase of the other even hit my email. Thanks a bunch!~stephen"
4,A wonderful trip back in time -- with young singers as guides,"This is an amazing album, particularly to one unused to the form or the era. Listening with ""fresh ears,"" untainted by more traditional recordings of the works, I was astonished at the ability of the singers to create wonderful harmonies, soothing transitions, and yet articulate the words so clearly that they could be understood. The music itself transcends its time and space, and can speak to us now. The performances were superb."
1,Broke after 1 year,"I must say, I loved this vacuum when I first purchased it. It was a little heavy, but it had excellent suction. If I had reviewed it when I first purchased it, I would have given it 4 or 5 stars... Over time, it lost suction. About a week ago, the hose came apart from the handle and wouldn't stay in, so I kept having to push it back in. This morning I tried to turn it on, and now it won't work at all... I checked a couple different outlets, but it wasn't an outlet problem, it's the vacuum. It comes with a one year warranty, but that ran out about 2 weeks ago. Very frustrating! Money down the drain. For this amount of money, a vacuum should last longer than 1 year."
4,Nice entertainment,"I saw the movie just last nigth and I think it was good entertainment even though I wouldn't watch that movie with someone without being emarassed from time to time.The acting was ok, the plot rather simple and predictible.I may watch it again."
2,AOL?,"Cornwell writes light books that are best read ""books on tape"" style. I like them, they are what they are. She seems to know a lot about forensic medicine, but not much else. Only in her books would Smith and Wesson make a seven shot revolver or an educated person (let alone an entire self respecting health department) use AOL. Outside of these little flights of fancy, it's a cool little book."
2,Just not Enough to pass the exam,"The exam is heavily concentrated on DNS. In addition, the book is oriented on how to do the basic administration of Server 2003. The questions on the exam are much more difficult than the material presented in the book. The book is good for a general overview of the new product. However, to pass the exam you must really dig into the product with hands on the server. A much better product to use would be the Minasi book for server 2003 plus pulling ever resource from technet on DNS. Neither books covers the detail of DNS that is needed to pass the exam."
3,Not enough Jack until the end,An interesting plodding story.Jack Reacher was very tame. A rather boring proceduaral story. It appeared to be and early Reacher story. I was disapointed
3,The Book of Happiness,"This has been the first time that I ventured in the writtings of Nina Berberova. She has a haunting style and is a skilled narrator. The only problem remains in the heart of the matter, to say: is it interesting what she is narrating? Not to me. Such a masterfulness, what for? I don't find interesting the substance, or better: there is no substance at all. It is vague, ambigüous and nothing more. But, of course that ambigüosness is treated masterfully. So nothing for an Ah! really. You will remember the book for its style and you will not even remember what it was about, because there is nothing to remember really.It is a good lecture for an afternoon in a peaceful summer vacation."
5,Inspirational Truth!,"I just finished reading this book and I have so much more faith in God ! Hagin explains step by step on how to get your prayers answered by God. He also uses his own personal experiences to back up his teachings that will empower you to change the way you are praying. He also describes the different types of prayers and when to use them, such as dedication prayers and praying in agreement. I also liked how he used bible verses and expalined them sraight and to the point!This book is a must read to anyone and everyone who needs help with their prayers and also in their walk with God!This book is empowering, inspiring, and truthful.A must read!"
3,Good Movie not great,"It it worth buying for less than $10. It'll entertain you for the time it is being played. Note, do not buy the DVD version. I accidentally bought the DVD version first and never watched it. Purchased the Blu-Ray and then realized I had already bought the DVD version. The DVD version I have was at such a low bit-rate, I could have swore it was a gray market ripoff (it was a ""used"" DVD with a total DVD image size of 4 GB with the main video being around 2 GB). The Blu-Ray version looks a thousand folds better (I couldn't even watch the DVD version due to the low bit rate of the main video."
1,Don't waste your money like I did!,This is a waste of money. I totally regret buying it. The positive reviews were probably written by the producers of this piece of junk. It's a total ... and I hope you don't get fooled into buying it.
3,Eh...kind of unnecessary.,"If you just adopted a deaf dog, it's nice to know that there are other people who have successfully trained deaf dogs. You'll get that from this book, but otherwise this book is kind of unnessary. There are online resources to get you started with training tips (like getting a deaf dog's attention by flicking the lights). But beyond that, training is just the same as with a hearing dog. I don't want to un-recommend it, but it's just not entirely necessary."
3,"Hard to get into, but likable hero","I had such a hard time getting into this book because I just didn't like the heroine. I began warming to her a little after a couple of hundred pages and couldn't like her until the end. I just had a hard time understanding what a good man like the hero could see in her, especially with the values that she showed early on (titles above all else), with the exception of some charity. And because I didn't like the heroine and couldn't fathom a loving relationship between the two of them, it was a really slow go for me. I found myself bored with their relationship and with the progression of it. That said, I really like Lorraine Heath's books and recommend many of them. This one just wasn't that enjoyable for me."
5,The principled way to build a GREAT enterprise,"While many leaders in businesses fight to be at the top of the heap and at the expense of others, ""Pushing up people"" shows how that you can be principled in business and succeed by being the link that builds others up. I'm glad to have a signed copy. Thanks COACH!!!! GO GO GO! DO IT!"
1,HORRIBLE,"Chips within hours of putting it on. I used it as a topcoat and within a few hours my nails were cracked and chipped. I used it the next day by itself and it chipped within an hour of putting it on. It dries quick and is really thick and shiny, but it chips like crazy and causes polish to chip worse than it would without a top coat. Don't waste your money!"
3,i made a mistake...,"i made a huge mistake with this album, i heard the demos before i heard the finished versions. if anyone else did this then i would think they would probably agree with me when i say that Jerry Finn, as he does with so many other bands, sucked the life out of this album. i like the songs, some of them i love, but none of these versions stack up to the demos, they all sound clinical and passionless in comparison. one large part of this is the damned vocal tuning Jerry Finn seems intent on putting onto EVERYTHING he records, but also it just lacks the soul that you can hear easily enough on 'austere' even. anyway, it is a good album, just don't listen to the demos if anyone offers them to you, otherwise you'll be ruined for this cd."
4,Great Choice for music and photos,"I purchased this 3 months ago and have had excellent results. The battery life isn't as good as advertised but overall, the product is excellent. I use it with Napster To Go and for downloading pictures off of my camera. I especially like the fact that I can download pictures and use as a temporary storage device without having to go through a computer. The built in radio is also very nice. I gave it only 4 stars because of the battery life but would highly recommend it to anyone."
3,I wish I hadn't bought this,My 4 year old loves puzzles and horses but I wish I hadn't bought this. I have younger children who are undoing things behind me so it's a pain that the puzzle isn't put away unless it's completed. The pieces are hard to fit together - the puzzle is listed as being hand crafted but I don't necessarily think that's a good things for puzzles.
3,good outline for class leader,"This is a cross between a commentary and a cliffs notes on Lewis' book. This is one of a series, apparently. Since the actual book ""Mere Christianity"" does not waste a lot of words on fluff, there really is no need for the notes part, but the restating of the themes in different words is helpful. It's a welcome companion especially for anyone leading a discussion class. Very inexpensive and brief. A helpful preview and review to each chapter as we read. Well worth the tiny price."
3,Not as bad as people say,"This is not SW best album by no way but it seems like a reflective album that it takes some time to get into. i think after a few listens you'll undertsand what Ben weasel was trying to do. best songs:"" acknowledge"", ""sidewalk warrior"", ""static"" and ""bark like a dog"""
2,Expensive,"Small and expensive: I had to buy this to meet Amazon's $25 free shipping. I was in a hurry and it's my fault that I didn't look closely at its description on the site; I just want to get the transaction over with. It does the job it says it will do but if you are only going to use this to clean your eyeglass lenses or your cellphone, you are better off with the ones sold at grocery checkout counters. For your very expensive DSLR, maybe. There are lens cloths that Walmart or Target sell in their optical stores that are much cheaper."
4,Very good review and convincing explanation,"If you are not an expert in Electromagnetics and would like to get a broad perspective of the field without going into complex mathematics, this book is the right choice for you. All the explanation is clear and convincing. You will not feel like you are reading a book, but in stead listening to an expert in RF engineer speaking to you. In addition, you will find the references given in separate sub-topics very handy. They leads you directly to the right books when further knowledge in a specific area is required.(Why 4 stars? Some topics can be given and discussed in more detail.)"
3,kids mouse,"I purchased the kidz mouse for my grandson who just turned 3...it was easy to install, I like the fact that I can use my mouse along with his to help him guide it properly...he still has to use two hands, one to click the other to hold it steady...it has a tendency to slide around easily...I think the cord should have been placed in the back of the mouse not the front, it is a bit cumbersom for him to use and he gets a little frustrated...I will not purchase another one..."
5,Perhaps the best show ever...certainly close!,"The writing, the acting, the feeling of being in DC, in the seat of power; it's all here! What a treat. And what a treat to relive this series. I love having these free Prime videos available anytime. I've been using my Kimdle Fire to watch this at night. I can watch from anywhere. It's great!"
3,A bit too tart,"These are ok, but a bit too tart IMO.Not a knock on the product, but amazon vine promised a pack of 12, I only received one bar."
4,What in the name of God???,"The thing that really got to me about this movie, is when they would flip from one scene to another when both groups were involved in ""prayer."" The mormon's way of praying about floored me. Their prayers were so evil, spiteful and full of revenge..and for their leader to say that ""God"" told him what had to be done.....what kind of God do they pray to?This movie was good for my daughter. I have always tried to warn her about some of the evils of the world, and this just chalked up some points on why you don't join a cult."
2,Review of Mason's Retreat by Christopher Tilghman,"I grew up on the Delmarva Peninsula and enjoyed Christopher Tilghman's writing about the Chesapeake Bay, so I was interested in reading Mason's Retreat. However, the book was very sad and depressing. I did something that I rarely do - I did not finish the book because it was so depressing. While I thoroughly enjoyed the description of a sea voyage which happens at the beginning of the book and the descriptions of Chesapeake Bay life, I simply had no interest in reading an unrelentingly depressing novel about a failure of a man who managed to cause amazing suffering to his family and truth be told, everyone around him."
4,Great seller,Really appreciated this seller and his willingness to go above and beyond when I had some installation challenges with my new Mac . Great!
2,Not erotic!,"I came home all excited to try them with my boyfriend , we turned the lights off so they could ""glow"" . . they glowed very little and the words were unreadable. We decided to turn the lights on so we could be able to read them and realized the words were already peeling off. They are not engraved!! Highly disappointed."
2,Fair but not as advertised,"I received a US Mail advertisment for this book. I thought it looked interesting but didn't want to spend the approx. $30 to buy it outright. Very glad I got it used at Amazon. Not as advertised.A lot of mainline medical information. Not much that seemed ""Folk Remedy"" to me. Not recommended."
1,The most backwards approach to multicultural ed. ever!!!,"I have had to use this text for a college course. In reading it, I have been subjected to all sorts of personal prejudices from the authors without any solutions. They have used too many pages voicing their undocumented research in a difficult to read format. The opinions are extreme, with no concrete foundations to back them up. There are constant contradictions in every chapter, sometimes within the same paragraph. This was a waist of college students money!There must be more substancial reading out their on Multicultural Education."
5,This CD is awesome and upbeat.,"I bought this CD a while back. I have listened to it over and over and over. The song ""Jesus Is"" is one of my favorites and ""My God"" gives hope to those who are about to give up. I truly recommend this for everyone on your Christmas list. I can't say enough about this CD. I bought it not having heard a single song on the CD. I have NOT been disappointed AT ALL."
1,This a TV movie,This is a typical Lifetime/Oxygen/ Womans Network kind of movie. Very boring.Thank god it has a twist ending or I would have changed channels.
5,A look back at greatness,"This is a great book about a stellar player. There is a nice mix of biographic material, as well as numerous annotated chess games. There is a lot to be learned from playing through the games of Morphy. Even if you begin to emulate this remarkable player in just the slightest degree, your chess will benefit a great deal. Unless you really dislike chess, you will be hard pressed not to be in awe of his remarkable blindfold demonstrations. This man played better chess as a teenager than I may ever play in my entire lifetime. Grab a coffee, grab a chess board, and most definitely grab this book and treat yourself to some truly enjoyable games."
1,Please,"It's sad what passes for music these days. At least try to listen to something where you can hear actual live instruments, not just synthesizers and indistinguishable washed-out ""vocals."""
3,building block for a much larger story,"This story was well told just a little thin on back ground on the main players , but not bad for going in circle."
1,DISAPPOINTED,Received Roomba broken. Could hear the pieces rattling before I even opened the packaging. The piece that holds in the brushes was broken in several places. Could not believe the lack of quality of plastic used. Based on the lack of quality of the broken piece I chose not to have a replacement sent. Idea is great but until product is better made I will not be purchasing.Was very pleased though with Amazon. Return was arranged promptly and refund was credited to my account promptly as well.
3,Poor Quality,I purchased this item in September and already the stitching from the patchwork in back are coming apart. The briefcase has lots of compartment space and actually a steal for the price.
3,Disagreement,"I purchased this DVD for my husband as a gift because I had seen part of it with a friend and found the section that I listened to pretty hilarious. My husband watched about three-quarters of the DVD and thought that there were some really funny pieces, but overall wasn't too impressed with the humour. He found some of it ""disturbing"" and not so funny."
2,I so wanted to like this book! (but didn't),"I tried, I really did. Like most reviewers, I'm a long-time Clancy fan, so I was anxiously hoping Teeth of the Tiger would be the book that turns around the slump Clancy seems to be in. Unfortunately, it was not to be.The characters are two-dimensional at best, the plotting is lazy, and the writing is tedious and numbing. I'm just flabbergasted this is the same author that put out some of my favorite books: Red Storm Rising, Hunt for Red October, Debt of Honor... Teeth of the Tiger not only feels like it was phoned in by Mr. Clancy, but it was done so on a line with a bad connection.I MAY give Clancy one more chance, but I think I'll try a library copy before I spend the money. My advice: Try Grant Blackwood (The End of Enemies, The Wall of Night, An Echo of War). I've officially put Blackwood ahead of Clancy on my ""must read"" list."
5,"don't think 'W' would be a fan, but i am","Boy Sets Fire has a different style, its not hardcore, emo, punk, rock, but meticulously fuses all of them to create something much more. Very political, these guys have no qualms in voicing their opinions which they do every chance they get. They show their disaprovement with corporate america as well as those currently in power through their powerful lyrics.While this may throw some people off, these political messages certainly do not take away from the amazing listenability. After the Eulogy was just a great record among an amazing collection they've put together. I recommend this to anyone with an open mind and an ear for great music.It would be great if those reading this would pick up a cd rather than burn it, I mean these guys formed the band in my hometown and they like all other non-mainstream bands could use the money unlike the metallicas and dr dre's who whine about music piracy."
1,george adamski,"Be aware of the fake alien cults.I suspect, George Adamski, was apart of some kind of undercover nazi/russian project. I saw one of these ships in dec 31 2009. I've reported my experience to mufon and army core of engineers.(Currently, I have been unable to read his books. I will edit my review with statements from his books; when I read them. Maybe ancient alien theory is possible. But, if the aliens are white; take it with a grain of salt.)"
4,"It's obvious, and sad: Lanier will never publish #3","An 8 is pretty high for me, and means that I literally have been looking for this book or its sequel for over a decade. Dozens of bookstores and libraries, and finally, through the wonders of the Web and amazon.com, I got an out of print copy of Hiero's Journey and the Unforsaken Hiero. I suspect that Mr. Lanier, unfortunately, is no longer with us, which will leave everyone who has enjoyed his wonderful works wondering what might have been. If I am wrong about Mr. Lanier, or the fact that there are no Hiero sequels, please do correct me."
2,Be Discerning,"Best read by an intelligent person who can apply appropriate filtering of the far right content. It's a good diet to try, but I would suggest a trip to the doctor first to be sure you can handle it. Hypoglycemics, beware. This diet requires very careful planning and shopping."
2,Huge Disappointment,"I am a HUGE Toni Braxton fan and had very high expectations for this long overdue album. Man was I disappointed. Contrary to Amazon's review of the album, I find it much too dance oriented and unmelodic. Secrets was a GORGEOUS album, whereas The Heat barely displays beauty. In addition, this album relies far too much on background vocals, by actually pushing them to the point they overpower Toni's gorgeous voice. Spanish Guitar has so much promise, but is ultimately mired by backing vocals that don't match the genre. They sound like they would be more at home on an Osmond Brothers album. Like Mariha Carey, I wish Toni would do a stripped down album with no vocal pyrotechnics or backup singers. Don't waste your money. I give this two stars primarily for what I think are the two ""best"" tracks: ""He Wasn't Man Enough,"" and ""Spanish Guitar."""
1,Terrible and misleading.,The menu screen keeps shaking. The picture quality is terrible with even cable. The hookup connector is very hard to reach. You can figure out that this one is a cheap one at a glance. I'm returning this 30 minutes after receiving it.
5,Very good cutting board,"Over the past few years, I had become frustrated buying wooden cutting boards from various sources, only to have them warp or come apart where the wood strips are glued together. Not this board!I have now had it for just over a year, and except for making sure that there is no water left standing on it and handwashing it with mild soap and air drying it every night, I have not taken much care of it. I know I should oil the board regularly, but I never have had the time to do it. It has held up under my negligience, no warp, no splitting.I cut a lot of vegetables/fruit and the size of the board is perfect for me; something smaller would have been less useful.I definitely recommend this cutting board."
1,Dell Doesn't Care About You Or Your Data,"I bought one of the Dell Handhelds and found that the SD slot did not work after buying three cards to try. I ended up calling Dell Support to help troubleshoot my problem and they told me to perform a ""hard boot"". They failed to tell me that this would wipe all my data on the device and I lost two days worth of information on it. When I found that this was the case and the representative didn't mention that it would wipe it all, I was very frustrated. Worst of all, it didn't fix the problem. When I asked to speak to a supervisor, I was informed that they didn't have one because ""they've all gone home"". As a result, it's been sent back and I'm very happy with my iPaq--and its support. Buy a Compaq, they know that data is important and my calls to support don't get treated as a casualty of doing business."
2,This book is only for The Apprentice Lover.,"I gave this book two stars because the book was a little boring and dragged on in some areas. The best information was in the margins and the quotes not really any of the information in the book. I have read: Carolyn, Bill, and Amy's books and I want to give this one a try.This book is truly for The Apprentice TV lover but if you are looking for business advice this is not the book for you."
5,Love the stork,This is a very nice stuffed animal and my grand-daughter loves it. I got it for her shortly after little brother showed up at her house!
1,Present gone awful,Received as a gift for my three year olds birthday. He was so excited. Loved it! Until he broke out in crazy rashes every where and itched himself so badly it looked like her ran through a thorn bush. Not to mention the thing sheads more than a dog.... There were clumps of hair all over this house... So even after i got ride of the horrible lion ive been cleaning his hair up for several weeks now... Steam cleaner and all....just awful. My son never had an allergy to anything before. Must be a spray they put on the lions hair. His doctor said the rashes were from the lion. However I contacted melissa and doug they were very sorry and said they would send him some free gifts to make up for it. We will see.
5,Terminator 2 Judgement Day,"Bought the Skynet Edition in BluRay. This is just the best Arnold action film ever made. That's what it is, so what else is there to say?Terminator 2: Judgment Day"
5,Best Oahu book!!!!,"We purchased three books as we planned our honeymoon on Oahu. We found all of them to be dry reading and not very helpful. A friend loaned us this book and we loved it! It has great maps, very useful info written in a humorous style, lots of ""back stories"" on places, sites, restaurants, tourist attractions, etc. We are returning to Oahu next year, so I ordered our own copy. I highly recommend it!!!!"
4,Cool gift for sport fans or not..,"I got this for my bf's b-day and he is big sport and espn.com fan. he popped it in his ps3 as soon as he opened it. i actually watch one of the disc with him and even though i'm not a sport fan at all, i admit i enjoyed it myself. it was pretty interesting and my bf really enjoyed it too. he also really like the cap it comes it. i recommend this gift for all men....or women sport fans too."
5,Ethics,"My purchase of Enforcings Ethics couldn't have been better. It was brand NEW!!! I didn't know what to expect, I was surprised."
4,pondmaster pump,Good durable pump. Works well if you have a sufficiently large filter so that you dont have to clean the filter frequently.
4,This rocks!,"Yo this is one of my favourite albums at the moment mainly because of Sink the Pink. Yea I know it ain't the best AC/DC song ever but man it rocks! All the tracks are good and the best part is not all the songs are new which means that the diamonds in the rough of the cruddy albums are in here! Sink the Pink is on of them and shake your foundations. I highly recomend this album for newbies to the band and die-hard fans 'cause its got a nice set of songs. Exept Ride On, don't get me wrong its a good song but its not Bon's best.Ride on Bon Ride On"
3,Not Trap Muzik.... but its a good follow up Album,"I noticed that this cd isn't nearly as good as Trap Muzik, however its T.I. with this variety of producers and rappers on it, its hot to certain extent. Some of the content is recycled as far as lyrics go and even some beats (lil jon's recycled drum set on Stand Up) but its a good rap album."
2,Good - But my son's arm keeps getting stuck!,"I like that the highchair doesn't require assembly. Its easy enough to use, no better no worse than any other highchair. The biggest problem I have is that my son's arm keeps getting stuck between the chair and the top of the legs! I looked into this a bit, and am surprised there is no recall. I'm sure there will be one soon. Wait until they fix this before you buy it."
3,"Nice images, but most 'old' and a lot of interviews","I'll be short here: it's nice the first time, but probably quickly dissapointing for 3 reasons:1) the images are all of the typical 'have seen that a million times already' category2) there is too much interviewing/talking, compared to showing cool images.3) it's a bit shortThere are much better Desertstorm documentaries out there. But unfortunately, they are scarce and most use the images that have been shown over and over...."
1,"Like a Christmas Ornament. Pretty, fragile, and hollow.","This is not worth 12.95 US per month. You will be paying to beta test the patches Funcom writes, as the currently seem not to. Check the boards. Look for the fallout on patch 12.6.The graphics and sound are beyond anything else out there. Support, storyline and content are non existant. Gameplay is repetitive and dull. You can hunt until about 80th level (1 week or so to get to), then you will be doing missions. Until 200th. It's just hunt, level. Do missions for loot, sell, buy new implants/nano/equipment...rinse and repeat.Exploits are legion, most tradeskills do not work...there is no PvP balance.This game is not ready to be called a ""retail release""."
4,Pretty Good,"It was a pretty good book and very imaginative, but I agree with a previous review: it contains alot of false god worshipping and other heathen stuff like that. Of course, it's just a game and all in good fun, right? All I'll say is, you have to decide. I just didn't really look at it too much. It's still a good read, though."
2,Really Didn't Do It For Me,"I'm not sure why, but old school Busta Rhymes just doesn't interest me. His songs are too chaotic and his lyricism is just uninspired. ""Fire"" and ""The Heist"" are decent tracks, but otherwise, this album is instantly forgettable. Maybe I just can't appreciate this style of rapping..."
2,Not for use in the Gym,"Note: I'm writing this for my wife the gym-ratIf you intend to use this only out-doors it's great (if not a bit oddly bulky It records paths and monitors many functions as well as lots of great garmin products. The caveat here is that it has no ability to record how far you have gone if you are running on a treadmill.Had to go back to Polar with the foot pod. Should have researched it's limitations more, sent it back."
2,"great sound, cord too short","I really want to like these headphones. I've had them for about six months and I think the sound quality is great for how much they cost. They're really comfortable, too.But the cord length on these things was definitely designed for someone who is wearing this on an armband or something. This is great, if you are one of those people. Unfortunately I'm not. The cord is so short that I can't have my mp3 player at my waist comfortably. That's kind of ridiculous! It does come with an extension cord, but when you have the extension cord on, it's way too long. A bunch of tangled cord in your pocket is not cool."
3,"Good , but not as helpful as it could be","I am not interested in sending this book back to Amazon as I do enjoy having Yoga positions at my finger tips. It's a good book for people who have never done yoga or would like to try yoga stretches for warm ups - cool downs during exercise. But I didn't find it helpful for what I thought its purpose was - how to combine yoga and walking. I thought possibly there would be more about how to hold yourself while walking, breathing while walking, positions to do with your arms and legs while you are walking. Possibly I should read this again.... hmmm"
4,Very entertaining,Buying this game I knew it wouldn't be the best game ever made but I was very pleased with the purchase.This game is hours of fun and the storyline is simpleIf you want a fun game to just sit down and relax for a weekend this game is the one
4,Good light but uses up battery fast,"These lights are quite nice in that they seem sturdy (for a plastic light) and quite bright. I am giving them four rather than five stars because I find that a full-day of solar charge (and I live in sunny Southern Arizona where right now a full day means 10+hrs of sunlight w/ few or no clouds) only provides battery power for a few hours at night. I purchased two lights and have found the same with both. I have other similar lights from a different manufacturer that are smaller and not as bright but last for several more hours, so I guess it is a tradeoff."
1,Save the planet - Don't buy this film !,"C'mon John Woo, what's that ? The movie opens with a 15 minutes cheesy romance between Agent Hunt (Cruise) and Nyah (Newton), with a lot of slow-mo sequences where the two lovers look at each other in the eyes... Unbearable and absolutly not credible !Then you have the usual fight between the bad-guy-who-wants-to-kill-everyone-and-become-the-richest-man-on-the-planet and the good-guy-who-wants-to-stop-the-bad-guy. And guess what ? In the end, the good guy beats the bad guy ! Been there a 1000 times. Done that. Bought the t-shirt, thank you very much.I thought that the De Palma movie sucked big time but this one is even worse. Where has the magic of the original serie gone ? Poor screenplay. Poor acting.Really can't wait to see MI3, MI4 and MI12 !What an incredible lost of time and money."
4,bosch o2 sensor,This product was perfect fit and works great. I have noticed an improvement in gas mileage and the way my car runs
4,Family Reading for Christmas,"Make some hot chocolate, turn on the tree, gather the kiddies and enjoy this delightful story by Jan Karon. It's a perfect read for Christmas, and sure to become a classic. We're not just talking about Mitford. We're talking about Mitford at CHRISTMAS. Accept this little book for what it is...a delightful Christmas tale designed to bring a smile to your little one's face as well as a feeling of nostalgia for small town living. Pack it away carefully with your ornaments and Christmas angel so that you and your family can enjoy a fireside reading year after year."
5,Fantastic,"One of the best ever! A real classic scent. Makes shaving a real pleasure. I also recommend the round glycerin soap as a pre-shave. It has a great soft citrus scent that blends nicely with the shaving cream. Badger brush recommended!!!!!Musgo's regular bar soap has a fresh and soft herb scent that doesn't ""scare"" the world and rinses clean!Once done I use a no-scent balm or skin moisturizer. No cologne or after shave! I just like the soft classic scent these three leave on!"
3,"An amazing work of literature, but work for the reader too.","I saw a mention of JR as one of the great American novels on Facebook earlier this summer and decided to take the challenge. And what a challenge it is; the mechanism of a nearly all-dialogue and minimal use of punctuation can make it a chore to read, but there are rewards. There are rich descriptions of an educational system gone awry, 1970's New York, and a time when divorces were changing the landscape of American families. I tend to read very quickly and you simply cannot with this book. Take the time and if the mechanisms do not drive you crazy, you will be rewarded - BUT this book is not for everyone, so if it doesn't grab you in the first 50 pages or so, let it go."
5,Awesome,I love ashlee she is my idol she is so awesome and i love how she has her own spin and flavor on her music i love her sister to and i love how they are totally different jessica is beautiful but ashlee has that edge shes so cute and her cd is the best in my colection its not to hard core rock and its not all poppy its perfect you should totally buy this!!!!
1,Zero Stars - Stay well away from this disc!,"Hard core Yes and Chris Squire fans will wax apologetically about the redeeming features of the Squire/Sherwood collaboration. Sorry, there are none! Any honest musical appraisal reveals this is an uninspired, pedestrian and very dated effort. I cannot believe anyone could massage songs for 10 years and arrive at this!Chris Squire is a fine bass player and a much under-rated and under-recorded vocalist, it is such a pity that this `drink coaster' so much devalues his small recording output.`A Fish Out of Water' shines like a beacon!"

1,"Wow, what a deception!","Wow! I guess I got what I paid for. When I saw this item, I was amazed by the ridiculously low price for an ""indestructible blade"". My first impression was, ""Hey, I can use that for a spear point if nothing else"". I read all the details and descriptions. What got me was that they showed the item WITHOUT the packaging. Had they showed it in the package it came in, it would have been very obvious that this was NOT an item I wanted. The wording on the front of the package reads as follows: ""High-Tech Plastic"". The wording on the back of the package reads: ""The safe knife for office, home, garden, and on-the-go!"". And it shows the item being used much as a letter opener.Again, what a deception!"
5,CanoScan 8400f Works!,"I just received my CanoScan 8400f two days ago. After sending back my Konica/Minolta Dimage that was defective, I had to try something diferent. After reading all the reviews on this CanoScan 8400f I said maybe this will be the one!1. I had a little problem on installing, but that was takencare of by the great tech over at Canon USA. Excellent serviceI had, 20 mins total and I was Scanning Away........My 1st picture was a color 4X6 and was 'sharp as a tac'!Now I scanned about 20 Slides, they take a little over a minuteeach when using high resolution. But it's worth it! Very Clear and pretty good color! The only thing I noticed a couple lookeda little darker than the actual slide, but there are lots ofenhancement buttons in ArcSoft Photo Studio & Adobe photo to lighten/contrast & other fun neat stuff.I do like it a lot, that why I gave it 5 stars....."
4,Are you a courageous listener?,"It is remarkable that a woman so obviously talented can exist virtually unnoticed by mainstream urban radio. ""Cookie"" is an ambitious project and worthy of her reputation as one of the premier bassists of any gender. The topics are unique and provocative, and the exploration of those topics are typically unflinching."
4,eclectic electrica,"OBK is definitely the ""musica latina"" version of Depeche Mode (Speak&Spell time period). With haunting-dark vocals, basic bouncy beats and synthpop noise...you'll be sure to like it. There are a lot of wonderful artists/groups in the Latin Pop genre, but not too many go for the full electronic/synth sound. I give these ""dos hombres de Espana"" a lot of credit. Check out the band Moenia as well, if you like the Latin Electric sound!!"
5,The Weight Loss Cure They Don't Want You to Know About,The Weight Loss Cure They Don't Want You to Know AboutThe book it self is a good book just long. - wish I could shorten it or have it to the point faster. But it is good.
4,Revere is still relevant!,"This is a good item. We needed something that can heat water for hot beverage and out old Revere broke after 30 years so we bought Revere again and are not disappointed! Seems to be well made, will write again in 30 years:)"
4,Good price on some good strings,"These strings are from the largest manufacturer of stringed instrument strings, D'Addario. Excellent quality with very good sound. Unique color coding of the ball end grommets to identify where each string is to be installed on your guitar."
5,"Great Price, Great Bag","After scrutinizing practically every camera bag available, I opted for this one, mostly because of the price. Turned out to be a great bag and exactly what I needed! I am currently using a Canon XH-A1 and this bag works perfectly for storage and light travel. Although I don't travel with the camera too much, I have hauled it across the country and around conventions. This bag is nice and lightweight compared to some other camera bags out there and has plenty of room for accessories, tapes, mics, etc. I love that I can rearrange the foam inside to make different compartments if necessary, too."
3,"Readable, not great, 3 stars","A collection of stories (some are more like character sketches) is just not as compelling as a book with one story would be, but the main character is interesting and the book is well-written and not as bleak as it might be. The author likes his protagonist, and you probably will, too, an ex-con with a strong moral code and no inhibition about expressing it. Made me want to read the author's other books, so it can't be too bad."
4,Each of the 34 stories is a good read for a relaxing evening,"Bertie and Jeeves know just how to take your mind off hypocritical House and Senate impeachment hearings and sexual overkill.THE WORLD OF JEEVES has brisk dialogue, well paced tales of British leisure class misdoings punctuated by the brilliant people skills of the Gentleman's Gentleman who always saves the day. Best if read aloud. I can't wait to start on another volume."
5,Magnificent!,This book shares a lot of valuable lessons in advertising.The tips Ogilvy gives to the reader are timeless and will continueto dominate the advertising world for many years to come.Wise investment for anyone who's looking to improve his marketing.Igor Kheifets[...]
4,Great cheap ram,"I purchased a netbook with only 1gig of ram which is not enough for those small little computers. I purchased this ram installed it in minutes, sped my computer up. Would recommend it as long as it is compatible with you computer."
1,HOW ABOUT ... NO!,"Think tight leather pants ... too much makeup ... and a lead singer that sounds like a weezing asthmatic. In Flames, Hypocrisy, or Gardenian are all wise choices. If you are into darkness ... Dimmu Borgir is your speed. No offense to Exodus fans, but they are so 80's."
3,Light reading,"This is the first in a series of murder mysteries written by Rhys Bowen. Constable Evans is a policeman living and working in North Wales. The author knows this part of the world very well, and writes in the style of Agatha Christie. This book served me very well as light reading while travelling. Rhys Bowen has also written another series of murder mysteries with an Irish heroine by name of Molly Murphy. Both of these series are very well worth while."
3,Desert Sessions volume 9 and 10,This was a gift for my stepson. I guess he is satisfied with it since he asked for it specifically.
4,new jack city,"WOW,this movie was the first part of American Ganster.All the actors played their parts very well."
4,Textbook on Management Decision Making,The book was required for a fast paced MBA course. The case studies are relevant and up to date. The book arrived timely and in good condition.
5,The classic,"The 1st realistic animated fighting ever made. With Kano, Liu Kang, Raiden, J. Cage, Scorpion, Sub-Zero, And Sonya, they're unstoppable. Mortal Kombat Is the Classics!"
5,Extremely satisfied,This book is a lot better than I expected!Great way for a dynamic but overeasy introduction to Japanese.
2,Enjoy it while it lasts!,"I have purchased this item 3 times now. Shame on me! When it works it does the job quite well. The problem is it doesn't work for very long. Either it breaks or the battery dies. Either way, you spend more money on something that has a life expectancy of something less than 6 months with any type of steady use. I would actually pay a little more for it if it was built to last. Look elsewhere or plan to replace 2X a year or more."
4,Good cleanser,"I've had acne for a while, and my skin tends to dry out during the winter. This cleanser got rid of the dry spots without irritating my acne. It cleans and lightly moisturizes. I would recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin."
2,Boring,I know this is supposed to be for people with pelvic pain (which I have) but it was a little too simple for me. I had high hopes but maybe I will like it more if I get worse. Let's hope that never happens.
2,"""The Good Parts""","I purchased this book expecting a pleasurable read. Unfortunately, I didn't get this as a result. Each story is very predictable, the wording (even though the stories are written by different authors), is nearly identical from story to story, and many of the sex acts and situations are very unbelievable. I will be dropping this book at the nearest rummage sale!"
2,Mint Chocolate Chip Michelin Man,"Wish these came as one large filter instead of these. With this kind of filter it looks like the Michelin Man when it is assembled. Also, the filter smelled like mint chocolate chip for about three days of heavy use. If you have severe allergies, you should consider a filter that doesn't smell out of the box."
3,"good filter, bad gasket","The filter appears to be good quality, but the gasket is made of cork. Cork gaskets are much more likely to leak and rot, so I would recommend finding a set with a rubber gasket. I will probably just end up making a gasket with RTV.Also, if you have a 2wd truck you can replace the filter and pan with this filter and a 4wd pan to gain some extra capacity and a deeper sump."
1,A cautionary tale,"The review by the son of the man who died at Burroughs' hand was impressive. It does create one misimpression, that somehow the rule that Chief Justice Bird came up with was somehow aberrational. The idea that only felonies that are inherently dangerous in the abstract was part of CJ Bird's agenda is simply wrong. Almost certainly, that was the rule at common law when United States courts first adopted this doctrine. Further, for those who disagree with judges making law, felony murder two (the doctrine invoked by the prosecutor in Burroughs) is a creation of judges (or at least that most courts have recognized -- in 2009, the state supreme court finally found that the doctrine was somehow part of CA's statutory law. )"
1,why not read the actual book,"let me first say one thing. I AM NOT A MORMON. now that that is out of the way, I must say that this book is not a good reference to truly discover the beliefs of the Mormons. I have often studied the religon, listened to the ""elders"" and read their book. But one thing that I can never understand is why people need to read books such as this to discover the truth of their message. Why not actually read the Book of Mormon? Why not go to their church? I have. But I am still contemplating their message. Books like this only annoy those who are actually looking for truth. Why not go to the source. It is always the best way to go. Do not buy this book for reference. It is terrible!"
5,"An MGB owners ""must have"" manual.","This guide is an overview of the day-to-day things that an average MGB owner needs to be aware of to properly maintain their vehicle. It includes milage checks, and common mishaps of problems and their fixes. An outstanding guide at a great price for all MGB owners."
5,Fun Movie to See,"This is a fun movie for adults and kids that includes little violence, no swearing and no sex! The humor is straight forward. The dogs are cute and they earned their 3000 pounds of dog food doing the movie. The story of a man living in Florida who finds out that he was adopted when his real mother dies and leaves him a bit of an inheritence is well done. The scenery of Alaska actually shows how beautiful Alaska is. Nichelle Nichols does a terrific job of playing Cuba Goodings adopted Mom in a comedic role. Cuba Goodings carries off his part beautifully, his facial expressions throughout the movie intensify the comedy. If you are looking for some fun and humor, I highly recommend this to you and your children!"
2,Have Low Expectations,"HOW I JUDGE A CLASSIC: I don't give extra brownie points to classic books. I ask myself, ""If this book were published today by some unknown author, what would I think of it?"" Perhaps this isn't a fair way to judge a classic, but that's the method I use.PROS OF GREAT EXPECTATIONS:- It has outstanding character development.- It's a story about people and relationships.- Good, authentic dialog.- A nice moral story.CONS:- Painfully slow pacing.- Long-winded writing style, long paragraphs.- Few characters that are that agreeable.CONCLUSION: Have low expectations when you read ""Great Expectations."" Modern books have much faster pacing and are more easy to read. For those who love the classics, they will love this book. I, however, preferred ""A Tale of Two Cities."""
3,Not the best Game,"Ok, don't get me wrong, the game is OK. It's just boring after a while! The graphics are ok but I swear I havn't played it for a year."
4,Disgraced hero seeking redemption,"Disgraced CIA agent Charlie McKenzie had waited years for his former employer to call him and when it happened, Charlie made his employer pay big to bring him out of his mundane existence. Charles is ordered to find a young inexperience Russian female agent and to bring her back with the secrets she has stolen.Accepting the assignment, Charles real motives are to clear his name and to receive the recongnition he truly deserves. If it meant aiding the Russian agent, then so be it.I first noticed Joseph R. Garber through his novel Vertical Run and wondered if Whirl Wind would even come close to the excitement and entertainment of Vertical Run. It has. Whirl Wind is far different, but the story, characters and writing is just as thrilling.The Friday HouseXiiiLost Hours"
1,"Cheap, Not What Was Advertised","I Will Not Be Ordering From This Supplier Anymore. Nor Will I Recomend Their Products. The Products They Advertise And What You Actually Get Are Two Different Things. The Quality Was Very Poor, The Picture Reproduction Was Speckeled With White Dot's. I Guess It's True You Get What You Pay For. I Will Spend The Extra Cash For Quality From Now On !!!"
2,Onmyoji II,i didn't like the dubbed in English. I had seen is in Japanese and the wording in English where not correct.
5,Works like a champ,Works right out of the package. It arrived quickly and safely. No problems. Sounds great and was a value for the price.
5,SILVER RETURNS TO SILVER!,THIS CLOTH GOT ME AWAY FROM THE LIQUID CLEANERS THAT GET VERY MESSY. I HAVE A LOT OF SILVER JEWELRY AND WITH THE LIGUID IT TOOK ANYWHERE FROM 45 minutes TO 1hr & 15minutesAND THE ITEMS SEEM TO COME OUT CLEANER AND BRIGHTER. I RECCOMEND THIS PRODUCT VERY HIGHLY!
5,Impressive documentery,"I was in the US for the first time a few days after Columbine, so I do remember this tragic event well. This documentery tells the story of the families who lost a love one on april 20th 1999. Good to see the families have heeled a bit since Columbine. This documentery is a must have for people who are interest in what happenend at Columbine High School and want to know a little bit more about the 13 people who were killed and their loved ones. Let us hope that tragedies like Columbine won't happen again if you realise the pain these 13 families had to go through."
5,Gainsborough's Vision - An informative read,An extremely good book. I'm not seriously into Art but I saw this book at a friend's house and I was very impressed. - Very interesting and informative
5,"Nothing is all things to all people, but this is close!","This is a combination of lovely presentation, beautiful models (using both male and female verifies the true artistic intent), and great user interface.... There are lots of reviews listed - many people seem to want it to be a replacement for a live human and it can never be. It IS an inspiration, a motivator, a help, and a lovely, soothing method for practice on your own terms. Bravo to the author, photographer, and models..."
3,"Not a bad way to start playing bass, especially if you have no money.","I bought this bass package a few years ago on ebay. It comes with pretty much everything you need to start playing: a bass, a cord, a stand, a strap, etc. The amp was pretty lame, it ended up being a woefully small guitar amp that I soon replaced. The DVD was particularly helpful, and in my opinion the best part of the package. As for the bass itself, it worked fine for the first several months or so. After my extensive use, knobs started falling off, wires came undone, etc. With little knowledge of electronics I was able to fix everything for a while, until I had to take out all the knobs and electronics to keep it working. It still works now, I gave to my friend so he could learn, and it still serves its intended purpose, but not much more. For the price (I paid about 60 bucks plus shipping) it was totally worth it. Expect a bass to learn on, with all the needed accessories."
1,What a mess!,"My steamer worked well for all of 5 mins. The pole went from upright to a 45 degree angle without hanging anything on it and would not straighten out; the defect appeared to be at the connection where the pole screws into the machine. Then within minutes I had water all over my hardwood floors. I had the same problem as other reviewers, the water tank kept leaking. So off to the returns department we went. I guess it steamed well for the five minutes that it worked? Not worth all the mess and hassle of returning it."
2,Where did it go?,"I was fairly happy with this foundation except for 1 issue (and this is a big issue with me) - if you so much as touch anything or anyone with your face while wearing this foundation, it absolutely WILL transfer onto whatever your face has touched. Doesn't matter if you use primer or set it with a hydrating spray, it ALWAYS transfers. Always. I couldn't stand leaving my face on my boyfriend's shirts anymore (not to mention my cell phone, my work phone, my reading glasses, a tissue I used to blow my nose during allergy season, the collar on my coat, my winter hat, etc.) so I had to give it up. And when it transfers onto another surface, it transfers OFF your face leaving a spot without makeup. If you never hug anyone, never touch your own face and never wear clothes with collars that might reach your face, you'll love this stuff. Otherwise, look elsewhere for makeup."
1,Great Player.... one year later,"No, I don't mean to say that the player has been been great for a year. In fact, it's taken a year and three returns to get this player to play correctly.1. When it arrived new it didn't recognize there was a DVD in it2. After it came back from repair it recognized but wouldn't play a DVD3. After it came back again it played the DVD but froze and/or the screen went blank.4. After it came back again it seems to be playing beautifully.Glad I had an old backup Toshiba in the meantime."
5,Sarah Brightman - AMAZING Album,"This is one of the finest albums I own. Her voice comfortably reaches the altissimo octave and blends well with the background music. In my opinion ""Il Mio Cuore Va"" {Italian version of 'titanic'} was WONDERFUL, I think it sounds better in Italian, with this Orchestration and Sarah singing to it, so MOVE OVER CELINE!Great album!"
4,A great project,It works great under California sun. A wonderful hands on project for father and son. The book also tells you how to power it up with a battery. My 6 years old son enjoys it very much.
1,MFKR,"Okay, for the people who haven't been able to hear this CD, DONT BOTHER! This is the worst CD i have ever heard! I have all the other SK CD's, and the rule, but Paul and I think Mick (I could be wrong) are the only ones in this CD that stayed on for the later albums. The lead singer sucks, most of the band sucks, THIS is why they only made 666 copies! The fact that they decited to re-release it sickens me, THIS CD IS FOR COLLECTORS AND FREAKS ONLY!"
3,Makes you dumber,"This movie is stupid, senseless, and actually makes you less intelligent while you watch it. If this does not sound like a bad thing, this is for you. Really, there is no actual star rating you can give, since the bad acting and utter stupidity are its main selling point. So if you have brain cells to spare, enjoy."
3,Everything arrived on time from seller,Everything arrived on time. Like everyone stated the case is cardboard and will rip apart in no time. Don't get it wet.
1,Not what pictured!!!,"I orderd these cups believing I will get the dinosaur ones as pictured, but instead got flower ones. My son is not going to use the flower cups!"
3,Mixed bag,"The transfers seemed fine. The mixed bag is really with the content - AVP was decent (about on level with Alien 4 in my mind (better than Alien 3 but not as good as the first two)). However, AVPR was a terrible movie - I would much rather watch any of the 7 other Alien or Predator movies."
2,not very usable,"The metal used for this color is SO stiff, it is VERY difficult to take on & off and adjust the links. I have seen video of this type of collar and they should ""pinch"" quite easily to take links on & off and to put the color on & off, as in ""just pinch, and the prongs slip right in"" NOT this collar. The metal on this is so thick I had to use heavy duty pliers to try to get the prongs ""pinched"" to be able to even take the collar off & on. I learned that this type of collar should not be slipped over the head, it should open up & be clipped closed."
1,Bomb! Avoid it!,"It couldn't cool an 11x12 room (high ceilings) while a window a/c with half the rated BTUs does ok. Its fan is very, very loud (although not the compressor).GREAT customer support for a ROTTEN product. Avoid it!"
1,Amazon's The Rise and Fall of the Knights Templar: book myth.,"I have tried over a period of 4 months to order this book, and each time the order has been delayed several times. I wouldn't suggest ordering it through this system, unless you have a lot of time to wait for its arrival."
1,I didnt order it in spanish,I don't know how it happened but the movie I thought I purchased was the English version in the picture and also the title was in English. Then I got the Spanish version.
4,an obvious mentor not mentioned!,"Fred! I really liked your book, I gave it to my husband as I really think it will help him to do what you did, what I am doing and what, whom I am sure it both of ours, mentor did---I read your book KNOWING that you have read works by Julia Griggs Havey! She is eDiets motvator and you write too much like her to have not read her works!Your book is GREAT, don't get me wrong. I am sure you are going to help many men....but come on Fred....where did you derive some of your material?!"
1,Worst Movie Ever!!!,"What a waste of money, time and talent. Very ugly stupid movie and why Charlize would choose to do something so ridiculous. Don't waste your time. Horrible movie. Pathetic."
2,Not thorough with air bubbles,The air streams mostly out of one end and doesn't make it all the way to the other end. Manufacturing defect it looks like. I was disappointed when i opened the package and saw the defect right away.
3,Shorted,"Pretty inexpensive wire compared to some other brands, but does the job OK. I'm no audiophile, so I can't tell the difference. Only thing that makes me give it a 3 rating is that, as another poster had mentioned, I don't think I got 50 feet of wire. I only needed about 47-48 feet and I was short by a couple feet! I never actually measured it, but by what I needed it was obvious that the spool didn't contain 50'. Otherwise, buying thru Amazon makes it easy, especially with free shipping over $25. I couldn't find 12GA wire at any of the 'big box' stores like Best Buy or Circuit City."
3,It is a cool book.,Probably the kids who like the Goosebumps series would like this book better than other kids. I've read better books and its kind of easy for me. But I still like it.
1,Complete Piece of Junk,We bought 3 of these for two different locations. 100% of them have failed with the same problem. If the power goes out even for a few seconds the unit shuts down completely taking the servers along with it. The problem is that it appears to be doing it's job but when it really matters you find out otherwise. Tripp Lite has been good to replace them but it can't restore my faith in their power protection products. Also of note the batteries in the Tripp Lite units are half the size of those in APC products with the same rating.
4,Understandable Chinese recipes,"This book is helpful both in the recipes given and the illustrations shown. It also has several glossaries and pages of ""how to"" instructions which I found useful."
5,First-rate news and feature writing,"Veteran journalist Michael B. Davie has produced a first-rate collection of news and feature stories, along with his own expert commentary on what went into crafting these award-winning works of journalism.I especially enjoyed the story on a man named Malcolm who turned to lipsuction because he'd tried everything and couldn't get rid of his love handles. The lead sentence: ""The problem hit Malcolm in the middle.""I'd recommend this book to journalism students, practicing reporters and anyone who enjoys reading finely crafted news and feature articles."
5,Great!,"Ever since I got out of the military, I have been having trouble sleeping uninterrupted through the night. I play this CD on shuffle as I sleep and I cannot believe how deeply I sleep now! I have never owned a new age CD before this one, but it has definately turned me on to the genre."
1,Meh.,"Save up a few more dollars and get yourself something nicer. This is not worth the price. Cheaply made. Gets a little damp and smells bad. Not what is pictured. I could have pasted cupboard lining paper on a cardboard box for a similar effect. On the good side, great customer service from the company."
1,Get a Dell or viewsonic pocket PC,"Great little PDA with a fatal flaw. The little joy stick protrudes so it gets turned on in almost any case you may have, this runs down the battery. Also very fragile just a short drop and the screen will break.The camera is a gimic cute at first but pictures are really to low quality (mainly from camera shake, who can hold the thing still) to be more than a curiosity.Pocketpc's are coming down in price and have surpassed the palm os. The Palms time has come and gone.If you you buy a Zire 71 you will be happy at first but sad later.Fred Frader"
2,One benefit but big downside,"Why do I have this controller that will not work on Nintendo Gamecube games that I want to play on my Wii? The only benefit this offers is that it plugs into your Wii-mote and then becomes semi-wireless (still killing your batteries). Do yourself a favor and spend the same $20 on a wireless Gamecube controller. You can still play the virtual console games, plus the Gamecube discs, and not have a remote connected 3 feet away."
5,Fantastic,"This book is a great read - especially considering the young age of the author! It has all the great elements - action, adventure, mystery, and humor - yes, humor. Bartimaeus' character has a wonderfuly caustic sense of humor that had me laughing out loud on several occasions! I simply couldn't put the book down!!! Luckily for me, its easy to read and keeps your interest. I highly recommend it for all ages!!!"
4,It Takes Two,"This is the best guide for parents to learn how to encourage their children to communicate. It explains different ways to establish a special bond between parent and child. It explains how children learn to communicate and ways to help your child through this learning process. Examples of games for fun and learning, music activities, art activities, and even a booklist of wonderful books for children to read are given in this book. This book is wonderful for parents, teachers, and all caregivers of children."
4,Good experience with PartitionMagic,"Partition Magic worked well once I figured out the meaning of the menus. Some actons were performed i did not anticpate based on the description. but, overall, I had a good experience with PartitionMagic."
5,Easy to move,Copies well. Much less weight than old copier to move. Does not have all the features of the old copier but can use computer printer to expand or conract the original prior to mass copying.
1,Jeopardy Patch for Windows ME,"Actually, there is a patch for this game online that supposedly fixes the Jeopardy game for use with Windows ME. Unfortunately, I can't get the patch to work, and the game still locks up at a certain point before game play begins. The patch can be found by going to www.hasbrointeractive.com and following the links to product support."
3,Tristan and Isolde...Y-a-w-n...,"This is the second in Rosalind Mile's Tristan and Isolde novels. The first was ""Isolde, Queen of the Western Isle."" The story of Isolde and Tristan continues as Isolde prepares to succeed her mother as Queen of Ireland. Treachery abounds with King Mark, his nephew and Tristan's cousin Andred, and finally with Blanche, another Isolde, Princess of France.The story plods on with Tristan and Isolde losing each other, and finding each other again and again. It is an okay read but the tale is not told with much passion or intensity. The mushy prose expressed by Tristan and Isolde, of their inner thoughts, is at times somewhat nauseating.I've read all of Rosalind Miles novels and this is by far the worst one to date. It's passable read if you have no other book to occupy your time. It is not in the same class of novels as Mile's novel ""I, Elizabeth."" This was a novel that surpassed all my expectations of a captivating, all encompassing novel."
4,Rocky fans have to see it....,"If you've seen the others, you must see this. So much better than Rocky 5...more ""closure"" and more believable, too. Some really touching moments and be sure to check out the bonus footage. Great stuff!"
1,No room for the rider,"As pointed out by other here, when installed, the weeride doesn't leave any room on the top frame bar, which is really dangerous when you need to stop in a stop light. I have a fairly large frame and didn't work for me. I am returning it."
5,The Best DVD Box Set Ever Made!,"This DVD Box Set for 24: Season 2 is absolutely incredible! If you love the show as much as I do, go out and buy this now! You will not be sorry, it is worth every cent! There's nothing like having a commercial-free, 24 marathon whenever you want! Plus, this will prepare you for October 28th's premiere of Season 3, also commercial-free! There's no question, 24 is the BEST thing on TV right now! Happy Watching! :)"
5,This CD is GREAT!,"I think this is by far the best CD Switchfoot has ever put out. People say they are selling out, but if you listen to ""More then fine"" You hear Jon say ""I'm not selling out"" So there you go. I think the remix of ""Dare you to move"" Is AWSOME! The guitar part is loger and better. ""Adding to the noise"" ""Ammunition"" ""Redemption"" and all the other songs are great! I 'dare you to move' and go buy this CD!"
2,To good to be true.,"I saw this and I thought it was really cool, but then i got it (for a ripp off price of $30)out of the package, after about 20 minutes of taking the tape off, Then I hooked it up.But then, I played it, it is the same thing as the Blue Mrs. Pacman one, only wireless,1.This is way to bulky, the second thing wrong with it was that if you got more than 3 feet away from it, it wouldn't respond that good. The third thing wrong was that the sound is so faint on this, that i had to turn the TV on full blast to hear the tiniest sound. So I returned it and got the non-wireless Pac-Man game, and I like it alot better.The only thing good about this product is that it saves your score."
2,Not what I had expected it to be,I was expecting a black antenna to match my black car. this is silver/chrome. It is very short if that's what you're looking for.
4,Good game that will keep you hooked,"I wasn't sure about this game at first since you can only use the D pad. It turned out to be a lot of fun and really kept me intrested. it has 4 diff. endings and even though it is kind of a sad story, it takes a lot of thought and skill. I really liked it."
1,Junk! Do NOT Buy It!!,"Over 90% of pictures I took by this Canon are blurry. No way can you fix it. I really got fed up with it. Waste your money. Waste your time. More important, waste your precious moments!"
3,Low expectation for specific use,"I puchased this set thinking it may work for use in a racecar and fit comfortably under a helmet. The headset fits fine and works, but the volume output is too low to make it usefull for what I needed it for. The push-to-talk switch is also difficult to use, but again, my intention was to use it in a racecar. I'm sure the set works great for what it was actually intended. Not good for a loud racecar. Too bad, because it fit very well under a helmet."
5,ABSOLUTELY AWESOME ! WORKS FOR THIS INSOMNIAC,"I have severe insomnia, and am being treated for an anxiety disorder as well, and this book is one I never want to be without again. I have been listening to it regularly for about a year ! Some sleep / meditation audiobooks get old fast, and quit working for me...this one never does. It relaxes me even if Im frustrated, angry anxious....this book addresses all of those things so you can get a decent nights sleep...and shut your anxiety or worries down ! I have a lot of these type of materials, but none have helped me more than this one...the authors voice and the music are so soothing...even works if there is noise around me, I can block it out and sleep"
4,So far so good,"I use the coffee maker about twice a week and it does what it is suppose to do, make coffee. It looks decent, but it is made of glass so I worry that it is going to break by myself or one of my lab mates. In general it is a good deal.P.S. If you plan on making coffee for 2-3 people this is the size of press you want. Dont go any smaller than the 30ish oz. It has a footpirnt about the size of coffee grinder (a little taller) if space is an issue."
4,Good Movie,"This was a great heart warming story that I would recommend to just about anyone. Great ratings for the story line and overall compilation of the movie. The only reason I drop it by one star is that in a couple of the scenes the acting wasn't quite as good as I had hoped, but still very much worth watching."
3,Ouch,Received this product in the mail yesterday and I've used it twice now. The first time it seemed to do a good job getting rid of any white stuff on my tongue but that night when I used it a second time I had cut my tongue in a few places. I'm not sure if this was from raised taste buds or because I applied too much pressure. This product seems to do a good job and helps prevent gagging but just make sure you don't apply too much force when using it.
1,Big fiasco,"Simply awful, I thought I was getting a hit compilation by the original artists and it turned out to be some amateur group covering the songs and they can't do it, the music sounds like a joke. If you are looking for a compilation by original artists, we'll have to wait for a while! Note: The 1 star was given since it woldn't let me finalize this if I left the field empty, but really it's a 0."
5,EXCEPTIONAL MUSIC THERAPY,"NEYO IS TO BE COMMENDED ON HIS EXEMPLARY MUSIC STYLE!! I LOVE HIS NEW ALBUM WHICH IS ""TASTEFULLY WRITTEN"".(SMILE) THANK YOU NEYO FOR GRACING US WITH YOUR GREAT STYLE OF MUSIC BECAUSE ""YOU MAKE ME BETTER""(SMILE).PEACE AND LOVE TO ALL,MONESHIA PERKINSFRESNO,CALIFORNIA"
5,HE THOUGHT HE WAS TOO GOOD FOR COUNTRY HE WAS WRONG,"When Graham Brathwaite loses his job as a symphony musician, he finds himself on a touring gig with a country band. It's a real learning experience for Graham, playing small towns and community halls with a motley mix of musicians called ""The Harmony Cats"". Debbie, the group's singer and frank, the band's leader help Graham shed his narrow-minded views on life and become a person with some ""soul"". Harmony Cats is a tribute to all those bands who play the small town circus, looking for that one big break into the big time and a fleeting moment of Fame!Featuring Hoyt Axton"
1,worst summerslam ive ever seen,this summerslam is by far mediocraty at its best.cause thats what this ppv was mediocre i own lots of summerslams and this is not the one i would get cause its very lame boring and slow. i would rather watch the man with the golden gun or license to kill better than this.20th summerslam at its worst.mr mcmahon should be ashamed.
3,Movie Great...DVD Flawed,"I have absolutely no complaints about this awesome film. My complaints are with the DVD pressing itself. I have had 3 copies, all with the same glitch at the 22-26 minute mark. There is a white hazy glare which distorts the picture (flames have lines in them) in this section at the bunker atop Normandy beach. There is also the same white glare distortion at the end of the film where Oppen (Jeremy Davies) arrests the Germans. I pretty much expected a flawless print as all the DVDs I have purchased have been so. I'm wondering how many viewers have noticed these flaws."
5,Terrific Book -- Insightful and Prophetic,"This guy really knows his stuff. The changing nature of business risks is something of value to every manager, regardless of level. I was really impressed with his predictions, especially that of the domestic steel industry collapse based on international markets.The book discusses a variety of themes involving how today's economy requires that companies embrace risk to chase the rewards people want."
3,Not bad entertaining fun read,First book read of Dresden files enjoyed book and will probably check out a few more in the series. Kindle price kind of high...easier to go pick up the paperback at a used book store.
5,"Office, #6","Our whole family enjoyed this season. Who wouldn't? For me,this was one of the best series ever on television. So funny,"
2,I don't recommend buying this.,"If you have the seperate films already on blu ray this set its not for you because the only new things are a cooking school segment with Robert Rodriguez (which is on all his dvds), and some making of the trailers which you could probably find on youtube. Not only that but the older blu-ray copies have lossless audio and for some reason this set doesn't. Who wants a set with lossy audio? If you don't have either of the films yet and you don't have surround sound or HDMI compatible sound on your TV then get this set, But the separate releases are actually better."
3,A hard rocking collaboration from many musical greats!!!,"This is a great cd to throw in and just rock out to. It has a hard edge to every song, with a bit of humor. The best song on the album by far is ""Jerk""! This was the only one that got air play, albeit late at night air play. If you love to rock, buy this cd. No dissapointment here."
5,Excellent film,Great casting. Good plot. Oustanding special effects and character makeup for Hellboy (Ron Pearlman). A must for action film lovers. Buy it!
1,power yoga by rodney yee,I was very disappointed - this is an excellent video but does not play at all on my blu-ray DVD player. I have to play it on my computer and it is very inconvenient to work out in that way.
2,Picture just aint right,Ok. I did my homework; read the reviews; read the specifications; and looking at the the picture for this item you would think that it includes the bottom shelf. My order did not come with this. Very disappointing.
4,Ideal for the beginners,"This book shows you the basic knowledge of Cobol language.It explains quite well the different language features.In addition, throughout the pages of this book, some icons are used to flag important information."
2,Low quality DVD.,"These Kimba DVDs, made by Rhino, were very low quality. The picture is very faded and dark. No restoration work was done at all. Avoid these and get the Ultra Edition Box Set or the Kimba Mini Set."
2,This CD compilation doesn't quite make it!,"I have enjoyed so many of the Rat Pack compilations I couldn't wait for this release. So far though I am disappointed. Granted the re-mix is great and the orchestra sounds crisp and probably better than ever heard before. However the song selection seems bottom of the barrel. Ok let me be nice, the songs seem more a rarities collection. Perhaps the B side of singles, or the last songs added to an album as after thoughts. The cd didn't kick the way Frank, Dean and Sammy would have done it. In fact if this was a live performance, I would think the trio was out in out bored. At times on Dean's solos I even questioned if that voice was really Dean singing. It simply sounded too diluted in the re-mix. I gave the cd two stars because it is still worth a listen, but if today was back in the Rat Pack hey day, this album (cd) would be destined for the $1.99 discount rack."
5,New and Improved!,"If you are looking for a great price guide to price out your comicbook collection, then this is the book for you! Fair, realistic pricing, and fine editorial content as well"
1,HATE CLASSICAL MUSIC,"I wish I had read more about this product before buying it. Classical music is not for everyone, and I detest it. If you are like me and detest classic then don't buy this. I just wasted twenty five dollars."
5,I LOVE this movie,After all what is there not to like about Richard Gere? This movie is a tear jerker but it is still one of those movies that I will watch again and again. I give this one a BIG thumbs up.
3,The way King wanted it to be,"Although the 1980 Kubrick classic is far superior to this one in may ways (acting, writing) this version of the novel was written by Stephen King himself, and is faithful to the novel in every way.The only things that I had a problem with were as follows:1. Some of the acting is extremely hokey...Courtland Mead was good, but they should have hired an acting coach to help him.2. Some of the dialogue was laughable...""Kissin', kissin, that's what I been missin'!"" and (Danny speaking of his mother's drawings) ""Draw good fruit!"" - among other things.Thats about it. Other than that, its a good adaptation of the book, and I enjoyed it. I actually watched this in one sitting-its LONG, clocking in at about four hours and thirty minutes, but its good.Rent it."
5,Simple and Works Great!,"I'm running Window XP. I just plug it in, XP recognizes it and I was downloading files in seconds. No software to install, no need to plug in my digital camera. Can't get easier than this."
5,Indian Thought,"The Author has aimed at eliciting the relationship between Existentialist ideas and some aspects of Indian thought. In the first two chapters, which briefly review modern Existentialism and it's background, the analogies and correspondences have been just indicated by Sanskrit terms juxtaposed in brackets.Their fuller implications have been examined in the third and last chapter: with what success, it is for the reader to judge. It is hoped that the transliteration of Sanskrit is sufficiently clear for ordinary purposes, although it may not satisfy the demands of meticulous scholarship."
1,Dropping connection every 2-3 hours !!!,"I simply hate it.Every 2-3 hours I have to reboot it.Also I upgraded it through internet to the latest firmware.Is it something else or the modem itself I can't tell, but with the same line and PC there were no such problems.All I have changed besides the modem is the router, a D-Link DGL-4500.Before that I used the 2wire 2700HG-B worked GREAT ...Well, I simply don't recommend it."
2,great production and engineering?,"I'm not going to say much about this album music-wise, other than it was your typical modern rock album with one amazing song, one or two decent ones, and a bunch of repetitive material inbetween.However, my biggest problem is about how everyone raves about how good the production/engineering is... yet whenever the lead vocals come in there is a high pitched squeal. It gets pretty annoying whenever I do listen to songs from this album, and it's just not something I can overlook no matter how great of a job they did with the rest of the album."
4,"Cruiser Accessories 20630 Nouveau, Chrome","This frame is good quality and has a nice look. I did not want a frame with the name of car on the frame and the dealer frame looked tacky. I wanted a nice simple frame that compliments my car. This frame meets those requirements. I did not give it a 5 star because I did not know the screw covers would not fit the screws I already used with the license plate. If you want to use screw covers, you need to purchase the screws with the frame."
4,Not for kids,I own all of his previous DVD's. I was disappointed with all of the language in this one. I thought that i could watch this with my family but with in the first 5 minutes that proved to be wrong. other then the language i really like the show.
4,What is the difference between Stiga T8612 and T8612A,"Stiga makes T8612 which is widely available and T8612A available on in Sports Chalet (in California). The T8612A seems to be half the price of T8612. Does anyone know how both of them compare with each other?Both of them look sturdy construction, smooth table top with protected corners.Thanks"
1,The Yearling film,"The movie is incredibly dated now but the score,derived from the music of Frederic Delius, is outstanding. Rawlings, the author of the book upon which the movie is based, and Delius lived in the same section of Florida. Both capture the special atmosphere of the place. It is a remarkable union of screenplay and music. The performance of the boy, Jody, will wear you down with his unremitting wide-eyed wonder. As a movie, I rate it one star, but it has the redeeming virtue mentioned above for those who can enjoy atmosphere aside from the plot."
1,Rash and Bumpy,I bought this thinking oh it's organic must be good will not so much. My sons skin is currently bumpy and red and I've noticed that he started to get some red blotches on his arm where it bends. He never had that before. He's been using it for a more than a week and the bumps and redness persist so needless to say he will not be using it anymore. The smell is like an orange popsicle but when you put it on it smells different I am honestly not to fond of the smell either. I guess I will be sticking with Aveeno daily.
5,Best garlic keeper,"Best garlic keeper I have owned. Very attractive style and finish, holds two large heads of garlic, or three small ones."
1,Outright lies.,"The lies and far-fetched subject of his new movie is just a micro-cosm of what this man really feels. Instead of making a documentary with at least some fact behind it, Mr. Moore has made what is essentially a ""Hate Bush"" Movie and filled it with lies. Look, I'm all for free-speech and every thing, but at least have some respect for the President. I doubt Moore would be able to spend one day in the White House. And if your going to blast Bush - Back it up with fact."
5,Excellent help for ACOAs,This book was very helpful in helping recover as a ACOA. It was Insightful as to what I can do to change behaviors that I have learned becuase i lived with Alcoholic parents.
1,Zero stars! But I love the idea...,"I purchased FoodSaver canisters in a store in various sizes. Every one of them ""spider web"" cracked on the bottom in one or two uses. I give credit to Tilia. They replaced every canister. And every one of the replacements cracked in one or two uses. Now I use them without vacuum for sugar, flour, etc. FYI... I hand washed them so it is not dishwasher caused as one service rep suggested.I love the idea of these canisters and I too wish Tilia would find materials that work."
3,Don't expect too much and you won't be...,"let down.Quite short (less than 80 minutes long), simple story about a closeted student (a cowboy) who fights with his own desires and feelings. Add some nudity, a couple of dirty jokes and hey presto you got ""Longhorns"".It's not a masterpiece and I think it wasn't intended to be. I am giving the 3-rd star for Derek Efrain Villanueva - not my type, but played his part very convincing.Rent it before you decide to buy a copy."
5,best cd ive got.,this cd really puts u into a good mood. u do of course have to like this type of music. it was definitly worth the money. if your like me u will listen to the ones you've heard then just listen to all of them and find u will probably like all of them. very excellent
3,good,"The story line is right from the book, and the acting is fairly good, my only problem was with the photography, the image was jerky at times when the actors were on screen.I had no problems with the special effects, given that it is understood that Pendragon Productions is not a major studio like Paramount.Other then the jerky movments of the scenes, it was a farily good movie."
5,Amazing!,"The Boutenko family has taken a life threatening challenge and turned it into something amazing, special and a gift for the rest of us. A great read with inspiration and validation for a healthy lifestyle."
2,pointless 80's homage obscures better real thing,"Kids, blow these perfectly average (except the Console) tunes off and go to the source: Lime, Telex, Visage, Ultravox. The idea that there is anything 21st century about these tunes is ridiculous... I think some of us need to unplug our headphones and smell the nano-grease.- a biotic garage sound hacker"
2,A low point of german cinema,"forget what the last review said, consdiering this film came out in the post Tin Drum, Berlin Alexander Platz and Agurrie the Wrath of God ear odf german cinema, it is a ture low point of any cinmea in any era. Based on the stanards of the above films it is a conventioal action film , whit hokey dialouge and repitive scenes, peterson is no wirter and no director. dejavu takes over after about twenty minutes when scenes are palyed over and over again( whit remiscancent dialouge as well) Sure this film is on par with any america film becuaes most american films are carp wate of time. No true brillance is shown here , only the conventonal war film with no real philosocial or any over overtones for that matter"
3,Not a self-setting clock -- and not waterproof,"First of all, it's simply not true that this unit has a self-setting clock: I have one in front of me now, so I'm on solid ground when I say that you'll be entering the time and date yourself (not that it's a big deal).The unit itself is fine -- it tells the temperature at the unit, and outdoors using a little radio sensor. The problem is -- and it's pretty hard to believe -- the outdoor sensor ISN'T WATERPROOF. I've had mine for a week: we just had a little light rain, and the sensor went paws up. It's dead. It is an ex-sensor. What? An outdoor sensor that dies in light rain? And this from a company in Oregon! You'd think they would know about rain! I'm about to embark upon the customer-service quest, and I'm sure it's going to be a treat.SUMMARY: if you live in the desert or some sort of sealed underground city, this unit is perfect for you. If, on the other hand, your area ever experiences liquid precipitation, think twice."
1,"Not the original artists, and conveniently not mentioned.","I had my suspicion when I saw the price and it was only confirmed when I received the album, unfortunately it was NOT stated who the artists WERE on the page. I was also fooled by the remarkable forgery of ""Nobody does it better"", (really the only song I TRUELY wanted from this album, everything else was just gravy.) But if they had had ""Live and Let Die"" listed as a sample it would have been painfully obvious... I'd appreciate in the future if albums like these were labeled a little better... I skipped another album like this that was actually LABLED with the artists... Wish I could have skipped THIS one and not had to pay $5 of total shipping for something that I now don't own..."
3,Fair,This book starting off as a very good read. There are some really scary sections. The book is one book with five separate stories and characters and at times gets confusing. The book does tie everything together in the end well but the middle section could have been condensed.
2,May the Schwartz be with you,"You know the thing can't be too good when you are happy, yes actually happy to see Jar Jar Binks. I may have actually burst a vessle trying to hold in a case of the giggles. The problem with this movie is that it is trying to be sophisticated with all of it's political mumbo jumbo speak but it doesn't have the actors that could pull it off. I am sorry but that kid just ain't Darth Vader.p.s. I smell a best actor oscar for Jar Jar."
4,Disorganized Crime,"See six city guys,two cops and four bank robbers,survive their misadventures in rural Montana.Hilarious from beginning to end."
2,Returned the same day,"Despite previous reviews I found that these earbuds fit my ears wonderfully and I was quite excited to finally have a set of comfortable headphones. As soon as I plugged them into my computer to listen to music though the sound transmitted was choppy and very digital sounding. If all you're planning to use these for is with your mp3 player than it's not a bad deal, otherwise go ahead and spend a little more to get better sound quality."
3,Not the best book ever,"Amelia Atwater-Rhodes is a talented writer but she is still pretty young and her stories reflect that. ""In the Forests of the Night"" was an enjoyable, if rather un-original vampire story.However Demon in My View is more obnoxious because the whole Mary-Sue like similarites between Amelia and the protagonist Jessica-basically she seems to have written this book so that she could fall in love with Aubrey and become a vampire herself. Amelia's talent for writing keeps the book afloat but it still not that great. Hopefully she will improve her plots as she gets older."
2,movie is better that the book - yeah I said it,"I enjoy reading novels prior to watching the movie - kindof my little reward for finishing the book. I liked the book but felt that I really never got to know the charachters very well. There is not a lot of descriptive writing about the dad and boy. Most of the book revolved around eating and being cold. The movie however I felt I understood more about who the characters were and how they felt. If you like novels with conversation shy away for this one - 2-3 word questions and reponses. Overal ""The Road"" was worth reading to prep to see the movie but I do not think I would buy another McCarthy novel."
4,WOW,"WOW! Sabuda does it again. I don't know how these books are mass produced. Amazing detail down to Abe Lincoln in the Lincoln Memorial, and the spinning wheels on the boat. Incredible.Only complaint is the everything is whitepaper, except the backgrounds. Would have liked to have seen color on the pop-ups like his other books."
2,HELEN SLATER,She is the only reason to even view this mess. Not enough time spent with Helen's character! Hard to get through. Too much Faye Dunaway. A big was of time.
5,Love this show. British comedy at its very best.,"I use to watch this show on tv,but happily I found it on here to watch. It's very dry type of humor & love it."
5,BEST CHRISTMAS PRESENT,"I ALWAYS WONDERED HOW THESE THINGS WORKED SO I BORROWED A DIFFERENT BRAND AND THEY WERE TERRIBLE,THEY WERE CALLED TV EARS. THE RECEPTION RANGE WAS HORRIBLE, I COULDN'T EVEN GO INTO MY KITCHEN WITHOUT STATIC, AND I HAVE A SMALL HOUSE. SO I SHOPPED AROUND ON LINE AND FOUND THESE. I READ THE REVIEWS AND THEY WERE ALL GOOD SO I GAVE THEM A TRY. THEY ARE GREAT. I HAVE BEEN USING THEM FOR 3 MONTHS NOW AND THEY HAVE MADE MY EVENING TV WATCHING SO NICE. I WENT OUTSIDE AND WALKED ALL AROUND THE HOUSE WITH THEM AND THE RECEPTION WAS CRYSTAL CLEAR. THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THEM IS THAT I WISH THEY WERE A LITTLE SMALLER AND FIT A LITTLE MORE SNUG ON MY HEAD, OTHER WISE THEY ARE GREAT AND EVERONE GETS A GOOD NIGHT SLEEP. THEY WERE ON SALE ALSO FOR A GREAT PRICE. I WOULD RECCOMEND THESE TO ANYONE WHO LOVES THEIR TV."
5,"This was a really, really good book","I thought that this story was completely believabable, after all, strange and terrible things often do happen to people. And people can and do change as a result. I read this book straight through, and think that Ms. Leavitt is a wonderful writer. Definitely read this book - you'll go from tears to joy."
3,"Funny story, ridiculous people!","It is apparent that the author agrees with the theory shared by many of us non-Americans, which is that even an idiot can have money in America. The main characters in the story are simply some white trash women from the States who wander around aimlessly in France, insulting everyone, including their own contrymen. The only intelligent women in the tale are the two friends Amelia Jackson and Desiree Simon, both who are hard working women in exile in France, apparently trying to escape the very characters they meet up with on the French Riviera.The wedding banquet at the Negresco was quite amusing. Personally, I feel that the story would have been more successful if it had less characters. I think that the transexual characters were superfluous. Nevertheless, it was an enjoyable read."
2,I Tried Hard To Really Like This Book... But To No Avail!,"The WWII thriller is my favorite genre and the plot of The Second Objective seemed like it would be right up my alley; i.e., a special group of twenty German commandos who face almost certain death to achieve a ""second objective"" during a last ditch effort to defeat the western allies in late 1944. However, Mark Frost's unbelievable, one-dimensional main characters, coupled with the unrealistic, flawless American-style English dialogue they speak and their ability to have at their fingertips minute details of specific aspects of American life, took away the pleasure I was hoping to get from reading this book. Further, while the book has its share of murders, Frost describes them in a pretty actionless and unexciting manner. Obviously, I was highly disappointed in The Second Objective and do not recommend it to you."
1,Not as funny,I didn't like this cd as much as some of the previous ones. Its like hes trying to clean up his act a little because of his family. The other Larry the Cable Guy cd's are much funnier than this one.
3,Too much cooking and gardening,"This is a beautiful book but it lacked something for me. For one thing, there is a lot of gardening and recipes - I skip these sections in magazines and am not much more interested when they appear in a book. The house is stunning but I would have liked a bit more explanation of how the house developed over 30 years as well as more photos of the interior. At the end, I didn't feel that I knew the house very well. I feel this book is for people who like very cluttered ""money is no object"" decorating with antiques. I much preferred ""Winter House"" by Charlotte Moss."
2,Returned it,The watch was good looking but too heavy and the date dials were impossible to read. Watch was returned.
4,Cannon Scanner.,This scanner is easy to set up and use. I find that Microsoft software is easier to use to edit the scanned 35 mm slides than the software that came with the scanner.
5,you can't put it down,"This is a wonderful book. Once you get started you can't put it down! If you have not read the other books on the Delany family, don't worry for Ms. Oke catches you up on where they have been to the present storyline. The way she bring the message of God and his teachings is simply excellent, and she also ties this in to today's society and how easy it is to relate to the characters just like you were there yourself. I hope there is a sequel soon! I love her books and would reccommend them to anyone!"
2,Not First Printing,"I bought this book thinking it was an adition to the autumn book line, it says first printing. I guess i need to pay closer attention because it is a reprint of the first book by a new publisher. Ripped off. I will not buy anything by this publisher again."
1,Very short life,"I bought this pill splitter in November 2012 and have only used it to cut a pill every other day. In early February 2013, it quit working because the sliding plastic that covers the blade has jammed the pivot, preventing opening and closing the unit properly. While it worked, it splitted my oblong pills perfectly. Obviously, this device has malfunctioned after very little service."
5,A truly amazing book with with everything a great book needs,"This book is about a boy named Fabrizio who is an apprentice to a magician master named Mangus. He was given a pardon from the king which saved his life, he was charged with witch-craft which was illegal. So when the king's daughter is being taunted by a spirit he calls on good old Mangus thinking that he can just snap his fingers and rid the spirit of the princess for good but it's not that easy. Also to put even more pressure on Mangus, the King's adviser count Scarrzoni, whom everyone in the counrty knows has the real power at court, threatens Mangus that if he doesnt' rid princess of the ghost he will kill him and Fabrizio.but why would count scarrzoni go to so much trouble to protect the princess who hates him?"
2,Not as Interesting as You Would Think,"The good thing about this book is that it showed me that if Ms. Zalickas can get published, I can probably get published one day. It has a juicy title, but it is not too interesting of a read. I kept waiting for something to happen. Nothing really did. She gets drunk in high school. She gets drunk in college. Ummmm....join the club. Granted, her drinking is excessive but she really doesn't have anything creative to say about it. I found her writing subpar. At times, I felt like I was reading half of a college essay and half of a novel. She also repeats herself over and over and over again. ""I got drunk because I hated myself. I got drunk because I couldn't be close to someone."" Yeah yeah yeah. I GET IT. She also goes on these diatribes about drinking and masculinity/femininity that are these random generalizations."
1,Please Dont Buy it,"I was really disappointed with Toto. My favorite songs of all time is ""Hold the Line"" i brought this DVD mainly because of that. They just totally screwed it up it sounds so different, the lead singer is atrocious i could do a better job than him. Steve lukather i thought was a great guitarist but he totally disappointed me the solos have no resemblence to waht your hear in their studio albums. The rest of the band is ok. The song I liked the most in the dvd is ""Africa"". The audio and video are excellent.VERDICT: If you are a hardcore TOTO fan you might like it otherwise please dont buy it."
4,stories for some people,"The Book _Leaving Home_ is a book of short stories that some people can and do relate to. Personally I like stories that i can relate to with my personal life. The sum of the short stories that I have read have been mostly set when I wasn't even born yet. On the other hand the stories are fun to read about other people's experiences and becuase they seem to be true life stories it is interesting to see anothers person perspective on a different situation. In a poem writen in the book the poeple wanted to get out of the town they lived in, i saw that as breaking free from life and i thought that was a good choice to put in the book titled Leaving Home."
4,Animal abc's!,"A fabulous way to connect the ""A, b, c"" with actual words - especially for my animal crazy four year old boy. He loves seeing the animal & what they eat, & enjoys telling me that Alligator starts with A, etc. It is only North American carnivores, so there were a couple even I didn't know (English Mum!), so we both learnt those together!"
1,"My, what a pity!!!","Sort of like the old joke quoted by Woody Allen, such an awful season, and so little of it! Can't believe they have the nerve to charge full price. And just as bad breaking up Season 6. I have the first four, but that's where I get off. If we let them rip us off, they'll just continue to do it."
4,Cromwell,"'Cromwell' is about power, the movie depicts the struggle betweenThe Parliament and the King... that eventually starts the English Civil War.King Charles is played superbly by Alec Guinness a thespian of the highest order- (King Charles)is an ineffectual and some may say a weak King, bringing the monarchy to its lowest ebb due to his indecision and the backing of the Catholic over the native Church of England (not Protestant but a REFORMED CATHOLIC church) amazing what we can learn at the movies!Anyway... Cromwell's new army, wins the Civil war and the Parliment takes its new place at the head of the country.Richard Harris is good, but somewhat over the top, as the brooding Cromwell, his voice is croaky and at times the Irishman looks all at sea! the musical score is average, well shot and framed... An excellent informing entertainment, a movie well worth watching."
1,"Easy to BREAK, traffic updates are practically worthless","Product broke while trying to remove from cigarette lighter. For a $200 part I'd expect them to design this to be little more sturdy. Traffic updates are barely any use. It oftenly shows an incident that's no longer an issue or doesn't show problems that it should.Getting this unit with your GPS is fine, just be careful when removing it from the cigarette lighter.Do not consider buying this if it didn't come with your GPS. It's a waste of money."
2,The Majority,"Persons with no military experience are easily taken in by such spook stories; to many, 'the military' is some unfathomly vast entity, and each has their own concept that this is some powerful, complex, and unknowable organization.Likewise for 'the government'. People would have you believe that politicians are proccessed from birth, like suicide bombers, or la Cosa Nostra, with an unbreakable facade presented to 'the public' in order to keep their agenda secret. All these secrets would take tens of thousands of individuals to accomplish and maintain, yet not even one person has ever revealed anything? Even by mistake?As for the UFO nonsense, I hesitate to waste even one sentence on such foolishness, except that it serves as an accurate indication of intelligence level, akin to those who parade their ignorance under the flag of creationism, declaring the world to be as ignorant as themselves."
5,Desert Island Cookbook,"As my cookbook collection continues to grow, this book remains one of my favorites. It is a well written classy book that I personally admire. It is definately a book for foodies and not a quick reference for some quick dinner ideas.The recipes are very obviously real and tested and if one wishes to acheive the best results do not try to take shortcuts. As far as finding certain ingredients, there is a wealth of resources availible online and virtualy any ingredient that you can imagine can be found if you look."
2,The pictures are pretty of Suzanne,"...but little of content in recipes. I was dis- appointed to learn that most recipes had carbohydrates and sugar...no no's. Plus, the recipes seemed to be for dinner parties, with special ingredients that I would guess most people don't keep on hand. She didn't need to remind us that she lives 'high on the hog' - come down to earth with the rest of us, Suzanne!"
4,Inexpensive table saw worth every penny,"A starter saw that helped put the finishing touch on a beautiful cabinet installation convinced me to come out of woodworking retirement and attack a complete kitchen remodel. Yes it's inexpensive and could use a bigger table, but for a portable saw to cut cabinet trim pieces and other small projects, it is great. Sure I'll be spending [$$$] for a Jet next year but this was worth the minimal bucks today."
1,STILL WAITING....,"I'm still waiting for the movie to start. I didn't see the first movie, but this one was bad. Crude sexual humor, fart and feces humor, and it really wasn't that funny except for the sour cream Sanchez which I had to explain to my mother.Brief nudity and you never see the girl's face attached to the Ta's Ta's, which means they were a body stand in.Outtakes and bloopers were just as bad as the film."
1,Worst DVD ever,"I had been waiting so long for this movie - probably my favourite David Lynch - to come out on DVD that I grabbed the Canadian import the moment I saw it... unfortunately it is by far the worst quality commercial DVD I have ever seen.The format is pan-and-scan (i.e. 4:3 ratio) only and the image quality is appalling. The sound (Dolby, supposedly) is little better. It is basically unwatchable. Another user review says that the DVD is somewhat better than VHS - I would say the image quality is on par with VHS, and certainly not worth the four stars that reviewer gave it; I cannot imagine how any DVD could be worse than this one.I am sure that David Lynch had nothing to do with this hastily cobbled together sham. He fine tunes his DVDs (even to the extent of removing chapters from ""The Straight Story"") and I am sure he would be furious to see his movie butchered in this way.This DVD is of the quality I would expect if I bought the damn thing from a street vendor in Shanghai; ..."
3,"Great, but too predictable","I really liked this book and thought it was well written, but it had an identical plot to Jenny. The guys in both books were keeping secrets. Plus, the girls in both books thought the guys (Kurt and Trevor) liked some other girl, when there turned out to be a reasonable explanation for the guys' realationship with the other girl. I really loved Jenny and thought Kathy was great too, but they're just too similar. It made reading Kathy not as exciting because I could predict Trevor's secret, since it was so much like Kurt's. You'll have to read both books for yourself to see the similarities. I definately recommend them."
3,bought it for my son,"I gave my son a tape player with my old lady tapes (he's in his forties) and he had texted me to include oldies for nostalgia...well I only had whale sounds, relaxation and meditation tapes to give him...so I ordered some from different eras and on a budget. If I was trying to wow him my order would have been more specific but I had to rely on generalized cheaper (not collectors items) tapes so he could have the nostalgia on my budget. This will do that."
3,Poor Stereotypes,"In _Bad Boy From Rosebud_, well acclaimed book from the bookfair in Austin Texas, there are some all too typical examples of otherwise well researched, good writing, failing to get a good grade due to the use of poor stereotypes. At one point the author is describing a run down neighborhood of dilapidated trailers: ""... a Harley Davidson motorcycle and a bright shiny pickup truck...""I cried Foul! Not fair to pick on Harley Davidson and then fail to identify the brand name of the pickup.In another paragraph he is writing of the ""menial jobs [such people] have as burger flippers in fast food joints and cashiers at convenience stores.""Likewise--Foul! As long as respected authors characterise such work as ""menial"" then those who do that work will continue to think little of themselves.--ajo"
4,Cool!,"I could not open the iPod nano using only the tools that came with the kit, but with the help of a tip scissors(and using the tools in the kit TOO), I can open the iPod without damaging it. Now we need to change to get a soldering iron to replace the battery. Taught others how to replace without soldering iron. If I can borrow one, I'll do this as they spoke. The important thing is that for a small charge my iPod nano (First Generation) will return to work again!"
3,A good read like all of Zane Grey's Westerns,I like reading any book by Zane Grey. Some of his books should be ranked among the Classics. There is no reason for excluding westerns from this accolade
4,Wicked Jaguar,"I recently heard Wicked Game on the Jaguar X-Type commercial and went nuts trying to find out the artist until my step son told me it was Chris Isaac. I knew I had heard the song a couple times before in movies and sure enough a search showed it was used in ""The Family Man"" and ""Wild at Heart"". What ever CD you get Wicked Game on you can't go wrong."
1,not worth the money,"I liked the illustrations but the story line is poor, cheesy and lacks substance...but then again let's consider who wrote it...Madonna...that should explain why. Just because she is a celebrity, the book is getting much attention. Take it from an experienced children's writer, don't bother wasting your money on this book. If you are curious about the story line, wait until it is available at your local library....then just browse and then put it right back on the shelf where it belongs, to collect dust."
5,The only quilt book I'll ever need!,Quilts!Quilts!!Quilts!!! has all the information I need to create my own masterpiece quilt. The book's photographs are awesome and inspiring! The directions are clear and concise. There are so many patterns I can't decide which one to make first.
4,Good read-- informative and inclusive,"I just finished this 700-page history of colonialism in Africa. It was precisely what I was looking for-- a look at colonialism in Africa; who did it, where, why, and for how long. The only fault I might attribute to it is its emphasis on the white male players who made it all happen and not much on the Africans' perspective. Nevertheless, it was an extremely informative book that cut none of the imperialists slack. Germans, English, Boers, French, Italians, Arabs, and King Leopold the Belgian were all given equally (brutally) honest treatment. Good job, Mr. Parkenham!"
5,A rare gem of a 19th century mass.,"I was just a bit distressed to find only one recording of this work when I searched for the name of the mass and the name of the composer. This is a fine example of a composer's doing more with less. The liner notes indicate that the work was written to appeal to provincial tastes and be performable with a smaller than usual (certainly smaller ensemble than Bach or Mozart could call up) group of performers, so that his Catholic patrons would smile on his efforts.Like having the limits of rhyme and meter in poetry, these strictures seem to have produced a really remarkable work. If you have any interest at all in liturgical music, you need to track down a recording of this work!"
3,Greatest Comedy Ever!,"This 2nd season is probably my favorite one. My favorite episode is ""Movin Out"" and it was severely shortened. I suppose it is just a matter of business with DVDs. In several years there will probably be new edition of Alf released completely uncut because that is what they do with all the dvds out there. They have to keep something in store for the coming years. In general this is one of the best tv shows I've ever seen and I'm glad I still preserved the old uncut episodes that I ripped from TV. On average every episode on this dvd is shortened somewhat 2 to 3 minutes."
5,It's a Good Movie,It's a good movie and worth getting the popcorn and butter out for. The movie gives people a lot to think about yet it's also entertaining.
4,One way EasyPower,This item is only good for drilling. Don't try to use it in a reversible drill like I did that only opens the chuck as there is no way to lock it shut. Other than that it did what it was suppose to do on other projects.
5,My Go-To Portrait Lens,For the price of this lens you can't go wrong. Picture quality is great. Its made of plastic but shouldn't but too much of a big deal for most people I'm sure. This is apurchase I won't regret.
1,"If you like your liquids all over the place, this one is for you. :)","Just used this to make pasta sauce. Big mistake. The holes in the lid, for adding dry and wet item, also allow your food to go flying!Yes, I could put my hand over it, but the point is, it's a silly design.Back it goes."
3,Exercise book,"Here is how, in 10 minutes a day, to achieve a youthful body and increased vitality-without tiring exercises.Ingrid Bergman, Frederic March, Gloria Swanson and many other notables have benefited from and enthusiastically endorse the Mensendieck system of movement schemes. Now, for the first time, this world renowned system is available in sample, popular form. The 43 easy to do movements are scientifically designed to revitalize specific muscles and joints. They help you end backaches.. flatten the abdomen.. Take inches off hips and waste.. And sculpture the chest and correct other body faults.."
2,Not a good book for those who don't believe in god.,The end of the book was disappointing because she shows really believes in God. Otherwises the book is pretty boring. However the shifts for present to past are quite clear.
3,kind of flimsy,"expecting a better made product, it's ok, does the job that i need it to do. i probably would not buy this product again."
1,Review from a parent!,"My daughter is 6 and enjoyed playing this game, however, anytime she wanted to turn it off we had to write down the lengthy code and then type it back in when she wanted to get back to her last level. This is a definate problem for parents because the code contains hyroglyphics, numerals and letters...trust me, it would sometimes take me 5 minutes to input the code. Also, you have to keep a new code everytime she gets new points and the code changes completely. Much wasted time for the parent and child!!!!"
2,Not Necessary,"This product is definitely not a neccessity. The wipes stay warm once unplugged for about an hour only, and it's way too big for a travel case. There is also a too-long cord that hangs off of the case, it's really annoying. It would have made more sense to have it unplug directly from the case."
3,Not a Nobel-Prize...,"This series were bestsellers- I actually don't know how the books got there. I read all Belgariad books, there actually was some tension, some fun, some goose flesh - it wasn't a bad book at all, but it lacked depth. All characters were so simple, so very, very predictable. What surprised me most is the fact that there were simply no complots, and it was most of the time just Garion and his companions running around and slaying easily everything coming their way. It was too straight to be a great read - the evil never really seemd to be a challenge for the characters or just overwhelmingly powerful. Having read the first couple of books of the Wheel of Time or the Greenangel-Series I'd say that there are two different worlds: those were intricate and mysterious novels, this was a hero-comic in prose. However, it does not mean that you get bored while reading it."
2,Mildly Entertaining,"The best things this movie has going for it are the cast and the production values. Cast issues are obvious. Production values are surprisingly high, and take an otherwise bizarre, absurd concept into watchable territory. Frankly, the movie concept is not at all interesting, and will largely appeal to fans of D&D. Further, the gradual unfolding of the story leaves far too much to be wanted; it simply makes little sense and cannot rely on a David Lynch or Tarrantino level of artful telling to save it. There are a few scenes featuring battles with monstrous figures; the figure are, putting it mildly, laughably bad. Perhaps that was the intent (in an Army of Darkness kind of way, there are obvious parallels), but the whole thing just fails. So...the production values (i.e., image quality, camera work, etc.) are good enough to make this watchable, just don't expect a thriller."
1,Don't waste your time,This is just an excuse for a sequel and has no redeeming qualities. The characters have been robbed of their personalities and the humor is non-existant. Very disappointing.
2,A Fish Out of Water,"Cry makes me want to do just that ... it's a pity Faith's abandoned what works in search of something that just doesn't exist, at least not on this album. The only thing more patetic that this attempt to ""cross-over"" into pop divadom is Faith's ""Cry"" video. Faith, honey, not all the black eye make-up in the world will gain you entrance into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame ... let's fire a few producers and get back to what works."
1,Before you buy,"Before you buy from this company, try to contact their customer service department in case you experience any problems in the future. I'm not sure a customer service department really exist at MPIO. Unbelievable. I've been trying for months to no avail.I liked my MPIO because of the small size. But the display disappeared after nine months(and the manual isn't well written). Without the display,I have no way of being sure what I'm doing when I push buttons. I've given up on them. After calling and emailing tech support for five months, I'll go with a company that demonstrates that the it truly values its customers."
2,Undersized,"I made the mistake of thinking the print was as advertised 24x32, it is actually undersized. I bought poster frames to match the advertized dimensions and of course they don't fit. Art.com gets no more business from me."
5,This album is the BEST!,"This is Sara's best release so far. This CD is 100% her and 100% amazing. Her vocals are showcased and allowed to shine in each and every song. The first single ""A Real Fine Place To Start"" already has been at #1 on the charts for 2 weeks and the new single ""Cheatin"" looks to be a huge hit too! Every song on this CD is incredible but some highlights are: Coalmine, New Hometown, Supernatural, Cheatin', Momma's Night Out, and Bible Song. Do yourself a favor and get this CD today. You definitely won't regret it!"
2,Puhlease!,Not a fan of this book. I wouldn't recommend buying it if you are over 21 years of age. I particularly don't care for huge coincidences being so central to the development of a story. Total cop out. Best thing about this book is the cover.
2,"Watch out for the ""POP""","As others have said, my unit makes a very loud ""pop"" or ""crack"" when you pause/stop/play or advance the tracks using he adapter and the Blackjack. Two stars, however, for uber-fast shipping and doing (basically) what is says it does. I am waiting for Eforcity to get back to me with a resolution to the popping problem. Perhaps a replacement, as others are not reporting this issue.Alright, after fast service from Eforcity, I received a replacement. Same loud POP. I think this is limited to the BlackJack (i607). I do not recommend this item for the Samsung BlackJack. Get something else."
3,Kashi TLC Chewy Granola Bars,"These bars are good, but a little hard. I have to warm them up in the microwave to soften them up."
1,not even a guilty pleasure,"Wow. Amazing. I was so very impressed at how bad this movie was. There were others in the theater that shared my point of view; I know this because I could actually hear them roll their eyes during the ridiculous courtship and expedited consummation of the Cruise and Newton character's ""relationship."" I know this because I heard them laughing during the tedious, overwrought ""action"" sequences. And I know this because I heard them HOWL when Cruise emoted his laughable dialogue to Newton before parachuting from inside of the building.A real triumph in bad movie making. Bravo Mr. Woo!!"
2,I ended up giving this away...,"It may be a good product but at least put the right size dog on the advertisement photo because the medium isnt that big at all and looking at the dog on the pic would be incorrect, on the medium only a full grown cat can fit on it. I bought this for my lab and he could only lay his head on it, I felt no warmth at all and I should have just bought him a heating blanket in his bed would have been cheaper and warmer. This may be a good product but I didnt see it perform. Easy instructions and seems duarable but the little cover slides right off when the pet moves around on it."
4,Different,"This book is telling the life of a teenager going throw the teenage usual life. He has an older sister and brother. The teen in this book, Charlie, is writeing a letter to someone unknown. When he starts hanging out with Sam and Patrick, they lead him to new adventures. For example: smoking, drinking, ..., getting high, and going to wild parties with sex. If you like this kind of book it will be good for you. The language isn't that good. But if you like books that can prepare you for life in a way that you might face these things, then this book will show you some things about life. But don't be tricked about the book when you first read it, it gets better, and the end is something you would never expect."

2,Disappointed,"I was very excited to receive this product at first. When it arrived, I opened it and the perfume AND the lotion didn't smell like it's supposed to..almost as if it has been sitting on a shelf for years. Very disappointed, especially since I paid $80 for this!"
3,It does some damage,"This has damaged the roof of my NEW car. Only 3 months old and now a dented roof where this is located. The bars come loose and my foster dog has tried to crawl through and got stuck while I was driving. It just isn't a great fit for the Prius V and if you have a mat in the back, the challenge is greater. If you have a gentle dog that does not like to 'challenge' the fact that he needs to stay in his area, this might be perfect. I am tired of having to tighten the bars every week and I am bitter about the damage to my car."
5,Magic Tree House books,I ordered this series of books for my grandsons 7th birthday. He loves the books. They arrived very promptly in time for his special day! Thank you. Donna Partyka
4,Star Trek: Next Generation - Borg,"This four tape/episode set includes, ""Q Who?"", ""Best of Both Worlds I & II"", and ""I,Borg"". ""Q Who?"" is the initial introduction to the borg where Q flings the enterprise to the far reaches of the galaxy. ""Best of Both Worlds"" was the overwhelming fan favorite and two part season finale (a full season after ""Q Who?"", where Picard is captured and the borg invade. Finally, ""I,Borg"" where the Enterprise captures an injured Borg drone. ""Q Who?"" and ""The Best of Both Worlds"" are Star Trek at its best, and can be followed even if you are new to the series. ""I, Borg"" leaves something more to be desired, and is quickly forgotten afterwards. Nevertheless, this is a great box set."
4,preppy but fun,"I like this workout because it is fairly easy to follow and it gets your heart rate going. At first I thought it was kind of cheesy becase the dancers in the video are all white girls, however, the lead dancer is talented and a great teacher. I do think that the hip hop is definately of a more ""cacasian"" style but it is still a lot of fun and there are some challenging moves during the workouts. It is a great buy for the price."
4,Good but not GREAT!,This is a good book with a great story line and mechanics. It is so short that my son finished it in a couple hours.
1,Too quiet to be useful.,I tried this headset on my Panasonic DECT 6.0 portable phones and found that not only was it too quiet to hear the person on the other end but that I had to shout to be heard. I returned this product after attempting to test it on a few other phones with no improvement.
2,Looks great but....,I bought this for traveling and as far as overall appearance and functionality it looked great. The problem was 3 days into the trip the bottom left shoulder strap came off. I sewed it back on and then a few days later THE TOP of the left shoulder strap came off. Next time I think I'll pay a higher price for a better product.
5,Another great book from Jim Bell,"If you liked Complete Idiot's Guide to The Bible, then you'll like this one. I've known Jim Bell from his well-known Christian books, so I'm glad to see the Idiot's people have picked up one of the best for their religion books. He really breaks down what Protestants believe and why in an easy to understand way that doesn't make you feel stupid. I'm going to use this in my Bible class over the summer."
4,Very beautiful bracelet,"The bracelet is beautiful and appropriate for dress or casual. However, it is difficult to clasp. I would still purchase again because it is so attractive and comfortable."
3,Good product but ear pads fray and distortion a prob,"The ear phones are comfortable and work well. Over time, however, the ear pad cushions fray because they are not leather and the whole earphone needs to be replaced. Also, the receiver which attaches to the TV must be directly aimed where you are sitting or you will get distortion. This can be pretty aggravating when you move from one seat to another."
3,"Good book, needs work","I purchased this book for my Social Statistics class at CU. While it was as described in the product description, their are many problems with the actual product, especially for a 5th edition. There are many poorly worded definitions, a poor glossary, and an incredibly large amount of typos. A decent book for low level statistics, but not much else."
2,Not what I was looking for,"I am getting ready to create some online training courses and bought several books to review and this book was one of the least helpful to me. I might have found it more useful if I was in an institutional environment which appears to be the intended audience. There is a great deal of theory and discussion here, but not a lot of practical information. I also didn't find the writing style very engaging and lost focus many times.If you are looking for more real, hands-on information, I highly recommend E-Learning by Design by William Horton which I found covered most of the topics discussed here in a more engaging and useful manner."
3,good for posta,i also burnt the handle on this one the first time out coustomer svc said not to use it on two burners but i thought that was the point thay will replace
4,Good second effort,"I am, overall, impressed with ""Life For Rent."" I was expecting to give the album 5 stars, but I find myself just a bit disappointed with the album. I can't quite explain what it is; all I know is something is missing. I think the stripped down music is a bit of a jolt when compared to ""No Angel."" Nonetheless, I am pleased with the CD. Standout tracks for me are ""White Flag,"" ""See You When You're 40,"" ""Who Makes You Feel,"" and ""See the Sun."" I am not too impressed with ""Sand in My Shoes""--sung too quickly for my taste. ""Do You Have a Little Time"" is MUCH better live, although it is nice here. Actually Dido live is better than any album.She should seriously consider a live album. She is a much better live performer than studio artist. The songs transform into something much more beautiful and haunting when she is on stage. Oh, the album!! I recommend it---you won't be disappointed :0)"
5,Fun Fun Fun! and Erotic!,"I really love Angela Knight, she is a very HOT writer and this is a fine example of her work. This was a fun read and a HOT read. A keeper too. You will enjoy this book. I know I did!"
1,A Sad Farewell to Leon Uris,"`A God In Ruins' indeed. Leon Uris' latest work -- perhaps an indication that he is the god in ruins. I grew up on Leon Uris and came, over the course of three decades, to revel in his attention to detail, his grounding in truth, his objectivity and his ability to weave a tale that had a point and yet did not preach. In 'A God In Ruins', Uris has become a one-eye-blind street preacher, sermonizing the book away through barely possible characters, a semi-credible plot and a set of issues that, although important, do not justify the context of the book. As though to add insult to injury, the book is full of little errors -- ridiculous things such as Eastern time being three hours behind Pacific.I bid sad farewell to Mr. Uris' work, hoping only that I can revisit `Battle Cry' in all its glory un-tainted."
3,Gerald Morris is going Downhill,"I was really disappointed with this book...Of all his books so far, this one was the least funniest and almost completely tragic. Also, one of the techniques that the author employs a great deal in this book is character maturity and growth. If you want to read ""How quickly a character may mature in 100 pages or less"" definately read this book. I would have never thought that Morris could write about something so boring and common place. Originally I liked Morris books because I felt he mocked social norms..but in this book he completely disappointed me..."
1,Cheap Junk,"Thin junk. The cover is not removable, so you have to wash the whole thing. After on washing it got lumpy. Not worth $100."
3,Under the Hammer,notation said book was is fair to good condition - which it was and that was okay but the book had pages missing. It was at the beginning so important facts about the investment scheme were missing. I was very disappointed since I paid more than expected to get this book.
5,Very Entertaining Book,"A wonderful novel that deftly takes the reader from a spirited old man's hospital room to Circus trains and back again. Based in part on a menage of historic events, Water For Elephants is full of adventure and fantasy. I really enjoyed it."
1,One Blatant Illustration Ruins This Book,"This otherwise nice story on the ever-popular theme of a family finding a pet is marred by one blatant, jarring element of the illustrations. Throughout most of the action in the book, the father is wearing a t-shirt that clearly shows a large, lit cigarette, which could be tobacco or marijuana, I'm not sure. The illustration is vivid and visible on several pages. WHY? I am all for depicting realistic people and settings, but when there are so many excellent children's books, why choose this irresponsibly illustrated book?"
1,BEWARE: Korean edition,This DVD is the Korean edition. Pretty misleading on the part of the seller - nowhere in the description does it mention that it's in Korean.
2,not what I expected,"I got these so that I could throw them into the back seat of my car and not have them leak. They failed. Firstly, it is difficult to screw the top on correctly I think because the threads are not deep enough. Then, when it is screwd on tight, if tipped, it leaks. Lastly, the mug is too large for small to medium hands to grasp and press the lever to open. If you are driving it is near impoaaible. They are pretty."
3,"iPOD Shuffle Headphones, too big for many..","Bought these headphones to use while running with my ipod shuffle. They work just fine but are quite large. That is, if you have big head (physically) they are probably great. I have an average sized (female) head and they are too big. I was really hoping they would work but the smallest setting was still too big. The sound was fine so I don't want to be too negative about them, just know that they are really made for adult men."
2,slow speed,netgear 624 will download 450kb sec wirelesslinksys with speedbooster only will do 250kb net gear with card cast 54.99 with card
2,Disappointing,"Let me begin by complimenting the skills of this 14 year old. Very impressive to know that the author was so young. However, it is VERY obviously written by somebody who is inexperienced. I think the book could have turned out MUCH better had she co written it with her editor. I walked away with so many questions. There are 2 stories within one story and they don't mix well. The characters could have been developed a bit more. Actually there was so many characters that I wanted to learn more about but she didn't give enough of a description. Lots of fluffy words --- she definately gets an A+ for her use of adjectives. Lots of gaps!!!! Great to show kids as an example of what they can accomplish however you can spend you money on something better."
1,Pointless,"(1.) This movie starts out poorly by self promoting for 10 minutes other movies with no skip/ff option. (2.) About a third of the movie is low budget staring at the screen shots & dialogue - boring. (3.) Another third of the movie is a C grade disjointed rip off of B grade Mexican spaghetti action scenes - lots of fire pots; very fake shoot outs; pursuit & crash; thieves stealing from thieves. (4.) Can''t Indian movies present, for the most part, females in roles other than smiley, head & hair turn, vulnerable sex toys? (5.) Thank you, fast forwarding."
1,The Lost Jewel,"I don't know how people can give this movie 3 stars. Don't waste your money. This movie stunk!I don't have a problem with Amazon Prime, I think it's a great deal, but sometimes I come across a movie that is awful. This was one of those times. The Forgotten Jewel with Jackie Chan was rotten, and I don't recommend you wasting your money on this movie."
4,Great Value for the Money!,"This lens is a great value for the money. I use this lens for shooting action shots at sporting events and have found it to be a perfect fit, the quality of the pictures are good and I am able to capture good action without having to be too close."
4,"Great for desk chair, not for car seat","this cushion is a big help for severe tailbone pain. I use it at work and it's great. I bought a second one for my car and it's just too big to use, even for an SUV seat. Very firm and it keeps its support and I'm a big person. Would definitely recommend this product."
4,Painful yet compelling,"The author shows a lot of anger in her writing of this book and upon reading it you will discover why. The cruelties inflicted upon these children put the child welfare system, the school system, law enforcement and the town they grew up in to shame! This was a painful book to read, I felt helpless for these children and disgust for the adults in their life who did nothing to help them.I believe the author has a long road ahead of her before healing herself, if she ever can. Powerful reading."
1,Skip this one...,"If you do buy this book, do not read before driving or operating heavy machinery... It is extremely boring and sleep-inducing... I suppose I should mention some specific points in the book as examples, but I can't, because nothing written in it will stay in your memory for longer than a couple of hours...It was very difficult to finish, which was probably the same feeling held by the editor, as this book is riddled with typos and grammatical errors...Anyway, stay away from Marrow..."
4,"Repetitive, yes, but a good ending to the series","Having called this a good ending to the series, allow me to elaborate. I was expecting a big blowout. Instead, it kind of petered out, as if it ran out of steam. However, it is more realistic this way - a lot of wars peter out when the combatants are tired of fighting. And it served as a useful setup for the Colonisation series.The major gripe is the same as I've had with the other books in the series - too repetitive! I guess this is useful if you had to wait a year between installments, but surely if you've read all the 3 previous books, you realise by now that the Race has a long history, that they can't mate without female scent pheremones, that Earth is colder than Home, etc. Still, an entertaining end to an entertaining series. I will definitely pick up this alternate history in Colonisation."
2,Where's Rumi?,"Persian period of that time is complex and formal. Mowlana is a master of poetry as well as a master of Sufi. His depth, artistry, and complexity is missing. I also find it a little deceptive to call oneself a ""translator"" when one does not read or speak the language from which he is supposedly translating."
3,Should have done a little research,"I understand that as a minister, Jesse Duplantis is inspirational, not necessarily a scholar of any kind. But it seems before writing a book with this title and focus, you could spend about thirty seconds on the Internet and find out what the term ""natural law"" actually means in Christianity. As a moral guideline, natural law has a very long and honorable tradition, especially in Christian faith. This book confuses the issue. Even though Rev. Duplantis explains what HE means by natural law, that's not what natural law actually is.If anyone is actually interested in the topic, I would recommend either ""Fifty Questions on the Natural Law: What It Is and Why We Need It,"" by Charles Rice, or ""Written on the Heart: The Case for Natural Law,"" by J. Budziszewski. Both of the authors are also Christians."
3,bad copies,"The Harman kardon CDR 20 is a great burner, except the fact that when you dub cd's, various tracks have a distortion and a static error on them."
2,Why is there only one F@&!$n' song?,"I am trying to find a specific CD, and I can't do that when I am told that there is only one song on the CD. If, however, there really is only one song, then I apologize. If not, I would like to be informed of the other songs, or why there is only one. There is also another one with untitled songs also by Ice T. THANK YOU"
1,Watching Paint Dry,This was the slowest movie that I have watched in a long time. Who ever handled the marketing did a fabulous job....they fooled me!! The only reason I watched it till the end is because I had paid for it and really hoped that eventually it would get better but it did not. Thumbs down for this.
4,More good stuff from Origina & Bill Bruford sax-man,"Tim Garland continues his recent creative roll on this quartet outing. During the last few years, Garland has ably branched into small-group chamber jazz (Storms/Nocturnes), big band arrangements (Dean Streat Underground), and alternate time signatures (Bill Bruford's Earthworks). This energetic outing breaks explores a quartet with guitar, which changes the sound significantly. John Patitucci and Gary Novak provide great communication from the rhythm section, and these songs groove and swing where needed. Paul Bollenback's guitar is a nice surprise as he's a player I had not heard before. Garland has a number of strong and memorable melodies in the songs proving that he is coming into his own as a writer as well."
3,Mapmaker's Wife,"International Books said they sent me the book on February 5th, as this was a book for a book club meeting on March 1st, I felt I would receive the book in about a week and would have plenty of time to read it. The book arrived Feb. 27th. While I have tried to contact International Book, to ask them why they thought the book would take 22 days to arrive, I have been unsuccessful in doing that. I won't use their site again."
2,i dont get it,has anyone noticed that there are two versions of the same film? there is the original and then this Special Edition.) did anyone also notice that the original costs more than this Special Edition yet both have the same extras--NO EXTRAS?!!Does it strike anyone else as this being odd?
4,An Otherwise Perfect Headphone,"I wanted so much to give this a 5 - the sound quality is superb, the price is right and the frequency response range is awesom - yet I just cannot believe Audio-Technica would be this skimpy on the cushion material around the cups on such a nice pair of phones. It is really a shame to see a pair of cans that deliver such good audio quality have so thin a ring of foam that the inner fabric that covers the speakers touches your ear and make it very uncomfortable, the cushion cover rings themselves are also too small, so they are not really around your ears as it should be, but instead pressing on your ears all the time - it's uncomfortable and your ears will sweat. It's a shame, it would have been a five star phone. Sound is rich, clear, accurate to the source, sound scape is great, I am hearing nuance that was never heard before - an otherwise perfect headphone for budget audiophilers."
4,Great project for a kid,This was really fun and easy to make. Didn't even need to read directions real easy! I even had left over paint and was able to use the blo-pens for other projects
5,This is one of the best books I've ever read.,This book is so awsome. I loved the way Brittany Ryan wrote this book. Extremely well written and it's got a very cool story line.Normally I wouldn't like a story like this. I'm more of the Harry Potter type. But something in this book drew me in and I couldn't put the book down.Five stars all the way around!!!
1,"YUCK, YUCK, YUCK","Horrid, absolutely horrid is the only way to describe this book. Last few John Saul books have been the same. Last book of his I read. You have to wonder: what happened to John in his childhood to have such gruesome stories come out of his head.Don't bother with it."
1,Awful--Don't waste your money,"I bought this based upon the description thinking that it would be perhaps a more ""hip"" way to learn vocabulary words since my kids were listening to other audio SAT vocabulary CD's. When it arrived and we played it you could barely understand the words. We kept looking at the CD thinking did they ship me the right product? It just sounds like bad rap music and it has ZERO value in teaching someone new vocabulary words. The concept in the product description was not found in the actual product!"
5,This CD is Awesome,"the cd really moves u, especially ""hold on"" and ""fumbling towards ecstasy."" i would recommend it to anyone"
3,Not exactly Blaze Orange,sturdy leash that should last a life time. If you check the orange against something blaze orange you will see a difference.
3,no title,"Slim little volume that nevertheless is packed full of crafts using shells and stuff that would be found on a beach. And very easy, simple instructions.But the section on shell collection is telling you that the best shells are still filled with a live animal, and, essentially you have to kill it - either by a very slow heat or by burying it in dirt. There seems to me something horribly askew here, though, when a book for children (or anybody for that matter) instructs you to kill an animal, no matter how small, just to add to a collection. And then you have to carefully remove all the remains. This for kids?Still, it does have a useful guide to the different shells of both coasts, plus all the different seaweeds too. Plenty here to keep a crafty kid busy for a summer at the beach."
3,Good Start To A Series.,"I liked this book, it was a fun read but it just didn't completely capture me like some of her other books have.I did like the story line and the characters so I would be willing to try the next book in the series. I know that sometimes first books in series can be rough so I am hoping the series gets better as it goes."
3,Product review,"This product did create flakes, I purchased it because of other reviews stating that it did not create flakes in your hair."
3,Nice collar but...,"The collar is nice, it is fairly soft and light weight and has a nice breakaway buckle if the cat gets caught on something. BUT - the collar of the buckle is awful! The collar itself is a fairly light green color, not far off from the photo. But the buckle parts are shocking neon lime green. It looked so bad on my poor cat that I ended up using a different one."
4,Very Elegant(cool watch),I love this watch I like the way it feels on my wrist but and here come the but the date on the clock should be remove since you can not see any how unless you have a maginfied glass besides that I love this watch who need to know what date it is we all have cell phone for that:)
2,Review is specific for this combo pack more than the movie,"I ordered the 3D/Bluray combo pack for the action/graphics. It's a typical Will Smith big budget action movie (so if you like those you'll like this).I don't post many reviews but I wanted to on this 3D/Bluray pack because the 3D disc does not play on my Vizio 3D Bluray player. The disc acts like it is going to load, and then just ejects. I ordered it a second time thinking that I had received a defective disc the first time. I was wrong. The second one did the exact same thing.Save your time and money and order a normal DVD."
1,Premature Wear,"Am I the only one having this problem? These foils aren't lasting me more than a few months. And, no, I don't push the razor hard against my face, I use it at a 90 degree angle, and I don't have an abnormally thick beard. I've used Braun razors my whole life and for some reason my 8595 goes through foils like nothing else. I've even had the entire cutter unit (motor) replaced under warrenty just in case that was the problem. Personally I think the problem is in the design of the foil as the thinner mesh just isn't as strong as the previous design. Is anyone else having this same experience? Is the newer 360 model any better?"
3,Good enough,"This DVD player/VCR is pretty nice. It looks nice on the shelf and it works pretty well, but its a little confusing to use and set up. It is working well now, but not optimally because I can't quite figure it out."
2,Good machine when it's working...,"I sew quite a lot, at least three times a week and have had this machine for four years. At first I was in love with it, the features were great and all the stitches were wonderful. However it didn't take long before it started acting up and now it seems to break on me every 3-5 months. It may just be that this machine is not made for such frequent usage, however my most recent (and most expensive) problem that I have run into with this machine is that the whole feed dog component collapsed into the machine. It would have been cheaper to buy a whole new machine than to keep forking over $50 here and there to maintain this one. If your looking for an inexpensive machine for beginners than this is a good choice, you pretty much get what you pay for so if you are a frequent sewer than I would recommend forking over a little extra cash and getting a more durable machine."
3,Jumps,"I purchased the moonshoes for my two boys. Although they absolutely love them, I was expecting a little more, especially for the price. The jump was fun for them, but the picture is a little misleading. I was under the impression that the shoes would allow my boys to jump very high ...like in the picture, however, it's more of a springy jump."
4,Fascinated,"My toddler is fascinated by this line of toy. We have a ton of them and he will get a hold of them and just stare at them. turning them over and over in his hands trying to figure them out. How they work, make the noise, or shake them into action. He spends hours playing with these blocks and absolutely loves them."
1,Horrible product,"After about 30 days of use, this unit ate tapes and the timer did not work. After sending it away for 7 weeks to an authorized JVC service location, I got it back and the auto tracking (and the manual tracking for that matter) could not provide acceptable video output. Also, a tape got stuck in the carriage and when I went to pull it out, it caught on the cheap plastic cover on the tape opening and broke it. JVC will only reimburse me for 1/2 of the product cost for a product that I got little to no usage from. Oh well... Stick with Sony."
4,It is all about the ART,"I loved this movie cause it shows that dedication and love for ones passion is a one way ticket to the top. Rickson gives his philosophy of life not just fighting. He is unbeatable in my book. He is the Bruce Lee of today. No one can beat him in freestyle fighting, who is tuffer than him? Check it out. made me want to learn to control my breath. the reason i gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because there is some down time when the other fighters are being shown. but well worth seeing this man do his thing."
5,Well Worth the Wait,"After falling in love with their last album, ""Take-Offs and Landings,"" I could only hope that their latest effort could be as good. After the first listen, I knew that this album exceeded my wildest expectations. There are many catchy songs, but I think my favorite aspect of Rilo Kiley is the way they can make a song shift from mellow to total rock. It's hard to pick a favorite song on here, but ""Spectacular Views"" is incredible, as is the title track and ""Paint's Peeling."" If you are a fan at all of ""Take-Offs and Landings"" or their previous EP, this album will not disappoint."
3,Instructional Value limited,We watched all three DVD's and in our opinion there is no instructional value or race footage. I can't see how this type of DVD is useful to skier's. There are much better videos out there for ski coaches.
3,regarding henry,My wife liked it. She is more into that type than I. She thought it was good. Harrison Ford is good in anything he plays in.
5,One of THE BEST,"Firefly is not only one of the best Sci-Fi shows, it is probably one of the top ten series ever on TV. And the movie was even better. Hard to believe it was cancelled. One can always dream that it would ever comeback.I like StarGate, Battle Star G, Babylon 5 etc. but Firefly is in a class of its own, even above these others."
3,different thinking about silver,thought this to be holly grail.been reading about the difference between ionic and real silver.seems ionic is better for topical non is good for ingestion. will stick with organic virgin coconut oil.
1,Disappointing,"Overall his humour is low-brow and unintelligent; he speaks in a slow, un-engaging way and the topics he chooses to discuss are not ones that people can relate to universally or that truly highlight the comedic nature of life. He just swears a lot and crosses a lot of lines. Very disappointing."
5,absolute funniest play ever,I'm a huge Tyler Perry fan and this is just one of the 4 movies I owned that was stolen from me. I decided to order them here because of the price. Awesome deal!!!
5,must read,funniest book ever. plain and simple. buy it and read it. (not reccommended for femenists!)
5,Love it,I love this perfume. It is light and not overpowering and I have received several comments on how great it smells.
4,Scary wake up call,"I remember watching this for the first time by accident while I was channel surfing and was drawn into it. It is a very powerful look at what could have happened during the cold war, and could happen today. A lot of people have said if there is another World War it would be caused by accidental circumstances or rouge elements. I really liked this movie, decent actors, good plot. It was a scary look a potential events."
1,irs not that good,"I love STP....they rule still to this dayand I love GNRplus I got this cd early from the Labeland for free!!!and I saw them live in Chicagobut sad to say but this cd is""cliche'd rock....at its worst, withthe worlds best spokesmen""a sad sad day................"
2,Not so much about Tantra,"I was under the impression that I will learn about tantric sex techniques. But honestly,I was rather disappointed. It was more like a guideline how to practice porn sex. I have some knowledge about Tantra. It is about tapping into the unlimited sexual energy that resides in us and using this energy to get in touch with our own spirit as well as to connect to our sex partner at the spiritual level. In this way, we get in touch with the Divine inside us and realize it in our sex partner as well. Tantra is ultimately about spiritual awareness. Well, this DVD set is not even close in achieving this goal."
2,Its kinda...not that great,"Its an ok book. It had just enough to keep me going...and I hate to start books without finishing them. It just has too much conversation in it. They can be talking forever and then suddenly you realize: ARE THEY EVER GOING TO SHUT UP AND GET ON WITH THEIR WOLF BUSINESS!?...or whatever it is they are supposed to be doing. I mean they spent too much time talking and not enough time ""rescuing"". It was annoying how concerned they were with their friend's love problems and not so much with the missing little girl. Overall, I would say I will probably not be buying any other books in this series."
5,Good movie!,"Good movie, even if your not a race fan the storylineis well scripted & addictive. The acting is pretty darn good too.It's not an Oscar winner, but I enjoyed watching it andwill keep it in my collection!"
2,Looking for something different,"I got this befor previewing it. It was a letdown for me. I am a big BNL fan, I love most their stuff but this was just not that good. You can always pick it up as a novelty album."
3,Pretty predictable!,Ok movie to watch but very predictable. Malik Yoba is a great actor so you'll enjoy him as usual. It comes on TV from time to time so you could wait. It usually airs on BET network I think.
4,Great tools at a great price,"This Dewalt combo pack is a great purchase for anyone wanting the best cordless tools. You get seven great tools for an unbelievable price when you consider that solo, most of these tools sell for between $190 - $290. The battery life on the dewalt units are great, I recently sheet- rocked an entire room on the same battery and it was still driving as strong as when I started the room. I also purchased a Jig saw so now I have 2 chargers and 4 batteries, nothing can slow me down now!"
2,Generic.,"There's nothing really special about this book at all. It was kind of a disappointment considering how good some of Elizabeth Chandler's other ""Love Stories"" books were. Instead, try another one by her: ""Hot Summer Nights."" It's more interesting."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"Photos indicate a large unit sturdily built like my 15yr old shredder. Not so, the parts do not fit together, the hopper is only 15 inches across and would hold only a small amount of leaves. The black hopper attachment is a flimsy piece of plastic, Guess where this was made! I am hoping to return mine. Customer service at Flowtron recommended using oil to get the upper and lower units in place! When that didn't work, they offered to send another top unit as there have been alignment problems."
3,Not bad,"Good sound, pretty comfortable. My biggest complaint would be the lack of privacy, people around you can hear what you are listening to."
4,Nice electric toothbrush for the money,"For the money you spend on this electric toothbrush, you will feel a cleaner mouth. Worth the money compared to other electric brushes. Also a plus because it has a small brush head. Some of the other brushes have brush heads that are too big."
2,elementary introduction,"nice pictures, no remarkable insights. very short chapters on various wars. perhaps the best thing about the book is the bibliography."
3,Fun romantic comedy,"3.7 stars I enjoyed this romantic twisted knot of a tale. The women had strong independent roles and were intelligent. I've had enough of the poor dumb women clichés'. It was filled with quick snarky lines and tender sweet moments. Yes there was a'bad' buy and although he wasn't stupid he was an idiot and very believable idiot.Now about the story, I don't really need to tell you anything about it. It's a contemporary romance, there is a cat, a handsome man, a woman,one witch of a woman, the evil man, some friends, two crazy nut-o families and some really good Italian food. If you're looking for fun, light romantic comedy with a HEA this is a good book for you."
2,"Fine product, but listing is unclear","First and foremost, the product is fine. The glass looks like plastic (which it is) but is well-sized for a frozen drink and it serves its purpose. I have not washed it in the dishwasher, so I cannot speak to its ability to hold up (minus the heated drying cycle).Most importantly, if you linked to this item for the pack of 18 - let it be known that despite the description saying it is a ""set"" and the name saying ""glassES,"" plural, this is one singular glass that you will be purchasing. If you are looking for a set of multiple glasses, this is not the item for you."
3,disappointing,"After reading ""The Uncommon Reader"",by Allan Bennet, I thought I would try some other books by the same author. While they were humorous to a point, they by no means held up the same way as ""..Reader"" did. I was very glad that both stories, ""The Clothes They Stood Up In"" and ""The Lady in the Van"" were extremely short!"
2,An Average Romance,"Despite the convincing performances of both Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep, this movie is too slow, long and repetitive for its own good. The plot is interesting, even if it doesn`t bring nothing new, making for an enticing enough relationship with some subtle moments. Problem is, it also drags in most of the scenes, and the constant overexposure of the lead actors becomes tiresome and unappealing. The settings could be more diverse too, since at times it seemed like I was watching a play and not a film. And although it never reaches corny melodrama, it gets too sappy at parts. Overall, not a bad movie, but not a masterpiece either. Far from a must-see, it still is worth watching once, though."
2,Cheese slicer,"Cheese cutter quality was good. However, the cutting wire would not lock-in on the metal slicer bar. The slicer groove was inside the marble platform. Move the marble cutting slot and problem would be solved. I had to regroove the cutting bar to make the cutting wire stay in place. (Manufacture error.)"
4,NICE EASY SEASONING,"I enjoy this mix...not quite as spicy as i anticipated from the name, but it is good on everything."
3,Aerosmith Sold Out to the Man,"Aerosmith created an album called Done With Mirrors that was really good, but nobody bought it. So they brought in a bunch of writers to help write popular songs. The song ""Angel"" resulted. To sell this album they used such an awful radio friendly song that was nothing like real Aerosmitha and they also made a huge deal about how they had recovered from all of their heavy drug useage. This IS a great story but it's stupid how they used it to sell the album. Also interesting is that they still call Joe Perry and Steven Tyler the ""Toxic Twins"" in the midst of telling everyone that they were clean! Still ""Rag Doll"" is likeable and ""Dude! Looks Like A Lady"" is funny because it was written about Vince Neil of Motley Crue and is cool in Wayne's World 2."
5,Very Great Story,"I discovered Lisa Jackson years ago and I read this novel the first time it was printed. Beware, this is not a new story, but a re-print of one of her older novels. I knew this when I bought it, but I purchased it anyway as I loved it then and I love it now. Sometimes re-visiting an old novel is like seeing an old friend again.The story was great! There was plenty of suspense and believe it or not I could not remember who the killer was! The romance was great too and I loved the character Navada. Lisa's story telling has changed over the years and her newer novels seem to involve more mystery and suspense, with less romance than her older novels possessed. Oh, but this is not a complaint! Her new novels are great also, but there are times I miss the sexier men she used to write about. So I find myself returning to re-visit time and time again.I would reccommend this novel to anyone who loves to read romantic suspense! She won't let you down!!!"
3,Kevin Blechdom - Bitches Without Britches,"It's nice to see that not everyone takes the IDM movement so seriously. Kevin Blechdom's Bitches Without Britches combines (perhaps for the first time) glitch and country-western guitar with some humorously over-the-top smutty lyrics. Blechdom goes right for the funny bone with tracks like ""Binaca"" and ""Interspecies Love."" Her remake of Tina Turner's ""Private Dancer"" makes you feel like you stepped into the only strip club that gives change for a dollar. And ""I Am Nastay"" is perfect for your local S&M club's main room. Once the novelty and shock wear off, however, there's not really much else to the album to recommend it. It's fun and would be great to put on at parties to get a laugh, but after that, it's pretty easily forgotten."
3,Not strong enough,"I have a basic problem of having been brought up in Spain. So, I'm oriented to good strong robust coffee. In my research, I concluded that this would be the strongest available for Senseo. Still not strong enough. This morning I used 2 pods to make a short cup of coffee. Its getting better. I also just discovered that they make a pod filter in which I can place my own coffee grounds. I will order two of these and test them. I feel this may be the answer."
3,Book is great for the time it was written,"But it doesn't compare to the original series. It's like real life, only with dragons as pets. Left some loose ends open, too."
4,Best blue tooth headset for Treo 650,"I have tried, tested and returned no less than a dozen other blue tooth headsets from various manufacturers and have found this model to be the best in fit, feel, and function.It is lightweight, fits comfortably on your ear (either side), seems to have unstoppable battery life (I can run all day, charging my Treo 650 2 or 3 times during the day and headset still works great). I actually bought this one for my wife as we have the same phone and mine has worked so well for me.The only reason it's not 5 stars is that the way the mic sits on my face it can cover the mic port once and awhile. I simply added a little rubber pad to the mic 'boom' so it sits off my face just enough to keep the mic hole from getting covered. My wife doesn't have this problem, might be an ear shape thing!? Other than that, it's awesome!"
5,Very good novel,I was glad to read the novel. When I started reading the book I could actually relate it to the reality. I can imagine the pictorial view point of the author and then was surprised to see that it made a change in me.We all think that just because we have education we have everything but we are wrong since knowledge is better than education. One may forget the matter he is taught in school or college but not what he/she has been taught by life.This is a story of true friendship and loyalty by a friend.
4,Moeller 6 gallon boat fuel tank,"Like others, I've found this to be a good above-deck tank. It is exact duplicate of an older Moeller tank I own and its contours are an exact match to the inner hull of the 16 ft. Amesbury Dory that was built for me by Stur-Dee Boat Co. I have not experienced the problems with leaks at the seams that at least one other person reported. However, the tank is not without its problems. The fuel gauge seems permanently stuck at the 1/2 full mark, a problem that a Moeller representative indicated may be due to some excess plastic ""flashing"" on a gauge component. (I was urged to remove the gauge from tank and file down any excess flashing with an emory board.) There was no documentation with this tank indicating that meets the new EPA zero emissions policy. The Moeller representative I spoke with confirmed that this tank is legal for engines built in 2011 or earlier. However, because of the filler cap it is not legal for use with 2012 (and newer) engines."
1,do not buy this curling iron!,"I wanted a curling iron for overseas travel -- this one is advertised as DUAL voltage and 220 convertible -- I got it overseas and lo and behold, it is absolutely NOT dual voltage -- what a waste of money and not having this available overseas left me high and dry -- return policy is too cumbersome so I am stuck with a falsely advertised product on Amazaon with no options left!! Will think twice about purchasing anything from Amazon for now on!"
5,perfect compliment to the D30,"I hesitated to buy the battery grip because I thought I didn't really need it and that it would make the camera too bulky. But it is a great accessory that is ALWAYS on my camera now.I don't worry about battery power much anymore since there are always two inside.And best of all, I can snap photos in the vertical orientation so much easier. It's seamless. In addition to having an additional shutter-button on the battery grip, there is a focus-point selector button.Certainly worth having."
1,Don't Get them,"the magazine is decent, but there Customer support is [...]. They wont help you solve any issues and wont send there magazine to the right address. I personally wont buy from them again. and my family has had a shutterbug subscription for almost as long as they have been in business. So in my opinion you should look at another magazine if you want to get a product that you can rely on."
1,Another Sensationalist Book from the Flat Earth Folks,"I don't want to sound like an alarmist, but this book, and many of its ilk, that claim that ADHD is over-diagnosed (it's not) and that medications are extraordinarily dangerous (they are not) misleads way too many people into not exploring appropriate treatments for their children. There is a persuasive group of ""flat earth"" people who still believe that ADHD is not real, that it is an invention of Psychiatry, and that medications are not a reasonable treatment. When they get others to read these kind of books, they do a great disservice to a scientific perspective and the children who count on parents and adults to make fully informed, 21st century decisions.If you must buy this book, do your children the favor of buying another book that gives a balanced, scientifically proven perspective. Don't just be sucked in by the rhetoric of anti-psychiatry fanatics."
5,Now THIS was a fun purchase!,"I've been buying from Amazon for years. I've had good books, great books, good tools, etc. You get the point. I have had more ""fun"" with this than any other purchase.This is one of the few purchase I've ever made where I really feel like the author lives up to the billing. After having read about 10 - 15 of the reviews here, I can only say I echo what everyone else is saying -- to include the part about the cheesy caveman stuff. Distracting, but harmless.A great learning tool that I still enthusiastically return to after having listened and learned for several weeks!"
3,Not a great live band?,"Having been a long time Covenant fan I had really high hopes for this album as I've never had the chance to seem them live. The collection of songs is great, but what really struck me is that they seem to miss on the performance.Inflection and tone found on studio recordings are completely missing in the live set, and many of the songs come off as flat or dull because of this. I was honestly really surprised."
3,"Useful, but not super","These labels, when aligned correctly, can create a label for the hub of a CD or DVD. Unfortunately, the first label printed after loading the spool is often aligned incorrectly, wasting a label. Small file-folder labels are an adequate substitute."
1,not that great,"Maybe the movie got better during the last half...I turned it off. It was just a dreary, slow movie with no significant plot....just some drunk's dull life. The acting was superb, but every story needs a plot. Definitely not my cup of tea."
1,Little Foot,I was very disappointed with this toy. The quality was terrible. The neck was very flimsy and it didn't hold the head up. I would not recommend this item to anyone.
2,Heavy-Handed re-hash of old material,"With this book I expected what the subtitle promises -- ""a lively history of steamboating on the Mississippi and Ohio rivers.""But there is little or no new material in this book. It consists largely of old accounts, mostly contemporary with the steamboat era. Most of the extracts are long, and even with spelling and punctuation modernized, they're difficult to wade through due to the obtuse language and the amount of commentary not related to steamboats. The library of any really serious student of steamboat history will probably already contain much of the original source material for these lengthy quotations. Mine does.If you seek contemporary ""verbal snapshots"" of a few eccentric individuals who traveled once or twice on steamboats, this book may be for you. For the serious steamboat historian, however, it covers too little new ground to be an important history while, containing too much heavy, archaic language to be an enjoyable read."
5,Great SHOW!!!,Enjoy the twists and turns!!! Fun show to watch!! Got addicted last season and had to continue to this season!!
4,Great Case,"Fits camera real well. Storage compartment could be a little larger, but the price can't be beat."
3,"Works well, but looks USED","I purchased this frisbee new, so I assumed it would look to be in somewhat new condition. Instead, I open the package and I find the ""new"" frisbee all scratched up across the edges and the face. There also appears to be some layer of stickiness to it that this sort of plastic really shouldn't have if in new condition. (It's not a packaging problem either because I ordered 2 other things and none were in similar condition.) I would've rated this product 5 stars as it flies well and does what I want it to do, but I docked off 2 stars because I expect a new product to be new when it definitely was not in this case."
1,"This price, both used and new, is absurd.","This two disc compilation is beautiful and moving just like the art of capoeira. I would certainly purchase this, but not at the expense of reason. It is a shame that price mongers take advantage of enthusiasts, who wish nothing more than to partake in the cultural experiences of Brazil from the convenience of their homes. Often, people who can't afford to make the trip personally or have local access to music or artifacts within a reasonable distance go through platforms like Amazon to buy things at ""fair"" market prices advertised through the net and television. Do not be a victim of the hype because there are other vendors out there who will not price gauge!Go to capoeiraarts page and search this same artist to receive this same cd, brand new for a fraction of the price.I'm not bitter, I'm disgusted."
2,Fan - low air flow for the high cost,"I am using this fan for about a month. True it is quite, tilt-able and small but it also lacks the ability to create a strong airflow for the high cost. I bought this fan when my 5yr old box fan, cost about $15, stopped running. The box fan created at least 2x the airflow for much less cost. The reviews give an impression that this fan produces a strong airflow - not in my estimation."
3,"Not great - again, you get what you pay for","This box is built cheap, the hinges didn't align the wood properly, the wood has chips and imperfections in it, and though I ordered ""maple"" it could very easily be mistaken for a dark oak. Backing and rear screws are cheap. I opted to get this after reading all of the negative feedback, and all negative so far has been correct. It does however, suit the purpose so far for a very cheap price."
1,Home Cafe HCC100,"I called the company because the coffee wasn't hot enough (only 140 degrees). They said it should be 160-170 degrees, and I must have gotten one with a bad thermostat. Stood in Christmas exchange lines and got a new one. What a coincidence...this one also brews at 140 degrees. I then e-mailed Black & Decker, and they said it was designed to brew at 175 degrees, and it appeared that I had received TWO defective units. After reading the other reviews on this website, it appears there are an awful lot of defective units that are being sold in the stores."
5,key fob for Ford,exactly as described. Arrived in about 1 week and in great shape. Still have not programmed it yet but have no reason to believe it won't work.
3,"Better, but not the best","The 4th edition is much better than the 3rd mainly due to its readability (the color is nice too). The ease of use and understandability is still not up to the level of Nelson and Cox's ""Lehninger."" MBC does cover more basics than the Lehninger, but it is less intuitive and more diffucult to read."
1,good sensor gone bad?,"After about 10 ueses, the display reads 199 degrees no matter what I do. I tried resetting, changing batteries -- no change."
3,Not bad,"I have the demo version of the game, which is pretty comprehesive. I enjoyed the game a lot, but it isn't a very accurate sim. All the ships act the same, doesn't matter if it's a big freighter or a little fighter they are all the same in agility. The AI isn't very good either, they just are stupid what else can be said. However, the storyline is pretty cool and I like how it's laid out and how open ended it is. If they combinded Freespace and Freelancer you would have the best space sim ever created. Oh and I would give it 3 and a half stars."
1,Amusingly Simplistic,"i find much of the book's central argument to be absurd. i am left wondering if any research or thought has gone into it at all. neither drug dealing nor drug use is a victomless crime. ever seen a mother abandon her children in favor of coke? it ain't pretty and it is very much the business, not only of myself, but of all Americain citizins. if rich white people want to play revolutionary i suggest volunteering their time at a rehab center."
1,Doesn't fit VX8300,Does not fit a Verizon VX 8300. Don't waste your time and money. Junk. Very disappointed with both products. Order elsewhere
4,Solid introduction to funny cars,"My wife and I saw this on television when it first came out and were delighted with it. More a documentary than a drama, it is an excellent introduction to racing in general and funny cars in particular. Well worth it."
3,Watching Your Life Passing Before Your Very Eyes,"Steve is a black teenager from Harlem. ... He doesn't have a perfect life, not by far, and he doesn't make the best choices. This book is written as a screenplay. It took several pages for me to get into it, but don't give up. In a short time, you will be completely drawn in. Steve is lookng at potentially spending his life in jail. Read this thrilling book to find out what happens to Steve's life."
4,A Good Way to Live your Life,"When I first had to read this book for my Honors Economics class, I was very unsure if I was going to like it at all. I have always had a hard time getting along with coaches whom I played for so I was wondering why I had chosen a book that was about a coach. But my fears were laid to rest once I started reading this book; I came to realize that good intentions really are behind many of the decision that coaches make. This book was very well written and kept me wanting to read more. John Wooden's ""Pyramid of Success"" can be interpeted in many different ways. So many aspects of life apply to this pyramid model which can serve as a guide during those moments of feeling lost. This book was entertaning yet full of lessons for a successful life. I especially recommend this book to all athletes who question their coaches' widsom as well as to people who could use a little guidence through life's journey."
1,Easy To Use But Not On Smell,"I bought this product because of the reviews I saw here. While the Diaper Dekor is very easy to use, my experience found that it does not keep the smell contained very well at all! The diaper genie does a much better job with containing the smell and I can get the refill for the genie at most convenient stores near me. I'm very disappointed with this product."
4,Size matters,"you might want to be careful with the size of your strap button or width of the strap before buying this but other than that... i bought this cuz i couldnt be bothered to screw out parts of my guitar for a strap lock, its simple and works great."
5,"Excitement, excitement, excitement.","If you want action, you've got it here. From the beginning through the very end the pace never lets up. I don't know who Dalton is, but he obviously has an insider's view of the military and writes about the various services with authority. This is a Fail-Safe for the 90s-- one has to wonder with machines taking over more and more functions, where the line needs to be drawn."
3,Skip this one.,"First of all, I'd like to say that I use the Artscroll Machzorim for Rosh HaShana, Yom Kippur and Pesach. This machzor however tries to cover too many Yom Tovim (Succot, Chol HaMoed Succot, Hoshana Raba, Shmini Atzeret and Simchat Torah). You end up flicking pages forwards and backwards too many times. In my opinion, you are better off using the standard Arscroll Siddur and buying a guide to Succot.One more point. Do NOT!, I repeat DO NOT use this machzor in Eretz Yisrael. There are simply too many differences. Because those privilaged to live in Eretz Yisrael only have one day Yomtov Succot and a combined Shmini Atzeret/Simchat Torah, this machzor will totally confuse you."
5,Excellent buy!,Can't beat the price. These are OE cartridges. Wonder why the OE price is so much higher? Love this bargin.
3,Key Rock Hider,"This product does look like a real rock, but it is quite small. It blends in nicely with the rocks in my yard."
4,It's all around you,"If an Electric Sea had a soundtrack that would play every time you went swimming in it, this would be it. Tortoise taking a little more electronica dub approach with this record. Still mellow Tortoise, but not so much bass drums xylophone and guitar, this time it's mostly synths and computer samples and stuff."
2,Re-read Joseph Conrad,"""Perfect Storm"" a tragic tale simply told with little visceral impact. For style, character development and visceral contrast re-read Joseph Conrad's short stories: ""Nigger of the Narcissus"" and ""Typhoon."" Most of the four and five star reviewers will drop their scores . . . I bet."
2,very difficult to use,"Considering what this book cost it is not worth it. The CD has no descriptions and you need to go from book notating what the number is making it very time consuming. The Graphic work is very simplistic and has nothing to offer that is outstanding. Again, useful stuff, but way too much money for what is being given."
4,My kids like it.,This is a pc game for children. My children (age 5 and 6) enjoy playing it. They understand the controls and have fun with it.
4,loving care lotion,"This is the only hair color that I can use. It works for me since I have no other option because I am allergic to other hair color. Unfortunately, Clairol has opted to discontinue this product because I was told it had a small market share. Shame on them, because there are other people like me that are allergic to hair color, and once the supply runs out -we are out of luck. I am very angry that the bottom line has once again become a priority and I hope they will reconsider taking the product off the market.I was able to purchase 6 packages on Amazon but many internet stores are either out of stock or much higher priced since it was discontinued by Clairol."
4,Very Good Read!,"Even though Will Lee didn't feature prominent in this novel, the little he did was very enjoyable. The story was interesting and fast paced. Everyone involved did a wonderful job, especially Kinney. I don't think we've seen the last of him or Fay. I'd love to see them again in a future novel."
2,A missed opportunity,"Bill Werber led an interesting life on and off the field in baseball, but this collection of anecdotes from the 1930s and 40s misses the opportunity for Werber to explain how he felt about one of baseball's biggest problem in the first half of the 20th Century: segregation. Werber was a vocal opponent of integration in the 1940s and openly opposed the selection of Frank Robinson as the first African-American manager back in 1974. If Werber could have explained his positions on these matters, this book would have made a lasting impression. Instead, it just sort of floats by without making any impact."
4,Before you buy them from here...,"The product is good. I have no complaints there. The filters are even compostable, which alleviated my only concern.What I recommend, unless you're a shut-in or live smack in the middle of nowhere, is checking around at some stores in your area. Recently, while at a giant home store that rhymes with ""Schlowe's,"" I saw that they had this exact same product, same count, everything, for about $2.50-$3. Regardless of the seller, with shipping you're looking at paying at least twice that here. Just a suggestion."
5,Not quite what you think,"I admit that I was a bit turned off by the possibility of a sappy environmental message. But if you are too, give it a moment. Most of the animated stories aimed at your kids involve ""evil villains"" and probably a decent amount of physical conflict. My daughter's at a stage where she is very sensitive to ""evil"" characters, so I decided to check the movie out. Yes, Leonard is right - nothing very memorable... for an adult. My 3-yr-old child saw this film a month ago and is still acting out scenes from it and making me play characters. And it's true that there is the sappy environmentalism of animals tut-tutting the way those humans act. But I'll give away a tiny surprise. The humans turn out to be not all bad."
3,Off to A Good Start,"David Nevin's historical novel, Eagle's Cry, covers the election of 1800 until the time of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 using the Madisons, the Jacksons, Aaron Burr, and a couple of fictional characters to tell his tale. The novel has a gripping beginning in the election of 1800 covering the tie between Jefferson and his vice presidential nominee, Aaron Burr. The book, unfortunately, loses some steam with the section portraying the Louisiana Purchase. It was not as tighly written and suspenseful as the election as it meanderend like the Mississippi itself through the lives of all the characters. It worked very hard for historical accuracy, and achieved it to a great extent, but sacrificed to history any element of surprise. The history was good but the drama suffered at times for that. Definately worth a look for the first half of the book and it is a good omen for the next book in the series as it will be dealing more with the behind the scenes Washington politics."
5,Ferris is one of the best...,"A nice companion volume to Coming of Age in the Milky Way. Ferris surveys the current state of modern cosmology and astrophysics. This book could serve as an excellent introduction or review of the state of such topics as string theory, the dark matter debate, the Hubble constant, etc. As always, Ferris' writing is clear and a pleasure to read."
3,"Iffy, but good price.","I use this with my computer phone. The quality is in and out for the sound. Sometimes it's great sometimes it isn't. My friends also complain of a reverb if I have the headset volume up too high. The upside is that it does work for a good distance so I can leave the computer and not worry about loosing the signal. Probably would end up spending more next time, to get a higher quality headset. But for my uses right now it works just fine."
2,I AGREE THE LIVE VERSIONS ARE NOT THAT GOOD,"TRUST ME. NEIL DIAMOND IS NO SINATRA OR DEANIE MARTIN LIVE. PLUS THE RECORD IS MISSING SOME OF THE BEST SONGS LIKE DONE TOO SOON, ONE HAND ONE HEART AND HEARTLIGHT ARE NOT ON HERE. GET THE ORIGINAL GREATEST SONGS RECORDS INSTEAD OF THIS ONE."
4,I liked it a lot!,True Heart is about when Tibs and Heart go looking for Joseph Laquier. Tibs wants to see him so his dream can come true. Tibs wants to be a blacksmith. Heart wants the unicorns to be safe. Joseph Laquier makes some armour for Moonsilver. I think True Heart is one of the best books I have ever read. READ THIS BOOK!
5,Adorable Highchair,We orginally wanted the Expressions highchair from Evenflo--but they were sold out. I actually liked this one better. Our 4-1/2 month old daughter loves looking at the chair pad. It is very eye catching. Definetly not plain!!It was so easy to put together. So far-- we haven't found anything wrong with it. Well-- it doesn't roll very good on carpet--but hey what casters do. I wish it came with a mat to put underneath--but I think that comes separate.
4,good steam cleaner,"Cleaner does a good job all most carpets. Use it for small stains and high traffic areas. We still use Stanley Steamer usually in spring to do entire house. Although this unit does a good job on spots it is way too time consuming to do large areas and leaves area too wet. Had older version and developed a crack in the water supply canister. This seemed to be a common problem with the older units. I hope they improved on this. Also spot brush didn't hold up well on older unit either, it broke within first two years."
3,A good product with a totally misleading name,"I wonder why Amazon would call this item ""MIU France Stainless Steel Juice Extractor, 3 Domesby MIU"" when in fact the box does not say anything of this item being made by MIU (does not even has a single french word on it) and it has a ""made in china"" sticker. The juicer does it job and seems to be made of stainless steel 18/10...But honestly you should change the misleading item description. At a first glance the four small pins, at the base of each dome, to keep the domes attached to the base when in use seem like a potential weak point. I really hope they last..."
3,Nice effects but some assembly required,"There are a lot of good ideas provided in this book for some very cool effects. However, please know that many of the effects/settings are very specific to the images they use in the examples. Your results will vary greatly with your own photos so it will take quite a bit of tweaking."
1,Not a fan of guided reading,"My work is primarily with children who struggle in learning to read (and adults). The preponderance of evidence shows that guided reading is not the intervention/reading instruction that is most beneficial in helping them to catch up to their peers. I do use some leveled readers, but mostly prefer texts that allow these students to analyze individual word sounds/phonemes, instead of memorize words as wholes, rely on context cues/picture cues/repetitive patterns."
1,Has A Great Title,"If only the author stuck to what he proposed he would deliver, this would have been a great book... all a reader is expecting to get is practical mail order businesses they can start. The estimated profits to be made from some of the ideas are just too impractical, and yes ridiculous! You can tell he is just guessing his way to the end of this book."
2,Good but too basic,"Good basics, but lots of stuff not covered if you own a wood stove.Like how to build a top-down fire.How to deal with cold-chimney syndrome if you have a wood-stove. (Solution is given for fireplaces, but not stoves)."
1,Don't bother!,It took 20 mins to fill a car tire from 20psi to 30psi. Truck Air? -- It could barely fill a car tire. It would take over 3 hours for it to reach 300psi if it even could make it. STAY CLEAR.
5,DVD right on time!,This DVD was a gift for my husband. It arrived in time for the Holidays and he has enjoyed watching it since its arrival.
2,Not Good!,"This game isnt good. I've never played the old version, but this certainly isnt much fun...a fetus could win it, and its boring.The music in this game is decent though. I'd say this is a good kids' game but for older folks it stinks."
5,Tha Carter is #5 of the top 200 albums,Tha Carter is #5 of the top 200 albums on the billboard charts.
1,WAY TOO LONG for what it is!!,"Really too bad. I was looking forward to reading this book way before Oprah recommended it. The stuff with Chip should have been condensed into a few paragraphs. He wasn't that interesting of a person anyway. The book wore me out and depressed me. So they had a bad childhood, who didn't. I have seen too many married couples like Al and Enid so that was the good part of the story. I just have to say I do not recommend this book at all. I finished it but felt awful afterward. I must add I will never read another book by an author who is so very stuck on himself. After the rude things he has said about Oprah he should be ashamed. I do not read books because she has recommend them. But he should be glad that she caused a lot of people to buy this book before word got around as to how bad it really is. Because then he wouldn't have sold any."
4,What Candide should be,"Listening to this cast recording was a more pleasurable experience than sitting throught the boring and labored 1997 revival on Broadway. Yes, it's over the top but it should be. The singers sound like musical theater singers instead of overblown opera. You lose a little with the reduced orchestrations, but it has a style and a pace that I don't hear on the other recordings. I could have done without so much dialogue, but it definitely worth the purchase."
1,Not even a quality coaster...,"When I ordered this there few reviews and SO sorry I did so. I have the wonderful original video (VHS) of the Making of Band-Aid and my family watches it every Christmas season. I only watch VHS around Christmas as I have every other genre on DVD. Any-who, this is a rip-off, not informative, and totally lacks the joy of the original."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!,"DO NOT ORDER THIS ITEM!!!!! EVER!!! Not only did the razors not shave my legs, it took a ""minimum"" of four runs!!!Do you know what that does to legs? These were obviously refurbished razors and repackaged. DO NOT BUY THESE!!! PLEASE!!! You will end up with razor rash; they are not sharp at all, and will only bring misery. Sadly, I was trying to save money, but it's not worth it. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!! I ended up buying replacements in the grocery store, but at least I had a clean shave. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!! YOU WILL REGRET IT!!! THEY ARE ""REFURBISHED BLADES OR FAKES!!!!"". THE RASH FOR WEEKS IS NOT WORTH IT!!!"
4,"Great book, false ""title""",Great inside and prespective of the untold story of forgotten units of Marines. However the title is misleading. There were Marine Special Operations/Forces Units in Nam and those were Reconnassaince units not CAP Plts.
1,No excuses,"As the narrator says, ""take a break from reality"". The Swamp Fox is classic Disney revisionist history, but it's still plenty of fun, especially if you can remember the original broadcasts in black and white. BUT, as other reviewers have stressed, the disk contains only the first three of the eight episodes. Episode three even has the trailer for episode four, but that's where it stops. For as long as this set has been out, it's clear Disney has no intention of releasing the remaining episodes. I recommend not purchasing this incomplete issue."
5,"A new, valuable introduction to Int'L Law","The 7th edition of this classic among student textbooks builds upon the clarity and stile Michael Akehurst was famous for, and gives an up to date introduction to International Law. The author, Peter Malanczuk, Professor of International Law at the University of Amsterdam, included systematic references which will enable the reader to begin a journey into the advanced subjects of the Law - if he/she so wishes. Malanczuks perspective is broad and serves the needs both of students in International Law and in International Relations."
5,This cd is GREAT,I just got this cd and dont regret it one bit. I love it. It sure was worth it. BUY THIS CD NOW! U WILL LOVE IT!!
4,Fun collection,"I quite enjoy travel stories, and this collection is a fun read. I dipped in now and then. Some of the stories are sublime, while others are just so-so. Well worth a read though."
5,A Blessing,This is a very informative book. It helped my understanding of end times prophesy. This is a difficult subject to understand from just the bible but you have to be very careful where you get information from. This is an excellent source.
4,On the Road with Bella & Eddie,"This book is alternatingly heart-warming and frustrating, but isn't that life? Bella is a beautiful earth mother to whom Eddie is attracted like no other. Her drug-induced behaviors lead them to split, but he carries a torch for her. The book has some interesting levels to it. Eddie is raised with an insensitive father who refers to him a ""numb nuts,"" gets spirituality from a New Age conquest, and then rejects God altogether. Bella goes through a series of relationships, and eventually pulls her life together. This is a wonderful episodic adventure. The book gives you the feeling that we are on a life path whether or not we are aware of it. It is a great tale recognizing that sometimes it takes time to pull your life together. Enjoy this one. It's a fast fun read!"
3,Over priced tips,Good Practical advice but pretty basic and not enough on fishing. A guy should have got most of these tips from and his dad or cranky uncle. I just expected more on fishing from a respectd angler for that price.
1,Peter Cetera Is The Voice of Chicago !,"How can Chicago be Chicago without the voice of Peter Cetera? I'm hoping that Chicago releases a music video compilation on DVD with Chicago songs from the past when Peter Cetera was with them, Chicago's music DVD's are not so impressing these days til one is released with Peter's voice included in it!"
2,"Storage, nothing more","Works okay for storage, but so would any bag or box. Had to replace the first one I got because the latch was warped and wouldn't stay latched."
4,Good supplement,"You cannot learn everything in the few months/weeks leading up to boards. I think this book was helpful to me because it had good memory tricks...and I can remember something better if it makes me laugh. I read it 3 times in the coffee shop over the 10 months leading up to boards, but my primary text was Zitelli. I passed even though I was doing a fellowship in neonatlogy at the time. I passed."
4,Splendid!,"It gives an objective perspective of the ""other side of the story"" - as each and every real-life drama has. We are used to see Diana's saga from her perspective - this film gives you a background of Charles'pains, tribulations, and his own unfulfilled love."
1,Don't buy - CD has a trojan!,"I started using this book and it looked excellent. I put in the CD and was using it with the text. When I tried to shut down my computer later it wouldn't shut down - said ""Winclickme.exe"" wouldn't close. I restarted the computer and did a search and found that others had had this problem from the CD - please see other reviews for more details. It is really too bad because the book looks great and it is one which needs the CD to be used for practice."
3,Slow......Again,"Ok the first book was good, the second slow, the third one picked up for me and now, I'm having hell (pardon) getting thru this one. Last book we spent a lot of time trying to figure out where Buck and Rayford were and now we are looking for Chloe and Amanda. I think it's becoming a bit repetitive, but hopefully it speeds up again."
1,Predictable and inane.,Right from the very first page this book proved to be disapointing. Michael was a dolt and Ellen even worse. I confess I gave up at about page 200 - blissfully never to return. Are they all this bad?
1,Read the Instructions,"So I thought fresh meant I could eat it out of the box, much like I would fresh apples and pears. Apparently not. After devouring three pounds of fresh whole rabbit out of the box, I have spent the last week in the hospital. Be sure to read the instructions. Apparently you have to cook the rabbit."
1,Deadly,"Against my better judgment, I began to read it - at the urging of a friend - who wanted me to explain it to her. Previously, I had worked with her on reading Proust and again on reading Faulkner.I regret the time I spent on the first 80 pages before I threw it away. Roth's Pulitzer Prize winner is wordy, whiny, deadly."
1,Pissed off OWNER,"Just another pissed off owner of this game. I haven't read over the 1000+ reviews, but I'm sure people have already complained about how the manual plainly states that more than one account can be added to a single installation of the game, which is a BOLD-FACED LIE!!! In order for my wife and I to have separate accounts on the copy THAT WE PAID FOR (ARE YOU LISTENING, EA?????), we have to BUY ANOTHER COPY OF THE DAMN GAME!!! Give me an F-ing break. This just drives honest people to pirate games. I might as well start searching warez sites for some kind of crack. Bite me EA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1"
2,Not so great mixes and a lousy Spanish-language version,"I think that earlier Madonna single remixes have been so much better. Both Beautiful Stranger and American Pie are two examples. Here, on this single, the remixes aren't ""signature"" sounding. I think all of these remixers have pulled all the tricks out of their bags. Will someone new step up to the plate?I probably would have given this single 3 stars, if it weren't for the AWFUL Spanish version of WIFLFAG. The translation is weak and contrived, and Madonna's delivery is so laboured and grating to the ear. Is this the same woman that gave us the awesome ""Veras (You'll See)""? Although Veras wasn't flawless, it sounded so much better translated into Spanish than this dreck."
4,"Never fear, kids, the story's gettin' better!","I *really* enjoyed getting not only some backstory on Kathryn Pulaski, but also some knowledge of what she did *after* she left the Enterprise. It's nice to have some blanks filled in so expertly!This story increases the complexity not only of the plotline, but of the virus itself. Great character interaction between Dukat and Pulaski. Good insight into life on Terok Nor before the Feds stepped in.Another step further along the twisted double helix of this story. Let's hope the next one is just as intriguing."
4,A good little cultivator for the $$,"Purchased as an attachment for my TroyBilt string trimmer. Wasn't sure what to expect as far as power but this attachment digs right through soil backed by the TroyBilt 31cc motor.It is a bit cumbersome to handle for tall folks. Has potential to really get away from you. Make sure the handle on the shaft is tight. For the price, this is great way to turn over the soil."
5,Great Product! Highly Recommended!!!,"This is simply the best garlic press I've ever used.It's just the right size (not too big and not too small), highly efficient, durable, and easy to clean (non-stick).Made in Switzerland."
5,A stunning read,"A heartfelt memoir, beautifully written. Carole is a fascinating woman with an incredible story and her strength is something to be admired. One would think a princess would not be relatable to your own life, but she definitely is. Tragic, but also inspiring."
1,Crosswind--take me away!,"I recently read ""Crosswind"", and I found it--well, I found it longwinded and pretentious. Ms. Valdata's overly embellished style brought tears to my eyes--tears of joy when I finished plowing through this monstrosity. The unending melodrama of college student Ellen Horvath's life, complete with soap opera like twists and turns, left me aching for more--more substance, more reality, more true literature. Read this book if you dare--but be prepared for every literary device any professor ever taught you in creative writing 101."
5,Gentle yet firm prenatal yoga,"I have a few prenatal videos, and found this one to be a good addition. The gentle stretching has been great in my later pregnancy, with just enough strength building to help me get some needed exercise. I really like the specific suggestions for postures to do for helping the baby to be in the best position for delivery, such as postures for a baby who is still breech or occiput posterior."
4,"Great, Gritty Film","It is alot like ""Get Carter"", the protagonist is seeking revenge for the death of his daughter. It is a very dark film filled with excellent performances. Once I started watching it, I could'nt tear myself away until the very end."
5,Jigsaw Insects,Really enjoyed this puzzle. The pieces are nice and durable.I only wish that the names of the insects had been included.
5,A visual feast,"Exquisitely beautiful. nature as an art form, something like a very small Japanese garden. Magnificent photographs. This is like 3-D Chinese landscapes."
4,77c 2200,"Used it twice. So far has no problem using it. All projectors are heat producer.When finish using it, may need to let it cool down prior to putting back into the bag/carry-on nylon case.Price is affordable relatively. Resolution is about right (if native resolution can be one level up, say, 1600 by 1200 then it would have been ideal)"
4,Beats a bag,"The Bucket organizer with 61 (!) pockets gets filled pretty quickly, so make sure you buy a bucket bag with MORE pockets than you THINK you'll need.Works to dry paintbrushes after cleaning and holds all the painting prep tools, while holding everything but the poles.Using it for general drywall work, it will hold the router, screw gun, tape in center - pretty easy to grab quickly, and loads of incidental tools, but tapers, DON'T put your good drywall knives in a bucket. Your most used hanging tools will be in your bags, so this will make an easy carry - just get a bucket from your taper.Following this purchase, I saw a very good one at Sears for only 12.95, with pockets in the 42 range.This is why it didn't get all the stars."
4,afro-american history,"I love this book; the history of africa is diverse and cyclical, and proud like a lion"
4,I'm happy with these earbuds,These have been a nice replacement to my apple in-ear earbuds that finally gave out about two months ago.
1,Incompatibility,"The most disappointing thing about Microsoft Works is that it doesn't ""work"" well with other applications. For example, the database tool does not appear to be compatible with programs written in Visual Basic 6.0. It appears that I now need to buy Access as a stand-alone product, when I feel that Works should be as useable as Office with Access. Half-star rating."
4,Impressive,"This is a most impressive and realistic recreation of the terrifying consequences of this recent natural disaster. This is no maudlin tear jerker, and fortunately does not rely on special effects for its impact.It is simply a very well acted drama which probably even underplays what must have been sheer hell, although that is not to say the film in any way falls short of conveying the true tragedy of the event.It has the even greater merit of having been made for TV, which one does not normally associate with this scale of production. If this interests you, and you missed it on TV, get it on DVD - you won't be sorry."
4,"Great for authentic beach in the day, not good for sleeping","This CD is not for sleeping. To repeat another review, it has some loud birds and fog horns that would wake you up. It is wonderful for when I just miss the beach so much I can't stand it and I can close my eyes and pretend I'm there."
2,The Big Let Down,"Lindsay's books usually mean tight plots with plenty of inside details about how the FBI works, crackling action scenes, and believable dialogue laced with humor. This book has it all except for the tight plotting, and without the tight plot the other ingredients don't hold together very well. The humor is good, the insider details interesting, and the dialogue excellent. Unfortunately the meandering plot is so loose the book kind of falls apart. Think of this book as a cake with every ingredient except the flour. Lots of sugar, baking soda, and eggs but the key ingredient is missing."
1,This book is poorly written,"I am a christian and I was prepared to cut this book some slack because I believe in the message, but I found it too pourly written to refer this book. The writing is equal to a c- high school composition by a below average student. I hope someday a better writer takes on the challenge to do a book based on the rapture."
3,Amazing results!,"The Canon BJC 8200 and Photo Paper Plus will give unbelievable results, better than any photo paper I have used. You won't believe it. I print my digital photos and they are as good or better than from a film camera. I have scanned and repaired old photos, and on this paper they come out perfect. My friends didn't believe that I printed the pictures myself."
4,Good for small jobs,"Most recently we used this product on a smelly, slow draining kitchen sink. Initially we used it on the garbage disposal side. Didn't work. Then we used it on the other side of the sink. This time it worked like a charm.One time, there was a major clog. The product didn't work, but neither did the first plumber we called. The second one (or main guy who had been on vacation) was able to unclog."
4,Good times,"I bought four of these recently and have them stacked. They work well, and the included software is usable (works fine on Windows 7 64-bit). In fact, it makes batch adding discs pretty fast. I've got ~150 DVDs loaded and I imagine it took me about two hours.Pros: Cheap (I paid $29/each), stackable for great expandability (up to ten for a total of 1,000 discs), looks decent, fast roboticsCons: Absurdly bad stacking design (six small metal pins that you must align without seeing them, easy to bend), I'm unclear if the manufacturer still supports it.Bottom-line: If they last for a reasonable amount of time, I'll be a happy camper."
5,"Personal feelings of ""THE PACIFIC""!","After viewing The Pacific, my Brother in Law was a member of the 3rd Division and landed on Iwo, I have to say I have no problem with the dropping of ""THE BOMB"" on The two Japanese city's. The series followed the true march of the US Marine's thru the Pacific very close. My regret is so many fine young Marine's lost their live's in the march across the Pacific to defeat Japan."
2,A joke is funny only once,This movie seems to turn in cirles. The first wedding is still funny but seeing the same joke over and over again gets boring. The scene pretty much repeats itself for 90 minutes.
4,"Brahmins, Intellectuals and Hell","For a first novel, Matthew Pearl's The Dante Club is astonishing in its readability, twists and turns, and general information about the Boston and Harvard environs during the post Civil War period. Real life characters (Holmes, Longfellow, Lowell, Eliot and more)are Dickension in nature, and the plot is similarly comparable. A book to be read carefully, the Dante Club is unique. Not a book for the faint of heart, the plot unfolds with a gruesome murder, minutely detailed, which is followed with more of the same. Academia, quotes from Dante, lowlife and highlife characters, all combine to create a soup of mystery and shock. For the reader who likes intellecutality combined with his or her mystery reading, this is such a book. I look forward to reading what Pearl concocts for his next work of fiction."
5,Good Book!,The item arrived on time and came in fairly good condtion for a used book. There were no pages missing and everything was caefully intacted.
4,A good backstop to any trip to Boston's sites,"We purchased this book in Boston and found almost all of the sites we saw in town in this book. In this book, the older, up to 150-year old photo of the original structures on the current site, or older pictures than offered a juxtaposition of the surrounding landscape of buildings present in the past and now around selected sites.While I was a little disappointed in no picture of Fenway Park, or in a map to help locate where some of these pictures were taken in the city (after all, I'm not a native of Boston), I found the book to very ably support the exhibits we saw on Boston's history, and add greatly to my understanding of the city and the growth of urbanism in general. The architecture depicted is often unique, and the descriptions offer a bit of information on who the architects were, how the areas shown were constructed, and more.Overall, I came out pretty pleased by what is found in this book."
4,Leather Trench Coat,"I purchased this coat as a gift for my son. He loves it. It does have some issues with buttons being loose and some of the stitching not holding, but for the price I paid, it is a very nice leather coat. I checked around to see if there was anything comparable at a little higher price, but could not find anything. I read the reviews and decided that even tho it had some bad reviews, the good reviews outweighed the bad. He is very satisfied with the coat."
5,Excellent read,"Winning Angels is a ""must read"" for anyone in the VC world and a great guidebook for anyone wanting to break into the VC world. The book is clear and concise. Ideas/concepts are clearly explained with the aid of great graphs and charts. In addition, Howard and Dave have not only drawn from their expansive knowledge on the subject, but also from other experts in the field."
1,Horrible Headache,"I bought this today from my local CVS. I took one pill this morning with breakfast (I'm only 94lbs, so the huge doses scared me). After a few minutes I started to feel anxious, like I had too much coffee. I couldn't sit through Church or focus on what the preacher was talking about. I've had a dull headache around my temple area, and a ton of pressure behind my eyes all day. I will give it a few more tries, but I don't think it helped me focus at all, if anything, the side effects made my focus worse than normal."
4,Still Exceeds The PS2 Version,"When it comes to the Playstation there are games that have improved when they were remade for the Playstation 2 and there are games that look and play far better in the Playstation 1 version and Tetris Plus is one of them. Unlike Tetris Worlds where you may get different modes of the game it didn't feel like I got as much to offer or only so much of the feel of Tetris when I tried this game for myself. On the other hand Tetris Plus had the more colorful classic mode, the puzzle mode with 100 different puzzles not to mention the option to create and try your own puzzles and the vs. mode to test your skills against another player and all had the exact feel and challenge of tetris as I remembered it. If you want a tetris game for your Playstation this is by far still the better choice."
4,Good Kettle,This kettle is worth the money. It heat water very quickly. It does not have the plastic smell like some other brand. it is a keeper.
3,Campy Fun,"Was not a great monster film. But it was never meant to be taken seriously. It's a good campy throwback to monster movies of the 50's and 60's. This is this first movie I ever saw Mary Elizabeth Winstead in and one of the main reasons I bought this DVD. Adam West has a turn as a ""mad scientist"". He does a good job of it."
1,Thumbs Down!,"It is unfortunate that Amazon is selling a product that only uses proprietary files. The ability to read and learn is what has advanced mankind. Now Amazon wants a monopoly on what we can read on a device we own. Why can the Kindle on read proprietary files? What if I have other eBooks or other files (I have 100s of pdf files that are loaded with knowledge)? Why sell us a $400 product that can only be used for files only Amazon sells? I liken this to a monopoly. Please Amazon, open this up! You have the potential to have a great product, but you restrict its usability severely.I think it is interesting that the only people who are giving this 5 stars are the ones who are somehow involved with this project."
5,Thank Goodness for CNBC!,"I am a CNBC junkie -- I just can't get enough, particularly when it comes to understanding what's going on in today's crazy markets. This book not only has same straighforward approach you find on CNBC, it also provides you with an invaluable analysis of how markets work and a list of resources where you can get up to the minute information on world markets. Any book that will help me make sense of what the current stock market is doing will help me feel confident in the choices I make as an individual investor and is worth the price. I highly recommend this book. Thanks."
1,Worst vaccuum ever,I bought this model and have used it twice and I'm taking it back for a refund. It doesn't pick up much of anything and if you lift from the floor anything it picked just falls out.
5,A great Deep Purple album,"Come taste the band is one of the best albums from DP which consists of David Coverdale,Tommy Bolin,Glenn Hughes,Ian Paice and John Lord.This terrific album consists of Two cd"" of the best music made by Deep Purple and is highly recommended."
1,Pure propaganda!!!!,"This movie is pure political propaganda plain and simple....Small movie for Small minded people!!!!It is another attempt to make it seem as though there was some big conspiracy dating back to the 60's about making some ""illegitimate"" baby the first Black President 50 years later...."
4,Quality product,"Everything I expected from DW, a quality product from a quality manufacturer. I'll have this one for a long time, I'm sure!"
3,Cheap feeling but work,"I had an older version of these headphones that lasted for years, big, metal and really good sound. I figured I might as well replace them since the ear cushions were starting to wear out. I was very dissapointed when these arived, they are no longer big heavy duty feeling headphones, but cheap, plastic, small ones that look like a Chinese knock-off of my old ones. The sound is fine, not ""surround-sound"" but works fine. I originally bought them becasue i was having sound issues with my on board sound card and needed a way around it, they work well for that but don't expect to be blown away, they sound no different then regular headphones.Bottom line: If you need a quick solution for getting sound out of your computer these will do the trick (linux, pc, mac) but don't spend more than $25 bucks on them or you will feel ripped off."
4,EXCELLENT ADVENTURE!!,James V. Smith is a gifted action/adventure writer hands down. This 1st in an exciting series is a non-stop adventure with quite the interesting characters. Swayne and his small team of Force Recon team are up against everything from extreme weather to extremists group terrorists.For those of you out there that like action/adventure at its best - this one's for you!
1,Melted in microwave,I sent this back. It melted in the microwave I left it in there cuz in order to get kids to use something it must either be attached to them or in the place it is to be used. Well it was in the microwave and we placed something atop of it and it melted
3,Misled,I was disappointed that only a brief edited version of this debate was on the dvd. Don't buy it if you want to watch the debate. There's only about 10 minutes of it on there.
3,Should have option for hard wire,"The functionality of this device once setup is great. I'm using it for a disposal and hot water dispenser.However, I don't understand why ISE makes this as a plug-in only device. Almost every existing disposal is hardwired to a Romex cord coming out of the wall. In order to use this device in an existing installation, you would need to install a new receptacle from the existing Romex wire and then plug this switch into it.I would prefer the wiring for this device to be like their disposals where you can easily hardwire it or wire in a regular power plug."
5,Into Great Silence,"Into Great Silence is more an experience than a film. It captures a spirituality that takes your breath away, stills your soul, and leaves you savoring the quiet. The length of the film (2:45) is necessary in order to convey the rythm of monastic life, and it does it successfully."
2,No Depth,"This book was a tremendous disappointment. The characters had no depth, and the romance was nonexistant. I had to force myself to finish this novel. The writing was hurried, and the dialogue was sometimes hard to follow. This book has few highlights. I bought this book along with another in her vampire series; I'm very reluctant to read it. Linda Lael Miller has a much better vampire series."
5,Give me more!!!!,"Kayak's second studio album after the reunion, and the first to feature Bert Heerink on the vocals and Rob Vunderink on the guitars. These to new guys really added a new sound to this Kayak-album. The have convinced me that this is their best studio album since the reunion.The opening is an 8-minute plus epic about Icarus. Beautiful, and Heerink sung it very emotional, he sings that way in every song. Miracle Man is also very good. All of the songs are very well done except Tradition. That song has a nice guitar-riff, but it's too longwinded. Can't help to say that there are pieces of the song which deserve the name: superfluous. But the rest is well done. Now that they have two guitarists it sounds a little nicer.I recommend this to Kayak-fans and if you are new to Kayak, this might be the right compact disc to get you into Kayak.Keep On Rocking!!!"
4,George Michael?! This is too good to be...,"Having never been much of a fan of Wham, or, for that matter, of George Michael himself, I wasn't expecting much from this album that came to me as a gift. I was more than pleasantly surprised when I first listened to the gentle songs of this collection. No one who has listened to this album of mine believes it really is George Michael. You've got to listen for yourself!"
1,Don't waste your money on this junk,"The alarm is difficult to shut off, takes about and hour of goofing around with it. One time I had to disconnect the whole thing to get it to shut off.This unit started popping fuses and over charging the battery after I had it for around 12 months.I sent it in once for service, which cost me $100 plus shipping.After about a year, it's doing the same thing again. Popping fuses.I'm supposed to send it in for repair again, but instead I'm going to throw it in the trash and look for a better quality pump.Also, I did a careful measurement and my unit pumps less than half the advertized gallons per hour, even when considering the pipe losses.I spend around $600 on this junk including the battery. What a complete waste.Absolute garbage, save your money."
3,You can haggle price,"I was in the mall a week ago and was attacked by a salesperson for this product. Now, I'm a guy, so was not really impressed with the product, but thought they would make good gifts for ladies this year (mom, sister, etc.). I balked on the price and wound up getting 4 for $100. Yes, $25 each. Could have possibly gotten them lower."
5,Great Card. No Problems at all.,I use the Sandisk 512 SD card in my HP 2215 IPAQ. I have never had a problem with it and it gives me plenty of space to store all of the music that I enjoy. I would love to get a 1 GB card but I want to wait for the prices to come down a little more. This card is fast but I would still like it to be faster. I'm not sure if it is the card slowing down the process or the USB connection to my IPAQ. I was thinking about buying the Sandisk ULTRA SD card to see if there is a speed difference.
1,Boring,"I never thought I would encounter an Elizabeth George mystery as bad as this one. Her prior books have been riveting page-turners that kept me up all night and then gave me nightmares when I finally went to sleep. This book, in stark contrast, was, in a word, dull. I got about half way through it, and skimmed the rest. The characters were both boring and improbable, and there were no flashes of intriguing domesticity to hold my interest. The relationship between Simon and Deborah is absurd; not only does their marriage seem doomed, as far as I can tell there was never any reason to imagine that it could have been anything else.This is a poorly thought-out, poorly conceived, and poorly written book. I hope that Ms George can redeem herself in her next book; otherwise, it will the last one I buy in hardback (or, indeed, at all)."
5,The Swan Princess (Special Edition),Awesome movie - it's my daughter's favorite movie and it was her number one gift that she wanted for her 14th birthday!
5,Awesome,"Man, this game is the bomb. I loved command and conquer Red Alert that i played at my cousins house and thought id buy it. then i saw all of it (red alert, expansons, c&c, and its expansions) all in one box. and it was only a little bit more $$ so i thought why not. i love them both and the expansions rule. they are the coolest games i have for the computer and i cant wait to get Tiberian Sun."
5,Selenium is purported to reduce the risk of certain cancers,"I have been using 100mcg of the antioxidant Selenium daily for the last eight years. My doctor back then recommended Solaray and I have kept with this brand.Selenium is as essential trace mineral and functions as part of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione perioxidase. It is bonded to the essential sulfur amino acid, methionine.According to the FDA's website:""Selenium may reduce the risk of certain cancers. Some scientific evidence suggests that consumption of selenium may reduce the risk of certain forms of cancer. However, FDA has determined that this evidence is limited and not conclusive"".There is no way of me knowing how much good these supplements actually do. Just to be sure, I have my servings of fruits and vegetables every day!(I also take100mg of Grapenolas an added antioxidant, twice weekly).All's well so far :)"
3,There is a reason why people pay to get haircut,"I brought this kit with a thought - ""why am I spending $30 for which I don't care much?"". This was my first attemp of cutting my own hair and I guess the kit did the job as described, but I can tell you that it wasn't easy at all. I was going to clean up the sides and back, but ended up giving myself a very short buzz cut... If you're ready to pay the price, this product is for you..."
1,Worst effort to date.,"Monster Magnet have truly lost it. I was hoping that they would recover from that abomination God Says No. I was hoping it was just a little hicup and that Monolithic would bring back the sound and energy of the old Monster Magnet. I didn't think it was possible, but Monolithic is even worse than God Says No. It is an insult to their fans. Don't bother."
3,Somebody hyped this movie?,"You've got to be kidding. This little-seen direct-to-video has to be...well, seen to be believed. It's intentionally campy, and done on a ludricously small budget. But once you get past that, it's great fun as every imaginable horror-snowman possibility is explored."
5,Excellent wood turning tools!,"Can't say enough good things about PSI wood turning tools. I thought I could get by with just a handful of turning tools, but I still find projects for which I need a different tool. Fortunately, PSI tools are reasonably priced, so I can afford the tools I need. The tools are excellent quality, and they sharpen easily using the grinder jig I made."
5,Simply Incredible,"Okay, the cd is so incredible, it is easily one of the best in my collection. Some have written this off as a cheap rip off of such bands as Theatre of Tragedy or Tristania, but if you listen, there is much more talent than Theater, and Tristania recently is more industrial goth sounding. For example, Theater of Tragedy does no double bass drumming, but in some tracks on Perpetual Desolation the double bass ranks with Satyricon as far as speed(if you dont know what im talking about, listen to ""A Tormented Soul""). If you havent heard the music I would reccomend going to the bands... and listening to the samples there. The Sins of Thy Beloved are extremely talented but go about showing there talent in a very delectable and beautiful manner. The only band that i would consider better is Opeth, for obvious reasons. If you are a conniseur of goth metal or just curious about it, this is a great cd to buy, it is sorrowful and beautiful goth at its finest.Absolutely fantastic."
3,Use lightly in the Winter ...,"I normally use this product during the Summer,but was running low and needed to stock up ...Either Aveeno has changed their formula ormaybe because I've reached the age of 50, myskin has less oil on the surface, but I'm finding Idon't need to use much of this product duringthe Winter ...Twice a week is about all it takes,whereas during the Summer, every other day."
2,"decent keyboard, useless mouse","Having used Microsoft Ergonomic keyboard 4000 for a year now, I thought, it might be a good time to upgrade to this wireless keyboard/mouse. I was wrong. Keyboard is good, except for the missing capslock and numlock indicators. However the mouse is crappy, the worst mouse design I have ever seen. Who in their right sense of mind can come up with such a design, I wonder. Extremely uncomfortable and results in wrist and thumb-joint ache within a few hours of using it. I have since switched to the good old wired mouse. So, am left with an expensive wireless keyboard. Advice - go for Microsoft Ergokeyboard 4000. It is much better."
1,Terrible,"Personally I think that this is the worst book in the series. When Jake was ranting on about the Yeerk invasion he said to believe it was true it was futile, futile, I was tolerant but then it grew worse when Marco's jokes were getting really, really bad. And when Marco's jokes get really bad something's got to be wrong. Even so, after this book (except for #12 and 14) Marco's jokes have taken sort of a dive. They aren't funny anymore. Don't make this mistake again, Ms. Applegate."
5,Fantastic movie,"It is one of the best movies I've ever seen. All actors are real great, but the best are David Bowie and the unbelievable Takeshi Kitano who acts as the Yakuza-Boss in Johnny Mnemonic, every movie with Kitano is real great, also his japanese movies. Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence is better than River Kwai and it is more interesting to see the characters, who are really terrrific, than to see the typical american war-heroes in River Kwai. Im Mr.Lawrence wins no one a battle against the other, the prisoners only want to survive, they do not want to fight against anyone, only Bowie is a little bit rebellish."
5,MUPPETS!- and a nice use of DVD technology.,"I loved the movie, but I bought this for the DVD extras. I like it when DVDs do something that could only be presented on that format, and this movie's ""live video commentary"" fufills that. It brings up a little row of theater seats, MST3K style, and the director and various Muppets comment on the film. Just as funny by itself- like 2 movies in one! Plus some funny outtakes, a music video, and other stuff. A good, low-cost DVD, and a fun movie, great for little kids."
2,"So far, disappointed.","I bought the drive with many expectations, based on some other reviews, but I am not very happy so far.First of all, it doesn't bring instructions. It brings a dual USB cable, but I don't know which connector two use. Sor far, it seems that both connectors are necessary all the time, when the hard drive works. If I want to buy an external power source, no specifications are provided other that the 5V DC printed on the case.Second, I have Windows XP, and it seemed to recognize it at once, the first time I connected it, but I am disappointed seeing that it doesn't work all the time. Honestly, I don't know if this is a problem with the operative system, the connector, the energy provided bt the PC USB ports, or simply that the drive is not working properly.I managed to test the hard drive with the Wire Fire cable, and it worked well, but the problem is that most PC's don't bring this type of ports."
5,A Must For Lovers of CSI,I just love CSI and I think forensics are absolutely fascinating. This book has an amazing attention to detail. It's a book that really gets you thinking. Wecht truly reveals some gripping discoveries in these cases. A worthwhile read.
5,lol it's a cable,"lol - what do you expect? I opened my delivery and ... yep it was a cable. Works well, I run at 100 Mbps and this cable did not drop my speed."
4,Better than I ever expected!,"I sat down to watch this very skeptically. I had heard bad reviews from critics- whom I'm convinced are all crabby old men. This was a delightful comedy about Jane, a hopeful romantic who is timid and kind. She goes thru a life-changing transition thru meeting Kevin, a journalist at a local paper. He shines light on the fact that she's been in 27 weddings- yet never as a bride. This is a pretty clean film too- not a lot of cussing, sex, etc. (I even loved the fact that they made Jane's boss- whom she is secretly in love with- a truly nice guy. He is a good guy till the end.) I can't wait to watch it again!"
1,*SIGH*,this cd stinks mega...one of my friends has it and i heard it and it just makes me hate them more....i wish they'd just go away...this cd is the pits...
5,Excellent sleep mask.,"This us the most comfortable sleep mask I have ever worn. The contoured eye area prevents the mask from touching the eyes, which is always bothersome in other masks, and the adjustable band with velcro, permits a perfect fit around the head, in contrast to others that always feel too snug. Though a tiny sliver of light appears at the bottom, this is absolutely no problem. The darkness in the morning, when my room is otherwisevery light, is perfect."
2,10 pounds of story in a 5 pound bag,"Crimson Empire II continues the story of Kir Kanos, last of the Emperor's Crimson Guard out to avenge the Emperor by killing everyone responsible for his death.The first book was fairly clear-cut, focusing on the battle between Kanos and a renegade Crimson Guardsman responsible for killing the Emperor's clone bodies. But this is one is all over the map. It introduces several new factions and players (including a Hutt gangster who could give Jabba a run for his money) but never has enough time to properly flesh them out. We see them plot and scheme but it really has no impact since we're never given a chance to care about them.Kir Kanos it practially a supporting player in this story, since so much time is spent throwing in new aliens, new factions and new alliances.This series desperately needed to be longer, or an editor needed to give it more focus. Most readers will leave disappointed."
3,Hmmm...,"Machiavelli's The Prince is a great illustration of one of the best thinkers of that time. However, for the not-so-avid historical/philosophical reader, it came as a pretty hard pill to swallow. While reading I often found myself, reading and rereading and doing the same process again to fully grasp it. Not a one day read, as could be deceiving by the lack of bulk in the abridged version. For those who enjoy the historical and the idealist lifestyle, take a stab at this true work of brilliance. But don't be surprised if you find yourself sitting down and after an hour's time, only reaching page 15 and still not seeing how people call this guy a genius. You've got to be in the right mindset to read this, so don't prepare for something weak, this one is heavy, so brace yourself with a cup of coffee (maybe with an ample amount of brandy, that you'll most likely adhere to strictly once you hit the particularly granular middle of the text) and enjoy."
4,Worth Reading,"I am a fan of Ann Quindlen's books. This one confused me at times, but other than that I thought it was a wonderful story. I think that the story of Mrs. Blessing and the realtionship of Skip was very well written, however the flashbacks sort of confused me a little bit, cause they just flashbacked without starting a new chapter. But its worth reading. I also loved the book Object Lessons and Black and Blue."
5,It is all clear now.,"My understanding of the universe is complete now after listening to Mr. Bungle. XM, I love u! I am a fan of ""Weirdness Special X"" and it was one afternoon after listening to Mrs. Miller singing a Beatles song that all of the sudden the sky opened and Pink Cigarette from Mr. Bungle's California played. I was like, ""damn! This music is delightfully weird!""I immediately proceeded to my closest Virgin Megastore and I got the self titled Mr. Bungle's first CD. My reaction? It was like being strapped to a chair getting a haircut from a deformed and scary clown from hell whistling a scary melody and being terrified of what the hell bound clown can do to me with the scissors. Do you get the message? I could not move a single inch until the CD was over and when it finally was, I had to listen to it again.I bought Disco Volante and California as well. Buy them! They are well worth it!!!! Thank you, Mr. Bungle. I am a complete human being now."
4,Midge Ure - Answers To Nothing,Midge's second album. Very melodic. Released after leaving Ultravox and divorcing his wife. the title track is quite innovative with the drum solo and the softness of the singing. This CD has many highlights and few troughs. You will not be disappointed.
3,Shake and Bake,If you like somewhat affected old vampire queens who view themselves and the gay Miss Marple you will have fun with this lite mystery.
5,"Good product, great price","This product works very well and makes bringing in wood a breeze. I was a little concerned because of some of the other reviews, but ordered it anyway and am very pleased. Well made and a bargain."
1,Consider the source,"Considering the publisher, Regnery, tells all discerning readers what they need to know about this tome. This is merely an election-year preaching-to-the-neocon-choir diatribe being used to negate the incumbent's scant military regard by demeaning the more distinguished service of his chief opponent.As opposed to the Michael Moore film, ""Fahrenheit 9/11,"" heavily vetted and for which the producer provides line-by-line documentation of factual claims, ""Unfit"" is based almost exclusively on personal accounts made some 30 years after the fact - each of which is specious in its own way, whether it be the previous statements of the sources or the official record. Documentation is rare and does not conform to the specific allegations.This is only for those who read without exercising critical analytic skills."
5,Essential background for the mess we're now in,"I read Harvey's book when it first came out. I'm not an expert on this subject, but the issues he raised in a highly accessable style worried me, although no one was talking about them at the time. Now, they're front page headlines. We think these decisions just happen, then discover when we read a book like this, that they're product of huge political interests, and that we, the ordinary citizens, pay the toll.A wonderful rallying cry for a more democratic approach to key energy issues.Paul Loeb Author Soul of a Citizen: Living With Conviction in a Cynical Time [www.soulofacitizen.org]"
5,Great title,"Actually I don't remember buying this game =S But i'v definitely played it and I'd recommend it always. Is a great action game that requires fast hands and good thinking, the history is also memorable and I can't wait until the next one.5 of 5"
2,Please apply Max factor,"After the sad demise of 'Roots'-era Sepultura we are left with Soulfy and a new Seps lineup. Whilst Max's offering was a little too formulaic for some, relying on tried and tested song structures, the new-look Seps disappoint for another reason. The unique brand of guttural heaviness boasted by 'Roots' has gone. This is, it pains me to say it, run-of-the-mill metalcore. Mind you, 'Hatred Aside' and the title track aren't bad... But 2 medicore albums later there's going to be a few people a bit narked at the reality of never being able to hear anything new from classic Sepultura again."
3,OK,"This pen suits it purpose, the only complaint I have is that the bottom laych/lock is loose and my puppy tried getting out and got stuck. Looked like it hurt. I went out and bought more hooks and it's fixed."
3,Didn't live up to potential,"I thought the beginning few chapters were pretty interesting and thought they would set the tone for the entire book. I didn't come in to this book with the thought of comparing it to any other novel, but I couldn't help but compare it to the Outlander series, due to the fact that after reading the first few chapters, I could tell that this author was a fan of that series as well and the fact that the author even brought up the characters from the Outlander series in her book - that was a little bizarre - why on earth would anyone do that? You're just begging to be compared. I thought this book had a lot of potential but unfortunately didn't live up to it. I am not interested to find out ""what happens next"" because I'm not interested in the main characters. I thought the ending was a lame attempt to make sure people would read the next book. And I believe it is premature to call this an ""epic story""."
5,I luv this CD! with Karoke,I love this CD the High School Musical did a good job for singing skills I love the CD and I do not get sick of it AWESOME CD! 10 stars
3,"Great film, Bad acting","To get started, this happened in Venezuela in 1989 where the now president Hugo Chavez led a military uproar against Carlos Andres Perez. It wasn't a success thanks to him, every other military group took their place all over the country, all except him. It brings with it also live feed from the real thing whitch is what saves the film but the bad part is that the actors are way too cool for what's going on."
3,Okay,"It's a little small and doesn't save that much space in my fridge compared to the large one. Also the whole white insert part tends to fall out when you pour the water out, so you have to hold it on. I'll keep it, but would buy the larger one if I were doing it over."
1,Not as Advertised,"This penlight is being advertised as a 6 pack, which is a lie. Only one pen comes in the package. There are better quality lights out there for the price. I would return if it wasn't such a pain for something so small. Do not purchase."
1,for dummies is right,"I just read some of the positive reviews and I cant believe it! This book is so vague and so spotty, that it cannot be relied on at all. And on top of that, the paddy-cake paddy-cake language is downright obnoxious!!If you want to be able to actually do something, then I would go to the wrox programmer to programmer series specifically the professional active server pages 3.0."
2,I want to like her.....but.......zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"My head says I should like this cd, but my heart doesn't agree....quite frankly....this is pretty boring stuff....it's typcial Early 2000's fare....so-called ""serious"" lyrics with a folk rock slant.....I like the light and airy sound of ""Wrong Impression"" and I wish she'd have tried to not take herself so seriously......this cd doesn't have anything as annoying as ""Torn"", but it doesn't have anything that memorable.....I hope Ms. Imbruglia tries it again.....she has a lovely voice and somehow I think I'll give her another chance if she records again."
1,almost all puzzles are the same,"Seems at least 75 percent of all the puzzles are of the same category - where there are statements which may or may not be true.Many of his other puzzle books are also just as filled, if not more so, by endless knights and knaves, that is, non-liars and liars.I don't need more than just a few of that type of puzzle.The few puzzles I did find interesting were not the author's own, but traditional known ones.How greatly disappointing that an author could just keep filling his books with such similar material."
3,This Ain't No Disco,"Although there is just too much dissonate junk (""Drugs,"" ""Electric Guitar,"" etc.) here for me to rate it as great record, FEAR OF MUSIC has some great moments.The first 7 tracks are all very good--I especially like Byrne's no-nonsense guitar at the end of ""Mind""--and ""Life During Wartime"" is the ultimate gallows-goodtime record.The shocker here is the fine-print on the back of the CD, which reveals that the entire album was recorded in two days in the spring of 1978.Two days?!? In 1978 it took Pink Floyd that long to find the On/Off switch on their synthesizers."
1,Poor,"Although the seller shipped promptly and I have nothing against them, the fit of these thongs is terrible. They are too tight in the pouch and the thong strap is very irritating. I wear thongs daily and love the feel, but these are going in the garbage."
5,I LOVE MY KINDLE!!!!!,"I purchased my Kindle 2 about 18 months ago. I was having trouble seeing and was not able to read even the large print books any longer. I truly missed being able to lose myself in a good book. My Kindle 2 gave me back the ability to read again because I can enlarge the font. It is also so easy to download a new book. One of the best features is the fact that even though I enlarge the font, the printed page redistributes itself so that it looks just like it was written that way. I have traveled a few times with my Kindle and I always get questions about it. I still have a lot of trouble seeing and probably always will but with my Kindle I know I will still be able to read, read, read! Thank you for creating this great reading tool. I LOVE MY KINDLE!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Menolly is now at the Harper Hall. However, she is a geek/nerd and doesn't fit in with all the girls who like doing the standard chick things. Plus there just happens to be a bunch of fire lizards following her around.She also has to deal with the problem of choosing or being asked to choose a specialisation and someone to be a mentor."
5,"A Brilliant Tale of Wine, History, and Innovation","This is one of the best books I've read in a long time. I loved the the history and, as a wine lover, it helped me understand the product and the industry in a way I never did before. I am a management professor at Stanford, so the best part for me was reading about the innovative practices used in the wine industry, the constant experimentation and information sharing that should serve as model for other industries. After reading this book I realized that the wine industry, not the computer industry, is the best model other firms and industries that want to flourish. I'd give this book six stars if I could."
4,great show. bad release order,i like the one season per dvd but they are releasing the seasons way to slow & too expensive.[...]
1,DVR....Not DVD.,"Picture & sound quality rate 1 star, movie itself, rates 2 stars.Horrible transfer brings little enjoyment of this movie.Defeats the whole reason for having DVD.As for the movie itself, low budget ""southern gothic"", slasher film.Last film role for Agnes Moorehead. She's wonderful in the film, but even she can't save this dud of a movie. In the same vein as Dementia 13."
2,You WILL Be Crunching on Coffee Grounds!,"The other reviewers have properly characterized this product. I like it, but it has that one fatal flaw..."
2,ok book,"would call this more of a fast read handbook, most of the stuff in here is known to a beginner already so i didn't find it so useful."
5,Great for car backseats too!,"Bought this for the backseat of my Ford Focus because I can't use the ones with hooks in the backseat, and I love it! Has velcro on the outer edges so it sticks to the seats and stays in place. Has had 2 rowdy, mudcaked mutts on it and not a speck of dirt has gotten on my seats. Absolutely perfect, love this product!"
2,Its too repetitive and boring,"My husband and I started doing Bible study at home, this was the first book we got. We wanted to learn more about our marriage as well as learning more about God's way and becoming closer to Him. This book is WAY too repetitive for me, it seems that some of the weeks are repeated later, and mainly things that you have learned from the time you were younger, like Adam and Eve and how the woman should be at home and the man at work.. I am 29 and hubby is 39 and we have been married going on 8 years. If I am ever asked this will not be a recommended reading. We are trying Gary Chapman next. We aren't having huge issues, but there are always issues in anything in life, and we want to learn to cope with them better and communicate with one another better."
5,3 Years and still going,"Brought this hub three years ago and it's still working fine. I would not use it to plug in devices that require ""data transfer"". Most of theses items I have the manufacture recommends that they be connected directly to your computer through its USB ports. I have found this to be mostly true. Additionally, some devices causes my computer not to boot up when connect initially. No problem...I just wait until computer has booted to plug them in."
2,I could write a better book,It alright but the characters are flimsy the plot is weak and totally unbelievable. Why the 1700's anyway? Im 16 and i could write a better book. In fact i think i will. Watch out for a fantasy book that will blow the socks off this folks!
2,"Watch good, band not.","Watch is nice. Clasp was nonfunctional and could not be made to work properly. Fortunately had a similar watch band to replace the bracelet. A for the watch, F for the band."
2,greatly disappointed,"I saw the commericials on the television and I thought that this game looked like my kinda game. I prefer video games that are adventurous without bloody killings and with lots of tasks to accomplish where rewards are waiting for me. However, when I finished the game in 4 days, I couldn't believe my adventure was over. This is by far the shortest PS2 game I have ever played. I think that the game could have been much longer and included more exciting adventures and tasks. The graphics are great and the no loading is great too. But, I think the creators could have created more for Jack & Dexter to accomplish before the game came to an end. It was too easy. This game may be great for younger children, but for adults that are looking for fun challenges, I do not recommend this game."
5,Very good reading but certainly a work of a bad taste,"This book has two things which good book needs: first, it's a work of extremely talanted man, second, it's a book of a person with which you'll never agree. Voltaire was one who talked about bad taste of Shakespeare, but his taste is really extremely bad. When you begin to read this book, you think it to be a work of honest man, but in the middle of it you see that he was just a tricky politician. But it all just adds fun to the reading."
1,Big disappointment...avoid this brand.,"Our family makes these gingerbread houses every year at Christmas time - in completely different environmental conditions from hot and humid to cold and nippy. So we have lots of experience putting the houses together so they stand in any conditions. Despite it being cool and no humidity this year, the frosting in this kit was just soft and unable to hold the house sides up or the roof on. The kids finally just gave up and piled the pieces on top of one another."
5,Gets the job done.,"Nicely made product, easy dishwasher cleanup, and does an even and excellent job at whisking x x x x x"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM.,This is a total waste of money. Do you not purchase this item. It is not what you think it is. Don't waste your money.
3,Wrong Mario (guy up top),"I can see you're confused! You've got the wrong Mario. You're looking for Mario Winans (A.K.A) the winer. You're right though, all he does is complain. He might as well do a Cd complaining to God about Satan."
3,Good watch but a small size,"I bought this watch recently. The watch was good and has all casio features. Nice watch definitely. But, the image in the website looked bigger to me but when i ordered the watch, I found it to too small on my hand and felt like I am using a ladies watch. Anyway,its gonna be gifted to someone as I dont find it useful to me. But, features are nice for this watch."
1,Rotten Movie,"If you're smart, you won't even waste your time on this one. Not only is the movie cliche, it really doesn't make much sense. I never did figure out what the mute boy had to do with anything in the film. I am surprised Morgan Freeman even took part in this horrible movie."
2,Don't buy this - these are re-recordings - buy the originals,"Don't buy the Capitol Andrews Sisters CD's - these are re-recordings done in the 50's. They tried to copy each song exactly but you just can't recapture the original spirit of the times in which they were recorded, the sister's involvement in those times caught in every note, the spontenaity, and the jazzy bands over 10 years later. The originals are about 50 times better. I recommend The Andrews Sisters - Their All-Time Greatest Hits (MCA) - this is a far superior CD - all the original recordings from the 40's with neat DECCA replica label on the CD's and great liner booklet."
1,Avoid,"What I really did not like about this movie was how it showed people from the Middle East. People from the Middle East were depicted as terrorists who want to blow us up, so we have to kill them first, to protect ourselves. I wish one of the ""good guys"" in the movie could have been from the Middle East, so that people don't go away from this movie thinking that everyone in the Middle East is a terrorist."
2,Thorough but out of date.,"Book is from before 2001 and was missing key fish now widely available for purchase for a freshwater aquarium. Book arrived in fair condition, Not bad considering it was on old Library copy. More pictures than information. I was hoping for a book on how best to keep a freshwater tank, not as a reference to species and compatibility."
1,Did not work at all,"I don't know if our local retailer got a bad batch of these or what, but we purchased 2 of these sets (and returned two) because the base was mixing up the letters. (D = F etc., etc.)My preschooler was so disappointed.This is the third Leapfrog product we have had major problems with. Does anyone else have problems with Leapfrog?"
2,Broke quickly,"Worked fine for a few months, then it got stuck on Celsius and can't be set back to Farenheit."
5,Comprehensive Reefkeeping Information,"Excellent book. There is quite a bit of information for the reefkeeper from novice to advanced. Covers water quality , aquascaping, plumbing, equipment, lighting, water movement, feeding and more in depth. I wish I had read this volume before starting my first tank. It would have saved me a lot of money, time and frustration."
2,a great book to read if you like to be frightned,"I am a mother of six children, I read this book with baby number three. I was scared out of my wits. I didn't need the hassle. I think that educating your self about chidbirth is a good thing, but, it gets to the point in this book that you are afraid of EVERYTHING. I was worried about every test I didn't have, I was worried about every test I DID have. I think this book should have focused on basic need to know details, especially for first time mothers who really worry to begin with. There is such a thing as too much info to take in and digest."
3,"nice shower bar, missing chrome caps","Really nice shower bar, easy to install. However, the bar is chrome but it came with non chrome round caps for the mounts.Also, it's not obvious but the handle articulates to adjust the spray angle."
5,"Incisive, precise, haunting","I had the pleasure of seeing the St Lawrence perform the 3rd quartet and went out and bought this CD immediately after. It did not disappoint. In fact the 8th is the best interpretation I have heard so far of this disturbing, enigmatic work. Forget that this is the ""Shostokovitch"" year - you will not regret owning this CD - each time I listen to it, the more I hear.Wonderful.Tony Warren"
5,"A hysterical view of the ""Singleton"" life. MUST READ!!!!","I have only begun to take up reading again, this book is a book most single women can relate to. I couldn't put it down, laughed out loud, avoided answering the phone, (1471 to find out later who it was...lol)was late for work just to finish. Us ""Singletons"" can so relate to the ""Emotional Fuckwittage"", commitment phob, or downright loser men that Bridget has spent her life wasting time with. Also, the calorie, fag, and alcohol unit counting is true to myself and all my ""Singleton"" friends. This book is funny, cynical, and yet very real, I can now legally change my name to Bridget Jones, as I am her, she is me (lol). If you are over 26 and facing your days single, and concerned about your weight and vices this book will make you laugh at yourself while laughing at Jones."
4,Good Headset,"I just got them and I have only used them a few times, but I like them a lot, great sound quality, comfortable. I recommend them."
1,Should be called the Bird Proof Squirrel Feeder,Bought this on Friday returned it on Monday. Save your money this is a total waste of space. The only birds that were able to get any food were grackels and an occassional house fince. The squirrel found the metal cage a wonderful thing with many sturdy places to hang on to while he dined on seeds from the bottom feeder tray.
5,Book review,Product was delivered in a reasonable time and in the condition described. I am pleased with my purchase.
5,Amazing,"This album is amazing. Each time I play it, I get a new feeling, I get touched by the songs in a new ways. This album is all about our love for God and God's love for us. Just as the title suggests, it's about the declaration of our love and need for God. ""Live it Out"", ""Magnificient obession"", ""declaration of dependence"", ""No Greater Love"" reinforces the theme over and over again. Yet all the songs have a different beat,a different rythmn, a different mix of brokeness, excitement and need so you'll never get tired of listening to them over and over again. I was awe-strucked by ""God is God"". The message is so clear; we are all just human with limited vision so we can never understand everything. That's why we are in constant need for God and in constant amazement of the wonderful things that HE is capable of.I really liked ""Signs of Life"" and ""Speechless"" too but Steven Curtis Chapman is now even better with this album!"
4,Nice assortment of colors,Nice assortment of colors.They don't smear the text you are highlighting over.Clicky (retractable) highlighters are more convenient than capped ones.If you need highlighters these are a good package to buy.
2,Poor Quality,My 4 year old son received this for a birthday present and was quickly frustrated with it. Very difficult to operate for a child (even we adults had some trouble). Poor quality - save your money.
3,a little disapointing,"This cd is marginal at best. I liked the first few tracks on the cd, but after that it all kind of sounds the same. There arent any instrumental 'hooks' or riffs like on 'Full Collapse' - which is what got me into the band to begin with. The lyrics are pretty cool, and the cd has its good moments. Overall I was disapointed with this cd and would recommend ""Full Collapse"" over this cd if you are looking for a Thursday album.www.jhombi.comwww.purevolume.com/jhombi"
3,Deffinately not there best,"This CD just didn't impress me the way that ""..Mindcrime"" ""Empire"" or ""Promised Land"" did. While, musically this is a good CD, Queensryche has had better stuff.Couple of standout songs (The Voice Inside and Some People Fly) but on the whole, just OK."
2,Not as good as I expected.,"I was expecting a book with the same quality of storytelling found in the Belgariad and in Belgarath the Sorcerer. Unfortunately I was disappointed. The book started off great, but slowly went downhill. Certain parts seemed inconsistent and silly. The book just didn't portray Polgara as the regal and mature figure that was developed through the Belgariad."
2,The good and the bad,"OK, I will admit it, I am a Bruce Johnston closet fan. Now having said that, stick with ""Going Public"" it's full of the hooks and sappy balled writing that we have come to love. By the way If I just reviewed Going Public I would have given it three stars."
1,HDV users beware,"Very nice program. However, I encountered a flaw for HD users utilizing, as I am, A Sony HDR-HC1 high definition camcorder. The program crashes on attempted capture of video from that device. Numerous attempts have been made to rectify the problem, from hours of discussion in online forums to unanswered online requests to Sony support. The software has been re-installed and all capture options carefully utilized-- all with the same crash on attempted HD video capture. I can capture HD video from my HDR-HC1 camcorder to Adobe Premiere Pro 1.5 without problem. The same attempted capture to Vegas 6 crashes that program. The same problem occurs on different computers, so the crashes are not a camcorder or computer defect. So, until Sony rectifies this problem, I would caution potential buyers to be careful of Vegas 6."
5,Believe everything you read about this CD!,"I have seen Chris Smither perform live twice. This is as close to the real experience as you can get. Everything the other reviewers have said is absolutely true. He is a unique performer, the pure exhilaration is incredible. Don't miss this chance to hear a master!"
1,NOT for Hamilton Beach Single cup Brewer,"I bought this product about a week ago and it absolutely DOES NOT work in my Hamilton Beach brewer. If that is the coffee pot you have (model 49970) then do not buy these. Its not just a weak cup of coffee, its basically water. I tried regular ground first and then espresso ground and neither worked. They are also a pain to fill up because they are so small and get coffee everywhere. Don't get me wrong, they SEEM like they will work because they fit so perfectly into the compartment. But they don't. I loved my coffee machine when I first got it because the Senseo pods were so great but now that they aren't available anymore and these stupid things don't work either its basically a worthless piece of junk sitting on my counter."
3,Timeless Classic,"Ah... the absurdity of it! Poor me reviewing the great work of Sun Tzu...Three stars! Take that!Salesmen & marketers, read Sun Tzu.Students of war & engineers, read Clausewitz"
1,Not your average quality build SOG. Feels like a $20 or less knife.,"So I received this knife about 10 minutes ago and well.. I'm not happy at all. I should have listened to David M. LePage Sr.'s review. He was right on about the quality of the knife. I was hoping that he maybe he received a bad unit. Not so or maybe, I received his return as it does appear this knife is ""used"". I will be posting some pictures before i send it back tomorrow. I also ownSOG Specialty Knives & Tools TFSA-98 Flash II 1/2 Serrated, Black TiNiAnd it's a far superior knife."
3,Needed a cheap hockey mask...,"On the request of my probation officer, I joined a local Inter-urban hockey team for delinquent minorities. I was axed to play goldie but had no money for an adequate helmet. In a rare stroke of luck, I found this kit at a local Goodwill for less than 20 dollars. Now pucks hitting my face hurt less, plus I will retain my natural youthful skin for years to come. THANKS REJUVINIQUE!"
5,One of the best nu-metal bands,"This album absolutely and incredibly ROCKS!!!! The best part about this cd is it has 16 songs, 67 minutes of music, and you never get bored one time throughout the entire CD. The best songs on this album are ""A Violent Reaction"", ""Song for the Suspect"", and ""All Wrapped Up"". Buy this if you like bands like Slipknot, Nothingface, Mudvayne, Slayer, Pantera or you just want a nu-metal band that is good."
3,More black than Cherry,"Very dark almost black. Haven't tried testing the load strength, as I just saw a review saying it breaks under load. Will update if so. Was cheap, looks okay, just darker than i expected."
4,Very nice metal flag pole,"The four pieces push together and then rotate to click into place but can be taken apart. The clips make it easy to get the flag on and off. The plastic end-cap at the base did come out, but this is somewhat to be expected. Will do a quick epoxy glue in and it should be good to go. The gold cap at the top is nice and appears to be affixed strongly. Time will tell if the top-cap is durable in terms of its finish. Very much worth the money paid. It's currently displaying the UA Crimson Tide flag as we approach the National Championship game."
5,Such an eye opener,"This book changed my life. It opened my eyes to see the many different manifestations of anger within me. I've been through psychology classes but nothing details the emotion of anger like this book. It's a meaty book but the best part (at least for me) is towards the end. It details the different levels of anger such as wrath and rage...it helps you understand what people are going through, especially with all these mass shootings. It gives warning signs of the different levels of anger one may unknowingly enter into. There's so much info (quality info) in this book, I encourage anyone and everyone to get this book for one simple reason... we all have anger, so this book applies to EVERYONE!!!"
2,not durable at all!,"I bought this for my son when he was 4 years old. I don't think we even had it a year, before the front wheel started wearing down. Now there is actually a big hole in the front wheel (just from a few skids, my son is a pretty cautious driver). I can't wait to replace it with something more durable. This is not at all like the original Big Wheel I had when I was a kid. And this is way over-priced."
3,Not Bad,"There were a lot of songs in the movies that I hoped would be on this CD, but they weren't. For the most part, it is pretty good."
3,Almost too comprehensive,"Oddly enough, I feel that this outline was almost too comprehensive to be useful for studying for my T&E law school final exam. The detailed outline is close to 300 pages long, and attempts to address every possible iteration of the law of Trusts and Estates, including common/federal and state specific law, the Uniform Trust Code, the Wills Act and other areas. In my opinion, this shotgun approach made weeding out the law applicable in my area from the other chaff extremely difficult. If the outline were organized in a different fashion, i.e., where how the issues in this subject were collectively addressed by the form of law (e.g., all federal law issues grouped together, all common law issues grouped together, discussion of UTC grouped together etc.) this book would have been eminently more useful to me. The sad thing is, the content of this outline is extremely good and detailed. Its organization, however, makes learning that content more of a chore than it has to be."
5,One of the best solo albums of the 1990s,"In today's country music market where the singers (both male and female) are interpreters rather than songwriters, Kieran Kane is almost an anachronism: he performs material he writes himself. His songs are deceptively simple, heartfelt, and melodic. Each song in this collection is well crafted and, altogether, comprise one of the best solo albums to have come along in quite awhile. Unfortunately out-of-print, here's hoping that Kane can license the tracks and release them on his own label."
2,Disappointed,"Having read the other reviewer comments, I am disappointed in this novel. I have not finished it yet and I am dragging myself through the story as if I were the 85 year old title character.In addition to finding the pace of the story to be slow, I find the use of time to be inconsistent. There is an obvious juxtaposition of time periods in the story, which is fine, but within the main time period shifts, there are also slippages between time periods that I find annoying.There are sentence structures that I find difficult to follow, perhaps because I did not grow up in the South.I may do this story an injustice by reading it while I am commuting by train but I am on page 229 of 344 pages, and I am still waiting for the story to catch my interest."
3,Another Slow Paced Oprah Pick,"Oprah picks generally have rich characters, but a slow pace. In We Were The Mulvaneys, however, some of the intriguing characters do things that seem completely incongruous when they ostracize their beautiful, popular, teenaged daughter because she was the victim of a crime. It doesn't ring true. Ms. Oats has a lot of talent, but this book was depressing."
2,Faulty design,"We have had the same issue as a few reviewers & also will never buy another Breville product. We only used it for making smoothies & stopped doing that, when it kept turning itself off after a few seconds on the purée mode. When it started smoking & caused one of smoothies to taste like burned rubber...we called Breville. They responded by sending us a new glass jar set, which although a nice gesture, does us no good, since the motor is worthless. The irony here is that my parents AND my in-laws, BOTH still have the Oster blenders they received as wedding gifts (over 50 years ago) & they still work! If Breville can't stand behind their product, with a design flaw they know exists, then NO ONE should be spending $200 on one. We now have a Blendtec at home & absolutely love it."
4,The content speaks by itself,"The movie speaks by itself. The extended edition presents many new scenes that will delight you.One drawback is that for Spanish speakers, the first movie (The fellowship of the ring) has NOT subtitled in Spanish.The additional material as always is very good."
2,where De Mille gave up,"Before this book the author seemed capable of great things and certainly showed a lot of promise. Spencerville seems to be sections of several different books, the most interesting what happens when the opposing sides of the Vietnam Generations reunite 20 years later.At some pont however he decided to stick a small melodrama into the pages and let it all go, and since then he has written nothing more than page turners, the last embarassingly bad."
4,"Simple, clear steps for turning your ideas into commercialized products","I found the book easy to understand and read. It was laid out very well and was simple to find what I needed.It was odd to find the last chapter was only 1 page. I need to know how to make money after I turned my idea into a product.Give it a read, it will help you. It helped me."
5,Vegan Cooking For One,"This book was purchased after I had borrowed it from the Library and tried some of the recipes.I find the recipes easy to follow, and very simple and straight forward. I have enjoyed all the ones I tried and found them delicious. One of the best part about the recipes are the measurements. They are for One. Therefore, no left overs, which means not having to eat the same dish for three or four nights in a row. I really enjoy this book and if you are a Vegan cooking for one, I think you will enjoy it as well."
4,Those were the days when players were illeterate-uneducated young men,"This book was written by one of the most famous baseball writer of the early 20th century. However, it's not a book about actual events by real life players.It's about a fictional character, a player from the minor league who gets promoted to the majors. In form of multiple letters to a pal, the character explains his life and hopes of being in the major league and his fear of being send back in the bush league.It's quite reveiling of the days when players were illeterate-uneducated young men who were at the mercy of the owners. On that basis alone, the book will instruct you as good as any other book what was life back then."
1,THE WORST MTV UNPLUGGED EVER.,"I LIKE SHAKIRA VERY MUCH, I THINK SHE IS AN INCREIBLE SINGER AND SHE ALSO HAS A BEAUTIFUL. FROM HER 4 CDS I LIKE THE MOST THE FIRST ONE ""PIES DESCALZOS"".BUT HONESTLY I CAN NOT UNDERSTAND HOW A MUSIC LABEL COULD RELEASE I MEAN THIS CD IS THE COPY OF HER ALBUM ""DONDE ESTAN LOS LADRONES?"",THE SAME SONGS...AT LEAST SHE COULD SANG SONGS FROM HER FIRST ALBUM WICH HAS MANY OF HER BIGGEST HITS OR MABY SHE COULD MADE A COVER, SOMETHING NEW BUT NOT THE SAME, COME ON CHECK THE SONGS...THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT I CAN'T UNDERSTANDHOW COULD SHE WON AN AMERICAN ALBUM FOR THIS ALBUM, I INSIST I LIKE SHAKIRA VERY MUCH BUT I THINK THAT TO BUY THIS ALBUM IT'S A WASTE OF MONEY-BELIVE ME.I WOULDN'T PUT ANY STAR BUT I HAD TO.I HOPE THE SHE EVER HAVE A CHANGE TO MAKE ANOTHER UNPLUGGED TO DO IT RIGHT-I KNOW SHE WILL."
5,back cover reads,"Here's an attractive and practicle collection of copyright-free ornanamental frames and borders that captures the beauty and intricacy of Celtic art. All borders appear on nonreproducible blue background grids that make layout quick and easy. Nine spectacular animals and mythical creatures: eagle, peacock, cormorant, heron, lion, dog, merman, mermaid and dragon and alphabet."
3,Dreamtorium,This album is different from his other cds that i have purchased so far i really enjoyed track 4 song the other songs were okay.
1,outdated,"outdatedeveryone pays with credit cards, so about 95% of the book is uselessVery strange and random drug referencesSounds like these guys were in their hayday in 1985, but now are just aging drug addict thieves.Justify it anyway you want, a thief is a thiefIm sorry i bought itsooooooooooo 1985"
5,Best Wall Hanger for Guitar...Great Price,I have 5 of these that each hold a guitar and have had no problems with them marking the neck or failing on me.
3,Strange movie,"Strange and psychedelic images interspersed with 70's funk and a lot of weed, it has it's good moments. But... This movie may offend the sensibilities of some folks. Only buy it if you want to see drug and sex comedy as voiced by one of the guys most famous for his role in the 1970's version of The Electric Company."
2,over hyped,just over hyped songs sound the same again again and againgave 2 stars because theres two good songs.THE END.
1,Terrible,"To put it in short, this movie is just terrible. I saw some of Clint Eastwood's other films, which I thought was of high standard. There was no character development in this movie, no depth and it follows a typical recipe, which so many other war movies followed in the past. It leaves no excitement and doesn't stay in one's thoughts afterwards."
2,Falls Flat,"Disney usually makes good movies. Dick Van Dyke usually makes funny movies. The US Navy usually chooses the films it will work with carefully. None of these is true in the case of this film.VanDyke plays a naval aviator who bails out over the South Pacific after an engine fire. He goes into survival mode on a deserted island. He is aided by an abandoned WWII Japanese sub which serves as his ""Wal Mart"", a marooned chimpanzee who found the same island after a space shot and an Island girl fleeing her tyrannical, head hunting father. The film is full of Rube Goldberg type gadgets to make life easier and the sub is always handy to provide for every need. The fight against the head hunters is lame and the hero does not get or want the girl but treats her badly. She doesn't take it too well either. The chimp is the only decent character.Stay away from this one."
5,Killer buns and thighs delivers!,"I have tried almost all of Jillian Michaels DVD's except for the Yoga meltdown which i plan on getting in the near future, but nothing tops this Killer Buns and Thighs workout. I was dripping in sweat 15 minutes in to the workout and I am a pretty in shape kind of girl. The plank to squat exercise killed me to no end. My thighs were on fire with all of the lunge exercises. And I am doing this review the day after and oh my goodness. MY legs are extra on fire. WHAT A GREAT WORKOUT JILLIAN but I dont know if I can do this everyday!"
1,NO GOOD FOR 24 HR. YOGURT OR SCD DIET. GETS TOO HOT!!,"I bought this because the SCD Diet recommended this brand. However, it gets too hot when you ferment the yogurt for 24 hours. My yogurt was 120 degrees and that's killing beneficial bacteria. The yogurt should be between 100 - 110 degrees at the most. Had I known this ahead of time I would have never bought it.It might be okay for 4 hr fermented yogurt but save your money if you are looking at this based on a SCD diet recommendation."
1,An okay book,This book was very very very very very very very very very very gooooooooooodAlthough it was a little too explanatory!
1,it was picture with indoor/outdoor grill. NOT ONE RECIPE for that.,"I was very disappointed - I ordered this for the Indoor/Outdoor George Foreman grill that it was pictured with - It did not have ONE recipe for that grill. Totally useless, only for indoor two sided grill. Why would you picture with this grill? I want to return in."
1,Bookbag,I received this item torn and the seller didnt cover as much as they should for shipping(return). I would NOT order from them ever again
1,LAME!,"I'm so glad I saw this as a Instant Play on Netflix because I would have been highly upset if I actually paid for this. It wasn't ""spine-chilling and deeply thought-provoking."" It was lame. Warren was extremely annoying and melodramatic. The ""scary"" monster voice made me laugh. I felt more like I was watching a mockumentary than a documentary. Don't waste your money!"
1,Aspect ratio is NOT 1.33:1,"I give this one star not because of the series - that easily rates 5 stars or more - but because the info for this version says it is in a 1.33:1 aspect ratio. The box is labeled 16:9. I already own the Signature Edition, which is also 16:9, but I was hoping to get a copy that was produced like the original series - in 4:3!If you don't care about what the producers did to the video to make it ""widescreen"", by all means, this is TV at its very best and I cannot recommend it highly enough. But if you're expecting 4:3, look elsewhere."
3,Fun Read,"This was mostly entertaining and I would recommend it to people interested in learning about Greek life. However, it seemed that she went into her research with the idea of that Greeks over drink and are promiscuous and set out to prove that known stereotype. In the book she claims that she went into the research completely unbiased and just wanted to find the truth. Yet, I personally do not believe someone can do this type of research free of bias even if they think they are. People are constantly hearing about the negatives of Greek life in our media so its only inevitable that these thoughts can through in the research as the author heavily focuses on the negative aspects of Sororities just like how they are portrayed in the media. I did enjoy the read but it aggravated me and I think it was completely wrong to reveal ritual secrets (even if they seem dumb to the outsider)."
2,Poor Kermit,"You know, when I saw that there was a Muppet's game I was thrilled! I rented it and got and home...then I was sad. The game has got to be more impossible then getting to the moon on foot. Play control is so akward, the sound effects could blow out your ear drums, and I never figured out how to get rid of enemies! It was so hard walk up onto anything, or down to anything for that matter. There isn't any reaction that tells you that you've hit and enemy, power-ups are scarce...and poor Kermit! He is short and squatty; he looks like a renegade from ""Frogger""! The game was poorly devolped and suffers from an unfortunate lack of imagination. If you are interested I suggest renting if first, and if you find that you have more patience than I then make a purchase, but don't blame me when your Game Boy goes out the window..."
5,Unique vampire romance,"A great first book in what appears to be a series. I bought this book on a whim after reading the reviews,and decided to buy it. I'm glad I did. I absolutely loved this book. It has a different take on the vampire. Lanie was a great female lead character and Mac was a solid male character. I liked the way she drew out the romance, it played into the story, it didn't become the story. I like plot, action, interesting characters and a little sex never hurts. This book had a great combination of all these necessary components for making a very interesting and enjoyable read."
2,A generic adventure for the Doctor...,"Ace has been away from the TARDIS for three years when events and time conspire to make her desire to return to the Doctor. Using a piece of technology, she links to the TARDIS, but one much changed from her time there: the Doctor has lost his memory and Benny is in hiding for her own safety...This book is a bit of a worry. It's purpose appears to simply be to return Ace to the TARDIS crew and to tell a mildly Dalek-related story (odd, since Virgin didn't have the rights to use the Daleks in their books...). It also features Absolom Daak, a charcter from the Doctor Who comic series, who is a Dalek Killer!Despite all these Dalek-related issues, the story has little to do with them. Instead we are served up what amounts to a generic Who opponent, who is defeated in a generic Who way.A lack of true creativity dooms this book to being, at best, a second-string novel in the long line."
3,alright,It was an easy to work with program but I wouldn't say it was as effective as they promote but than again maybe i was just to lazy.
4,Works.,"I put two of these under my tongue on nights when my legs feel restless or crampy. (I think my restless legs have to do with fluid retention, like right before menstration or when I've had a salty dinner.) Anyway, this works to calm restless legs - and pretty much instantly! However, about the 7th or 8th time I used it, I felt tingling in one of my feet that I also felt again the next morning. Not sure if this product caused it - but I can't think of anything else that would have, as it started as soon as I took it. Not sure if I'm going to use this product again"
1,"Not a Sony product even tho it is advertised as such, and it doesn't work!","I guess you get what you pay for. This replacement bulb does not work, am returning it to Amazon. I am surprised that they allow the bulb to be marketed as ""by Sony"", and it is not by Sony. It was based on that solely that I purchased this bulb thinking that it would be as advertised. I have bought one before from Amazon and it was the real thing. Apparently this knockoff's housing is not the same so it does not connect to the sensor. Not good!"
2,Porter at sea,"I'm a pretty untiring reader, as long as I have faith I'm in competent hands, but I gave this book up at page 160, which was enough of an investment to convince me that Porter was lost, lost, lost. I'm an admirer of her short stories, but all she's done in this larger form is expand the cast of characters, forgetting to give them anything to do. The characters are really only cartoons, which Porter seems aware of, since she doggedly gives us paragraphs and pages of analysis for most of them. But in a novel, characters define themselves by what they do, not by what they think about themselves, or what their creator thinks of them. The sheer number of them just hanging around listlessly becomes so unwieldly for Porter that you feel sorry for her -- you can almost hear her thinking, ""Wait, what about So-and-so, we haven't seen him come out of him cabin lately, maybe I'll have him get drunk and make a scene."""
3,Toy?,"As was noted by a couple of other people, the fan and heatsinks arrived, and one worked, the other didn't. I sent a note that the part was DOA, and eHobbies said I should go to the mfgr for troubleshooting help. Please. How do you troubleshoot a DC fan? Connect it and it either runs or doesn't run. Which I pointed out in the next email, along with a request for how I went about getting a replacement.At that point, eHobbies stood up and just sent me another heatsink/fan assembly. So it took a few days longer than I initially expected, but the two new motors now have ran cooled heatsinks, which will hopefully keep the motors from overheating.The new motors are high-torque, lower rpm motors, which for my 34 inch long, 20 pound RC motor yacht is ideal. We'll see how well they hold up."
5,Enteraining and full of great information,I've read several Love and Logic books and this is my favorite. I laughed out loud while reading this book and learned so much!
1,Looks good on picture but...,I had to return it immediately when I opened the box. On the picture it looks more blue than purple.
5,AWESOME LIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I'VE BEEN IN SPECIALIZED POLICE/SECURITY FOR 20YRS. THIS IS A GREAT LIGHT!I MADE IT EVEN BETTER BY USING DURACELL RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES.BRIGHT,COMPACT,DURABLE AND A GREAT PRICE!!!!!!!!"
2,Lid does not close properly,I like that it keeps the wipes warm but the lid does not like to stay shut. You have to press the lid down multiple times before it will stay shut.
2,poor sound quality,"I received this phone,it is cute and retro hoping to replace my WWTTON red retro phone but the sound quality in the Crosley is poor.There is a background buzz and when speaking on the phone the volume is too loud and this volume,unlike the ring volume, is not adjustable"
2,Doesn't seem very accurate,"This thing takes forever to get up to temperature and seems pretty inaccurate. It has temp suggestions for different meats on it, but if you actually go by what the thermometer says all of our meat comes out WAY overcooked."
2,leaks,I do not like these bags. The twist tie closure system is cumbersome. The bags are small. The plastic is thin and leaks in the freezer when frozen. The only advantage I can see to these bags is that they are easy to hook to the medella breast pump and pump into directly.
4,Good Stuff,This nailer works pretty good but at least with my 2 batteries it does not last very long. Shoots about half the nails its suppost to on a single battery. Maybe the rateing only applies if the depth is set to 1?Ether way its great not haveing to dig out the compressor and hose everytime I have trim work.It is severale times the size of a neumatic and a lot heaver.Was installing some crown a week ago and boy did it give my arm a work out.For one room jobs it works very good but for multiple rooms or a whole house the compressor gets dug out.
5,I think I sharted in my pants,"Dark, sick, Vulger, Twisted! but in a strange way it touched my heart... billy bob could only play this part this good.a Xmas must."
